Some of these policies require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. Management makes significant estimates in determining the allowance for loan losses, valuation of foreclosed real estate, and evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment losses of securities.\nManagement considers a variety of factors in establishing allowance for loan losses such as current economic conditions, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews, financial and managerial strength of borrowers, adequacy of collateral, (if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows) and other relevant factors. There is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as a result of regulatory examinations.\nForeclosed real estate is initially recorded at fair value minus estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Appraisals are generally used to determine fair value. After foreclosure, management reviews valuations at least quarterly and adjusts the asset to the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell. Estimates related to the value of collateral can have a significant impact on whether or not management continues to accrue income on delinquent and impaired loans and on the amounts at which foreclosed real estate is recorded on the statement of financial condition.\nThe Corporation records its available-for-sale securities portfolio at fair value. Fair values for these securities are determined based on methodologies in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820. Fair values for debt securities are volatile and may be influenced by any number of factors, including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, credit ratings and yield curves. Fair values for debt securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security. When the fair value of a debt security is below its amortized cost and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost, additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment condition exists. Debt securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The analysis considers whether the Corporation has the intent to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity and whether it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity. Often, information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing, making estimates of fair value subject to judgment. If actual information or conditions are different than estimated, the extent of the impairment of the debt security may be different than previously estimated, which could have a material effect on the Corporation's results of operations and financial condition.\nManagement discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related Management Discussion and Analysis disclosures with the Audit Committee. There were no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented within this report. Additional information is contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis regarding critical accounting estimates, including the provision and allowance for loan losses located on pages 37 and 55 of this report.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nExecutive Summary\nThe Corporation's net income available to common shareholders (earnings) was $12,004,000 for the full year 2017, compared to $13,086,000 of earnings in 2016, a decrease of $1,082,000 or 8 percent. The decrease in net income and earnings per share for the year was primarily the result of a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nTable 74: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Net interest income for 2017 increased $5,966,000 or 11 percent when compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the volume of commercial loans. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis) for 2017 was 3.84 percent, compared to 3.89 percent for 2016.

The growth for 2017 occurred primarily in the commercial loan portfolio and was funded primarily by an increase in deposits.\nThe Corporation's capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions.\nThe closing price for the Corporation's common stock (NASDAQ: CVLY) was $27.53 per share on December 31, 2017, compared to $27.24 per share on December 31, 2016, as adjusted. Cash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2017 totaled $0.516 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.044 or 9 percent above the cash dividends of $0.472, as adjusted, paid for the year 2016. Also, the Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend on December 12, 2017. The Selected Financial Data schedule, located on page 28 of this report, provides a summary of operations and performance metrics for the past five years in a comparative format.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe full year 2017, net income available to common shareholders of $12,004,000 represents a decrease of $1,082,000 compared to the full year 2016 earnings of $13,086,000. Earnings per share was $1.35 basic and $1.34 diluted for 2017 compared to $1.49 basic and $1.48 diluted for 2016. The decrease in net income and earnings per share for year was primarily the result of a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet interest income, which totaled $59,547,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, represented an increase of $5,966,000 or 11 percent above net interest income of $53,581,000 for 2016. The growth in net interest income reflects the increased volume of interest-earning assets, primarily commercial loans; however, the additional interest income from this new loan volume was partially offset by increased costs associated with the growth in core deposits and an increase in volume and rates paid for both time deposits and long-term borrowings.\nThe loan loss provision for 2017 totaled $4,175,000 as compared to the loan loss provision of $3,000,000 for 2016, an increase of $1,175,000. The increase in the provision was primarily a result of an increase in net charge-offs of $1,766,000 in 2017 compared to 2016 and commercial loan portfolio growth. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.19 percent and 1.18 percent as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increased allowance for loan losses reflected both the overall commercial loan growth for 2017, and the Corporation's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs.\nNoninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $11,443,000 representing an increase of $1,607,000 or 16 percent compared to noninterest income of $9,836,000 for 2016. Specific noninterest income increases included trust fees, service charges on deposits, income from bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of loans held for sale. Gains on sales of investment securities for 2017 decreased $115,000 when compared to 2016.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $44,986,000 representing an increase of $3,363,000 or 8 percent compared to $41,623,000 for 2016. Higher costs associated with: personnel, external data processing, charitable contributions and other expenses, accounted for the majority of the increase. The primary driver of the aforementioned increase in noninterest expense was the expansion of our business and consumer banking in and support services for our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $9,904,000 which was $4,018,000 or 68 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2016 of $5,886,000. The increase was due to a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $2,920,000 increase in pre-tax net income.\nOn December 31, 2017, total assets were $1.71 billion, representing an 6 percent increase compared to total assets of $1.61 billion as of December 31, 2016. Asset growth for 2017 occurred primarily in the commercial loan portfolio and was funded primarily by an increase in deposits.\nThe growth in core deposits included a $35,740,000 increase in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits for 2017 as compared to 2016. Growing core deposits remains a particular focus of the Corporation because the rates paid for such deposits are low, transactional activity on these deposits are a source of fee income, and a core deposit relationship provides the opportunity to cross-sell other financial products and services. The Corporation excludes time deposits in its definition of core deposits.\nCash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2017 totaled $0.516 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.044 or 9 percent above the cash dividends of $0.472, as adjusted, paid for the year 2016.\nThe Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend on December 12, 2017, the same common stock dividend percentage that was distributed in December 2016.\nThe Corporation's capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions. Table 9 - Capital Ratios, following, shows that both the Corporation and PeoplesBank were well capitalized for all periods presented.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe full year 2016 net income available to common shareholders of $13,086,000 represents an increase of $2,071,000 compared to the full year 2015 earnings of $11,015,000. Earnings per share was $1.49 basic and $1.48 diluted for 2016 compared to $1.60 basic and $1.59 diluted for 2015, as adjusted for stock dividends. The decrease is primarily a result of the issuance of 1,746,850 of common shares in the $34,500,000 public offering completed in December 2015. The Corporation used the funds from the public offering to redeem the remaining $12,000,000 of shares of Series B preferred stock issued under the U.S. Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program, as reported on a Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016. In addition, approximately $19,800,000 of the net proceeds were invested in the Corporation's Bank subsidiary PeoplesBank and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nNet interest income, which totaled $53,581,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, represented an increase of $5,753,000 or 12 percent above net interest income of $47,828,000 for 2015. The growth in net interest income reflects the increased volume of interest-earning assets, primarily commercial loans; however, the additional interest income from this new loan volume was partially offset by increased costs associated with the growth in core deposits and higher long-term borrowing costs.\nThe loan loss provision for 2016 totaled $3,000,000 as compared to the loan loss provision of $3,500,000 for 2015, a decrease of $500,000. The decrease in the provision was primarily a result of a reduction in net charge-offs of $1,246,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.18 percent and 1.13 percent as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increased allowance for loan losses reflected both the overall commercial loan growth for 2016, and the Corporation's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs.\nNoninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $9,836,000 representing an increase of $1,281,000 or 15 percent compared to noninterest income of $8,555,000 for 2015. Specific noninterest income increases included trust fees, income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales, service charges on deposits, income from bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of loans held for sale. Gains on sales of investment securities for 2016 decreased $298,000 when compared to 2015.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $41,623,000 representing an increase of $4,196,000 or 11 percent compared to $37,427,000 for 2015. Higher costs associated with: personnel, charitable donations, external data processing, debit card processing, FDIC insurance and other expenses, accounted for the majority of the increase. The primary driver of the aforementioned increase in noninterest expense was the expansion of our business and consumer banking services in our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2016 totaled $5,886,000 which was $1,073,000 or 22 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2015 of $4,813,000. The increase was due to higher pre-tax net income and a slight decrease in the amount of tax-exempt income.\nPreferred stock dividends for 2016 were $16,000, a decrease of $104,000, compared to $120,000 in 2015. The preferred stock dividend rate for both years was 1 percent. On February 18, 2016, as reported on a Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016, the Corporation redeemed the remaining $12,000,000 in outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock issued under the U.S. Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program, resulting in the reduction in dividends expense for the year.\nOn December 31, 2016, total assets were $1.61 billion, representing an 11 percent increase compared to total assets of $1.46 billion as of December 31, 2015. Asset growth for 2016 occurred primarily in the commercial loan portfolio and was funded primarily by an increase in deposits.\nThe growth in core deposits included a $37,694,000 increase in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits for 2016 as compared to 2015. Growing core deposits remains a particular focus of the Corporation because the rates paid for such deposits are low, transactional activity on these deposits are a source of fee income, and a core deposit relationship provides the opportunity to cross-sell other financial products and services. The Corporation excludes time deposits in its definition of core deposits.\nCash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2016 totaled $0.472 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.032 or 7 percent above the cash dividends of $0.440, as adjusted, paid for the year 2015.\nThe Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend on December 13, 2016, the same common stock dividend percentage that was distributed in December 2015.\nAs a result of profitable operations and the public offering of common stock as previously reported on Form 8-Ks filed on December 15, 2015 and December 23, 2015, the Corporation's capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions. Table 9 - Capital Ratios, following, shows that both the Corporation and PeoplesBank were well capitalized for all periods presented.\nINCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS\nNet Interest Income\nThe Corporation's principal source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between (i) interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and (ii) interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds. Fluctuations in net interest income are caused by changes in both interest rates, and the volume and composition of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Unless otherwise noted, this section discusses interest income and interest expense amounts as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which are not presented on a tax equivalent basis.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $59,547,000, an increase of $5,966,000 or 11 percent above the full year 2016 net interest income. The increase was supported by a 12 percent increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets, primarily commercial loans. The additional interest income from the increased loan volume was partially offset by the costs associated with the growth in core deposits and an increase in volume and rates paid for both time deposits and long-term borrowings. The net interest margin, which reflects net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, was 3.84 percent for 2017, compared to 3.89 percent for 2016.\nInterest income for the full year 2017 totaled $70,415,000, an increase of $8,185,000 or 13 percent above 2016. The increase in total interest income was driven by a growth in the average volume of loans which was partially offset by a decrease in the average volume of investment securities. Interest earning assets averaged $1.57 billion and yielded 4.53 percent (tax equivalent basis) for 2017, compared to $1.40 billion and a tax-equivalent yield of 4.51 percent, respectively, for 2016.\nInterest expense for the full year 2017 totaled $10,868,000, an increase of $2,219,000 or 26 percent above 2016. The increase in total interest expense was primarily driven by an increase in volume and rate in core deposits (the Corporation defines core deposits as demand, savings, and money market deposits) and an increase in the rates paid on time deposits and long-term borrowings. Interest expense on deposits increased $1,471,000 or 22 percent for 2017 compared to 2016 and was primarily attributed to the increases in volume and rates paid on in interest bearing core deposits and time deposits. The average volume of interest bearing core deposits was $668,314,000 for the full year 2017, an $86,749,000 or 15 percent increase above the average volume for 2016. Interest expense on long-term debt increased $594,000 or 33 percent for 2017. The average rate paid on long-term borrowings in 2017 reflected a 1.83 percent increase from the average rate paid of 1.65 percent in 2016. Long-term debt is primarily comprised of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, with intermediate term bullet maturities that supplement deposit funding and provide a partial funding hedge against rising market interest rates.\nTables 1 and 2, following, are presented on a tax-equivalent basis to make it easier to compare taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest on tax-exempt assets (which include securities issued by, or loans made to, state and local governments) is adjusted based upon a 35 percent federal income tax rate in 2017 compared to a 34 percent rate for 2016 and 2015.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>Table 1-Average Balances and Interest Rates (tax equivalent basis) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

allocated in proportion to their relationship to the amount of change attributed directly to volume or rate.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is an expense charged to earnings to cover estimated losses attributable to uncollectable loans. The provision reflects management's judgment of an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses. The Risk Management section of this report, including Table 10 - Nonperforming Assets, Table 11 - Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses, and Table 12 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, provides detailed information about the allowance for loan losses, the loan loss provision, and credit risk.\nFor the year 2017, the provision for loan losses was $4,175,000, which was $1,175,000 or 39 percent higher, compared to a provision of $3,000,000 in 2016. The increased provision for loan losses was impacted by an increase in net charge-offs in 2017 of $1,766,000. One loan in the construction and land development portfolio was primary the contributor to the increase in net charge-offs. The provision for both periods supported adequate allowance for loan loss coverage, including the Corporation's substantial growth in commercial loans, and the Corporation's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents the components of total noninterest income for each of the past three years.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>Table 3 - Noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Trust and investment services fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,411 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>810 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Service charges on deposit accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,406 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from bank owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>567 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net gain on sales of loans held for sale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>667 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sales of securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>492 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,047 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year 2017, the overall $1,492,000 or 15 percent increase in total noninterest income, compared to the year 2016, was primarily the result of increases in trust fees, service charges on deposit, income from bank owned life insurance, and gains on sales of loans held for sale. The discussion that follows addresses changes in selected categories of noninterest income.\nTrust and investment services fees-The upward trend in trust and investment services fee income over the three year period presented was due to growth in trust assets under management from both new accounts, and appreciation in the market value of managed accounts, upon which some fees are based.\nIncome from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales- Income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales declined during the current year due to the implementation of a new regulatory rule resulting in reduced commissions. Despite the reduced fees in the current year, assets under management have shown a steady increase over the last three year period. The non-deposit investment products are sold by PeoplesBank's subsidiaries Codorus Valley Financial Advisors, Inc. d/b/a PeoplesWealth Advisors.\nService charges on deposit accounts-For the year 2017, the $468,000 or 13 percent increase in service charge income compared to the year 2016 was due to an increase in the volume of demand deposit accounts subject to fees and debit card transactions. For the year 2016, service charge income increased $290,000 or 9 percent as compared to the year 2015.\nIncome from bank owned life insurance (BOLI)-For the year 2017, the $167,000 or 19 percent increase in income from BOLI compared to 2016 was primarily due to additional investments totaling $4,007,000 during 2017. For the year 2016, the $167,000 or 24 percent increase in income from BOLI compared to 2015 was primarily due to additional investments totaling $6,987,000 during 2016.\nNet gain on sales of loans held for sale-The upward trend in net gains from the sale of loans held for sale is primarily due to a favorable trend in sales of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and selling the guaranteed portion of secondary-market qualified loans originated through programs with the Small Business Administration.\nNet gain on sales of securities-For the year 2017, the Corporation realized $79,000 in gains on sales of securities compared to $194,000 and $492,000 for the full years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Securities sold included those where market pricing for certain instruments provided a favorable total return upon the sales and reinvestment of proceeds, versus holding the respective securities to maturity. In addition, sales provided cash to meet short-term liquidity needs.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of total noninterest expense for each of the past three years.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>Table 4 - Noninterest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Personnel </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,317 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Occupancy of premises, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Furniture and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Postage, stationery and supplies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional and legal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>896 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FDIC insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>712 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debit card processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Charitable donations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>986 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Telecommunications </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>702 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>External data processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,154 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Merger related </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>474 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Foreclosed real estate including (recovery of) provision for losses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(422 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,885 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,427 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal noninterest expense for the year 2017 increased $3,363,000 or 8 percent above the year 2016, reflecting the overall expansion of our business and consumer banking in and support services for our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets. The discussion that follows addresses changes in selected noninterest expenses.\nPersonnel-The upward trend in personnel expense was due largely to an increase in wage and benefit costs resulting from planned staff additions to support our expanded business and consumer banking services in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Also contributing to the increase is a higher cost of health insurance.\nOccupancy of premises, net- Occupancy of premises expense is comprised of rent, depreciation, maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes and utilities. The level of expense can vary annually based upon franchise expansion, repairs and maintenance, and normal business growth.\nFurniture and equipment-The upward trend in furniture and equipment expense was in alignment with the increased personnel expense, as additional furniture, computer hardware and software (and related depreciation and maintenance expenses) were incurred to support staff growth. During 2017, overall maintenance and repair expenses declined compared to 2016 offsetting some of the aforementioned increases in expenses.\nPostage, stationary and supplies-The level of postage, stationary and supplies can vary based on growth in loan and deposit customers, franchise expansion, postage rate changes, and marketing promotions.\nProfessional and legal-The level of professional and legal expense can fluctuate annually based on the varying needs for legal, accounting and consulting services, which is driven in part by the level of routine lawsuits in the ordinary course of business and the number and complexity of corporate initiatives.\nMarketing- The upward trend in marketing expense reflects an increased operating budget to support normal business growth, and corporate initiatives such as branding, product advertising and internal promotions. In 2016, marketing expense included initial costs associated with the acquisition of the naming rights to PeoplesBank Park, the facility that houses the York, Pennsylvania-based York Revolution, an independent league baseball team.\nFDIC insurance-FDIC insurance fluctuations are a result of growth in assets and changes in financial ratios and other factors which are used to calculate the assessment multiplier. The change for 2016 as compared to 2015 was a result of a change in the assessment methodology effective with the third quarter 2016 and a lower assessment rate.\nDebit card processing-The upward trend in debit card processing reflects a continual increase in debit card transaction volume, due primarily to the increased number of demand deposit accounts and debit cards offset in the current year by a new contract which reduced the costs per transaction.\nCharitable donations-The level of charitable donations can fluctuate annually due to the timing of payment and the availability of the state tax credits. Some donations to nonprofit organizations qualify for related state tax credits that typically range from 50 to 90 percent of the amount donated, effectively lowering the cost of the donation. PeoplesBank uses state tax credits from donations to reduce its Pennsylvania bank shares tax expense which is included in other expenses as well as Maryland corporate income tax.\nTelecommunications- The upward trend was due primarily to the increases in network capacity, the number of facilities, and personnel.\nExternal data processing-The upward trend in external data processing reflects increased reliance on outsourcing transaction processing to specialized vendors, which is typically performed on their hosted and secure websites, thereby increasing the Corporation's data processing efficiency. Additional expenditures related to expansion in the electronic banking services offered to our client base, and charges for higher transaction volume from normal business growth.\nMerger related- The $474,000 in 2015 of merger related expenses were associated with the Corporation's acquisition of Madison Bancorp, Inc. (the acquisition was completed on January 16, 2015, as disclosed on a Form 8-K filed on the same date). In 2015, acquisition-related expenses included external data processing conversion costs, severance payments, acquisition accounting services and legal expenses.\nForeclosed real estate including (recovery of) provision for losses- A downward trend in the volume of foreclosed assets held resulted in a reduction in year-over-year holding costs including real estate taxes, property maintenance, appraisal fees, and provision for losses. In addition, during 2017, there was a recovery of a prior provision. The $579,000 or 369 percent increase in foreclosed real estate expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily a result of 2015 including a partial recovery of a previous valuation allowance of $746,000 on a large foreclosed real estate property.\nOther expenses -Other expense, comprised of many underlying expenses, increased $704,000 or 21 percent in 2017 as compared to 2016 reflecting additional costs associated with director and committee fees, miscellaneous loan expenses, memberships, Pennsylvania bank shares tax, deposit charge-offs and impaired loans. In 2016, other expenses increased $392,000 or 14 percent as compared to 2015 reflecting additional costs associated with the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities' annual assessment, annual shareholder meeting, Pennsylvania bank shares tax and impaired loans.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $9,904,000, which was $4,018,000 or 68 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2016 of $5,886,000. The increase was due to a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $2,920,000 increase in pre-tax net income. For both years, the Corporation's incremental statutory federal income tax rate was 35 percent; however, the Corporation's effective income tax rate was approximately 45 percent for 2017, compared to 31 percent for 2016. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to the impact and volume of tax-exempt income, including income from bank owned life insurance and certain municipal securities and loans and the new corporate tax rate.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nNo preferred stock dividends were paid in 2017 as compared to $16,000 for 2016. Preferred stock dividends for 2016 were $16,000, a decrease of $104,000 compared to $120,000 of preferred stock dividends in 2015. On February 18, 2016, as reported on a Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016, the Corporation redeemed the remaining $12,000,000 in outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock issued under the U.S. Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program, resulting in the reduction in dividends expense for the year. Information about the SBLF Program is provided in Note 10-Shareholders' Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. The preferred stock dividend rate for both 2016 and 2015 was 1 percent of the amount of the average preferred stock outstanding, paid quarterly to the U.S. Treasury.\nBALANCE SHEET REVIEW\nInterest Bearing Deposits with Banks\nInterest bearing deposits with banks totaled $55,566,000 on December 31, 2017, compared to $54,966,000 on December 31, 2016. The balance remained relatively flat as a result of the strong growth in deposits and cash flow from the investment portfolio offset by loan growth, principally commercial loans.\nInvestment Securities (Available-for-Sale)\nThe Corporation's entire investment securities portfolio is classified available-for-sale, and is comprised of interest-earning debt securities (see Table 5 below). Investment securities serve as an important source of liquidity, and provide stable interest income revenue supplementary to the larger loan portfolio. The securities also serve as collateral for public and trust deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and to support borrowing capacity. The investment securities portfolio is managed to comply with the Corporation's Investment Securities Policy, and accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320. Decisions to purchase or sell securities are based on an assessment of current economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment, the demand for loans, liquidity and income requirements.\nThe following table shows the amortized cost and fair value, by type of debt security, for three year-end periods:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>Table 5-Investment Securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Value </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debt securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. Treasury notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. agency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,414 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. agency mortgage-backed, residential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State and municipal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,475 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total debt securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017, the fair value of securities, available-for-sale, totaled $158,591,000, a decrease compared to the fair value of the investment securities portfolio balance of $194,739,000 at December 31, 2016. For the year 2017, cash inflows from maturities, repayments, and calls were reinvested in commercial loans and paid off short term borrowings. Additionally, approximately $5,613,000 of securities were sold during 2017 to realize $79,000 of gains to meet short-term liquidity needs.\nSecurities available-for-sale are generally comprised of high quality debt instruments. On January 1, 2013, Section 939(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective changing the definition of investment grade by removing reliance on credit ratings by national statistical rating organizations. Investment credit assessment, under the revised definition, requires an active review by the Corporation (i.e., pre-purchase and post-purchase credit risk analysis) of the underlying obligor to determine that the obligor has an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments, and more specifically, that the risk of default is low, and that full and timely repayment of principal and interest is expected. Obligations of the U.S. government and U.S. government sponsored enterprises are not subject to the due diligence requirement. However, the Corporation's municipal securities, and any corporate securities that may be acquired in the future, are subject to the new requirement.\nAs shown in Table 5, above, the Corporation holds investments in the obligations of states and municipalities. Municipalities have many options for meeting their debt obligations, including decreasing costs and service levels, imposing taxes and fees and selling assets. In many cases, municipal debt issues are insured or, in the case of school districts of selected states, backed by specific reserves, which provide additional layers of protection to the investor. Access to the credit market and a good credit rating are high priorities enabling a municipality to meet its current and future funding needs at a reasonable interest cost. For these reasons, defaults on municipal bonds are unusual. The majority of municipal bonds in the Corporation's portfolio are general obligation bonds, which can draw upon multiple sources of revenue, including taxes, for payment. Only a few bonds are revenue bonds, which are dependent upon a single revenue stream for payment, but such bonds are for critical services such as water and sewer. Many of the municipal holdings are also insured or backed by specific school district loss reserves. Based on the results of an independent credit review of the Bank's entire municipal bond portfolio as performed in 2017, and recent bond ratings by national statistical rating organizations, we believe that the municipal investments held by PeoplesBank are investment grade.\nThe table below shows that the available-for-sale securities portfolio had an overall yield of 2.44 percent on December 31, 2017:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>Table 6-Securities Maturity Schedule (amortized cost basis) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Distribution </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Five </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>through </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>through </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>or less </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ten years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ten years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Yield(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Treasury notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.68 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. agency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.84 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. agency mortgage-backed, residential (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.41 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and municipal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.91 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.44 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Yield (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.34 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Weighted average yields (tax equivalent basis) were calculated on the amortized cost basis. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities are included in the maturity categories based on average expected life. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe portfolio yield as of December 31, 2017, reflected in the table above, is lower than the 2.51 percent securities portfolio yield as of December 31, 2016. Generally, lower yielding securities, as compared to the yields in maturing and called securities, were purchased in 2017. Purchases included the reinvestment of cash flows from maturities, calls and principal repayments on mortgage-backed bonds, during a year of low market investment interest rates. More information about investment securities is provided in Note 3-Securities, to the consolidated financial statements.\nRestricted Investment in Bank Stocks\nAt December 31, 2017, the Corporation held approximately $6,311,000 in restricted common stock, compared to $6,926,000 at year-end 2016. Investment in restricted stock is a condition of obtaining credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLBP) and the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank, which is a subsidiary of Atlantic Community Bancshares, Inc. (ACBI). Accordingly, changes in the level of restricted stock are the result of member capital requirements and borrowing levels from the FHLBP as described within the Long-term Debt section of this report. Of the total investment as of December 31, 2017, approximately $6,236,000 consisted of stock issued by the FHLBP, with the remainder being restricted stock issued by ACBI. Information about restricted investment in bank stocks, including impairment considerations, is provided in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held for Sale\nOn December 31, 2017, loans held for sale were approximately $1,715,000, compared to $1,548,000 at year-end 2016. The $1,715,000 consists of $1,062,000 residential mortgage loans and $653,000 of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. For both years, PeoplesBank's mortgage banking production focused on originating and selling secondary-market qualifying residential mortgage loans. Beginning in January 2016, PeoplesBank retained mortgage servicing rights on residential mortgage loans sold on the secondary market. In addition, in 2016, PeoplesBank began originating loans partially guaranteed by the Small Business Administration with the intent to sell the guaranteed portion of secondary-market qualifying loans.\nLoans\nOn December 31, 2017, total loans, net of deferred fees, totaled approximately $1.40 billion, compared to $1.27 billion at year end 2016, an increase of $128,993,000 or 10 percent above total loans as of year-end 2016. Most of the increase was due to a $124,466,000 or 12 percent increase in commercial loans, which reflected continued strong commercial loan demand in our markets, and our continued ability to expand existing relationships with creditworthy borrowers, and acquire new loan business, based on our reputation for client service and competitive prices and terms.\nThe average yield (tax-equivalent basis) earned on total loans was 4.90 percent for the full year 2017, as compared to 4.93 percent for the year 2016. Persistent low market interest rates and strong competition in our markets resulted in continuing pricing pressures on new loan and refinancing activities. The composition of the Corporation's loan portfolio, by industry class, at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is provided in Note 4-Loans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents the general composition of total loans for five year-end periods:\nTable 7-Loan Portfolio Composition\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,013,428 </td> <td>72.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>924,729 </td> <td>72.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>802,436 </td> <td>71.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>658,627 </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>607,779 </td> <td>70.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate-construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,402 </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,635 </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,978 </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,695 </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,436 </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commercial related loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,197,830 </td> <td>85.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,073,364 </td> <td>84.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>936,414 </td> <td>83.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>773,322 </td> <td>84.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>714,215 </td> <td>83.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate - residential mortgages </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,325 </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,496 </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,094 </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,453 </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,695 </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer and home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122,609 </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,911 </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,703 </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,315 </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,474 </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consumer related loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>201,934 </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197,407 </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186,797 </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,768 </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,169 </td> <td>16.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,399,764 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,270,771 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,123,211 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>920,090 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>859,384 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below shows at December 31, 2017, the commercial loan portfolio was comprised of approximately $822,285,000 or 69 percent in fixed rate loans, and $375,545,000 or 31 percent in floating rate loans. This compares to $768,149,000 or 72 percent in fixed rate loans, and $305,215,000 or 28 percent in floating rate loans, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Floating rate loans reprice periodically with changes in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Prime Rate, or LIBOR.\nTable 8-Selected Loan Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017\nMaturity Distribution\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>through </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>or less </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>612,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,013,428 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate-construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,402 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commercial related loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>298,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>649,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,197,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fixed interest rates </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>210,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>569,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>822,285 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Floating interest rates </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375,545 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commercial related loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>298,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>649,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,197,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, in terms of dollars and percentages more floating rate commercial loans were originated although a majority of the commercial portfolio is fixed rate loans with maturities ranging from five to ten years. Although the commercial loan portfolio's fixed rate volume and longer maturities increase risk if interest rates rise, management has implemented interest rate risk mitigation strategies which include maintaining a shorter duration in the Corporation's investment portfolio, and lengthening fixed rate liabilities, principally borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. In addition, commercial loans are generally structured whereby there is an initial fixed rate period, typically five years, and then adjust based upon a predetermined index if a new fixed rate is not renegotiated. Approximately 47 percent of the loans identified as fixed interest rates above are set to adjust during the term of the loan. Additional loan information can be found in Note 4-Loans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and within the Risk Management section of this report.\nPremises and Equipment\nOn December 31, 2017, premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled approximately $24,382,000, as compared to $24,573,000 on December 31, 2016. The decrease was a result of depreciation and disposals on existing premises and equipment of $2,348,000 exceeding new acquisitions of $2,157,000.\nOther Assets\nOn December 31, 2017, other assets totaled approximately $53,306,000, compared to $51,689,000 of other assets as of December 31, 2016. Other assets were primarily comprised of investments in bank owned life insurance (BOLI), foreclosed real estate, accrued interest receivable, and deferred tax assets.\nInvestments in life insurance relates to a select group of employees and directors whereby PeoplesBank is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. These investments, carried at the cash surrender value of the underlying policies, totaled $36,632,000 at year-end 2017, compared to $31,621,000 at year-end 2016. PeoplesBank purchased $4,007,000 of BOLI during 2017. The selection of the underlying BOLI insurers is based primarily on the respective insurers' high credit rating and reputation, and competitive tax-exempt yield. The Corporation also seeks to maintain a reasonable diversification among insurers supporting the BOLI portfolio. The level of the Corporation's BOLI investment was approximately 22 percent of PeoplesBank's Tier 1 capital, excluding net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, at December 31, 2017, which is within the regulatory guideline of 25 percent of Tier 1 capital.\nOther assets also include foreclosed real estate, net of allowance, totaling $216,000 at year-end 2017, compared to $2,705,000 at year-end 2016. The $2,489,000 decrease was primarily the result of sale of all of the properties held at December 31, 2016 during 2017. Foreclosed real estate is discussed in the Nonperforming Assets section of this report.\nAlso included with other assets is $4,968,000 of accrued interest receivable on loans and investment securities, and $4,715,000 of net deferred tax assets. Net deferred assets declined year over year primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduced the corporate Federal tax rate to 21 percent. Additional information about these assets can be found in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under the appropriate subheadings.\nFunding\nDeposits\nDeposits are the Corporation's principal source of funding for earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 0.74 percent for the year 2017 as compared to 0.67 percent for the year 2016.\nOn December 31, 2017, deposits totaled $1.38 billion, which represented a $120,330,000 or 10 percent increase compared to the level at year-end 2016. The increase in all deposit categories, primarily money market and time deposits, reflects several rate promotions offered throughout the year. Core deposits, consisting of demand, money market and savings, in aggregate, increased $100,994,000 or 12 percent and time deposits (i.e. CDs) increased $19,336,000 or 5 percent. Of the total $446,021,000 of time deposits as of December 31, 2017, the balance of certificates of deposit with a balance of less than $100,000 totaled $260,482,000, $100,000 to $250,000 totaled $135,242,000 and $250,000 or more totaled $50,297,000. Time deposits totaling $190,146,000 or 43 percent of the total at year-end 2017 will mature in 2018.\nOn December 31, 2017, the balance of certificates of deposit with a balance of $100,000 and above was $185,539,000. Of this total, $28,246,000 mature within three months, $17,961,000 mature after three months but within six months, $33,417,000 mature after six months but within twelve months, and the remaining $105,915,000 mature beyond twelve months. The composition of the Corporation's deposit portfolio at December 31, 2017 is provided in Note 7-Deposits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nShort-term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repo agreements), federal funds purchased, and other borrowings as described more fully in Note 8-Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt, to the consolidated financial statements. On December 31, 2017, short-term borrowings totaled $20,495,000, as compared to the $56,637,000 as of December 31, 2016. The balance on December 31, 2017, consisted of $10,295,000 of repurchase agreements and $10,200,000 of other short-term borrowings as compared to the balance of $56,637,000 at year-end 2016 consisting of $23,637,000 of repurchase agreements and $33,000,000 of short-term borrowings. The decrease in the balance of repurchase agreements was a result of a move in balances into deposit products while other short-term borrowings declined as cash flow from investments and deposits were ample to fund loan growth and maintain adequate liquidity.\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt is a secondary funding source to deposits for asset growth. On December 31, 2017, long-term debt totaled $130,310,000, compared to $125,310,000 at year-end 2016. The increase was the result of $5,000,000 in net new advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLBP).\nGenerally, funds for the payment of long-term debt come from operations. On December 31, 2017, total unused credit with the FHLBP was approximately $346,889,000. Obligations to the FHLBP are secured by FHLBP stock and qualifying collateral, principally real estate secured loans. A listing of outstanding long-term debt obligations is provided in Note 8-Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nShareholders' Equity and Capital Adequacy\nShareholders' equity, or capital, enables the Corporation to maintain asset growth and absorb losses. Capital adequacy can be affected by a multitude of factors, including profitability, new stock issuances, corporate expansion, balance sheet growth, dividend policy, and regulatory mandates.\nTotal shareholders' equity was $164,219,000 on December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $9,262,000 or 6 percent, compared to $154,957,000 at year-end 2016. The increase was primarily the result the Corporation's $12,004,000 in net income available for common shareholders less $4,559,000 of dividends paid to common shareholders for 2017. Information pertaining to preferred and common stock of the Corporation is disclosed in Note 10-Shareholders' Equity, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nRedemption of Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends\nAs previously disclosed, the Corporation participated in the U.S. Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Small Business Lending Fund Program (SBLF Program). Information about the SBLF Program is provided in Note 10-Shareholders' Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. Under the SBLF program, the Corporation originally issued $25,000,000, or 25,000 shares of non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock, Series B, $1,000 liquidation value, $2.50 par value to the Treasury.\nThe SBLF preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 regulatory capital and requires the payment of non-cumulative cash dividends quarterly on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. Preferred stock dividends for 2016 were $16,000, a decrease of $104,000 compared to $120,000 of preferred stock dividends in 2015. On February 18, 2016, Codorus Valley redeemed the remaining $12,000,000, or 12,000 shares of Series B preferred stock issued to the Treasury as reported on form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016. The annualized dividend rate on the preferred stock issued under the SBLF Program was 1 percent through the redemption date of February 18, 2016.\nDividends on Common Stock\nThe Corporation typically pays cash dividends on its common stock on a quarterly basis. The Board of Directors determines the dividend rate after considering the Corporation's capital requirements, current and projected net income, and other factors. Annual cash dividends per common share for the year 2017 totaled $0.516 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.044 or 9 percent above the cash dividends of $0.472, as adjusted, paid for the year 2016.\nPeriodically, the Corporation distributes stock dividends on its common stock. On December 12, 2017, the Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 24, 2017. A 5 percent common stock dividend was also distributed in December 2016.\nCompensation Plans\nAs disclosed in this report, the Corporation maintains various employee and director benefit plans that could result in the issuance of its common stock or affect its earnings. Information regarding these plans can be found in Note 11-Benefit Plans and Note 12-Stock-Based Compensation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nCapital Ratios\nThe Corporation and PeoplesBank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators that involve quantitative guidelines and qualitative judgments. Quantitative measures established by regulators pertain to minimum capital ratios, as set forth in Table 9 below. The table provides a comparison of the Corporation's and PeoplesBank's risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios to the minimum regulatory requirement for the periods indicated.\nTable 9-Capital Ratios\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratios </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Federal Minimum </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Federal </td> <td> </td> <td>Capital (2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>at December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Required (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Well </td> <td> </td> <td>at December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Capitalized </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common Equity Tier 1 Capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(as a percentage of risk weighted assets) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc.

Under the rule, minimum requirements will increase both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. Consistent with the Basel III framework, the rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent, and a common equity Tier 1 conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, that will apply to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4 percent to 6 percent, and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent for all banking organizations. The new rule also increases the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors. The rule for smaller, less complex institutions, including the Corporation and PeoplesBank, became effective January 1, 2015.\nThe new rule provides that, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer, which is to be phased in over a four year period beginning January 1, 2016, with the full 2.5 percent required as of January 1, 2019.\nThe transition schedule for new ratios, including the capital conservation buffer, is as follows:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>As of January 1:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td>2016 </td> <td>2017 </td> <td>2018 </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>4.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>0.625% </td> <td>1.25% </td> <td>1.875% </td> <td>2.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>5.125% </td> <td>5.75% </td> <td>6.375% </td> <td>7.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Phase-in of most deductions from common equity Tier 1 capital </td> <td>40% </td> <td>60% </td> <td>80% </td> <td>100% </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum Tier 1 capital ratio </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td>6.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum Tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>6.625% </td> <td>7.25% </td> <td>7.875% </td> <td>8.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum total capital ratio </td> <td>8.0% </td> <td>8.0% </td> <td>8.0% </td> <td>8.0% </td> <td>8.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum total capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>8.625% </td> <td>9.25% </td> <td>9.875% </td> <td>10.5% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs fully phased in, a banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5 percent would not be subject to limits on dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer less than 2.5 percent would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The new rule also prohibits a banking organization from making dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 percent as of the beginning of that quarter. Eligible net income is defined as net income for the 4 calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. A summary of payout restrictions based on the capital conservation buffer is as follows:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>Capital Conservation Buffer\n(as a % of risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td>Maximum Payout\n(as a % of eligible retained income)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Greater than 2.5% </td> <td>No payout limitation applies </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u22642.5% and >1.875% </td> <td>60% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u22641.875% and >1.25% </td> <td>40% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u22641.25% and >0.625% </td> <td>20% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u22640.625% </td> <td>0% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporation's regulatory capital position at December 31, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in Table 9 above, reflects compliance with the new rule requirements that became effective January 1, 2015. The Corporation plans to manage its capital to ensure continued compliance.\nRisk Management\nThe Corporation's Enterprise Risk Management Committee ( Committee\u201d) meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and at least one independent director. The objective of the Committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the Corporation and its affiliates. While the Committee's risk review is broad in scope, its primary responsibility is to develop, implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures.\nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the possibility that a loan client, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms, posing one of the most significant risks of loss to the Corporation. Accordingly, the Corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk. To support this objective, a lending policy framework has been established which management believes is sound given the nature and scope of our operations. This framework includes seven basic policy parameters that guide the lending process and minimize risk:\nTable 100: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The Corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount, loan type, level of risk, and loan officer experience. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the Board level to review and approve loans that exceed pre-established dollar thresholds and/or meet other criteria. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The Corporation lends mainly within its primary geographical market area, including York County, Cumberland County, and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and Harford County, Baltimore County, Baltimore City and Carroll County, Maryland. Although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk, the diverse local economies and employee knowledge of our clients lessens this risk. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single client or small group of related clients. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The Corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market, nor does it invest in securities backed by subprime mortgages. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The Corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporation uses loan-to-value ratios ( LTV ratios\u201d) for loan underwriting, establishing generally acceptable ratios of the loan amount to the value of the collateral securing the loan, to minimize the risk of future loss from the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017, the LTV ratios listed below were in effect.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>LTV ratio % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Owner </td> <td>Non-owner </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan type </td> <td> </td> <td>Occupied </td> <td>Occupied </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential, owner occupied 1-4 units, tax assessment (PA) </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td>80 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential, owner occupied 1-4 units, tax assessment (MD) </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td>90 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential, owner occupied 1-4 units, certified appraisal </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>75 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential construction - spec </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>70 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential construction - presold </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>80 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential rehab for resale </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>70 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>75 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential (5 or more units) </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td>75 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>75 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Raw Land </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td>60 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Approved, but unimproved land </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>65 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Approved and improved land </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>70 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>65 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Hotels/motels and mobile home parks </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>65 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Special/Limited use properties </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td>50 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn acceptable valuation is required on all real estate secured loans. Generally, an appraisal performed by an independent licensed appraiser is required for real estate secured loans under any of the following conditions:\nTable 108: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>loan amount is above $250,000; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>or if the LTV is above 75 percent for commercial non-owner occupied property; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>or if the LTV is above 80 percent for commercial owner occupied property; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>or if the loan amount is greater than 90 percent of the tax assessed value for owner-occupied residential real estate in Pennsylvania; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>or if the loan amount is greater than 90 percent of the tax assessed value for owner-occupied residential real estate in Maryland; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>or if an existing appraisal is more than two years old (unless there was a material change in market conditions or the physical aspects of the property). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nExceptions to LTV ratios and the use of a licensed appraiser are sometimes made by management or the Board of Directors when there are compensating factors.\nOne component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations, defined as greater than 10 percent of the total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, the Corporation had three industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: commercial real estate investor represented 16.5 percent of the portfolio; residential real estate investor represented 15.0 percent of the portfolio; and builder and developer represented 13.2 percent of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had the same three industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: commercial real estate investor, which represented 19.2 percent of the portfolio; residential real estate investor, which represented 14.4 percent of the portfolio; and builder & developer, which represented 11.7 percent of the portfolio. Loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate.\nIn addition to a comprehensive lending policy, numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year. These portfolios, or selected accounts therein, are also examined periodically by the Corporation's or PeoplesBank's regulators.\nNonperforming Assets\nTable 10 - Nonperforming Assets, below, presents

reflects notable progress in reducing or maintaining the level of nonperforming assets. This has been accomplished through continuous collection efforts coordinated by the Corporation's General Counsel, recoveries from borrower payments and foreclosed real estate sales, the establishment of valuation allowances for selective accounts, and if necessary, loan charge-offs. In monitoring and managing nonperforming assets, we remain concerned about the impact of changing economic conditions, and the potential for adverse real estate market value changes, and the corresponding effects on commercial borrowers.\nNonperforming assets are reviewed by management on a monthly basis. We generally rely on appraisals performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of real estate collateral for impaired collateral-dependent loans. Generally, an appraisal is performed when: (i) an account reaches 90 days past due, unless a certified appraisal was completed within the past twelve months; (ii) market values have changed significantly; (iii) the condition of the property has changed significantly; or (iv) the existing appraisal is outdated based upon regulatory or policy requirements. In instances where the value of the collateral is less than the net carrying amount of the loan, a specific loss allowance is established for the difference by recording a loss provision to the income statement. When it is probable that some portion or all of the loan balance will not be collected, that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the nonperforming loan portfolio balance totaled $5,128,000, compared to $3,847,000 at year-end 2016. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due. The Corporation generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest income (i.e., recognizes interest income on a cash basis as long as the loan is sufficiently collateralized) when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due 90 days or more. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest represent loans that are contractually past due, but are well collateralized and in the process of collection. A loan is returned to interest accruing status when we determine that circumstances have improved to the extent that all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are current for at least six consecutive payments and future payments are reasonably assured. As of December 31, 2017, the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance totaled $5,052,000, compared to $3,114,000 at year-end 2016. The increase in nonaccrual loans resulted from reductions totaling $6,914,000 primarily principal repayments and charge-offs, which was offset by loans totaling $8,852,000 being placed on nonaccrual status. For both periods, the nonperforming loan portfolio balance was comprised primarily of collateralized commercial loans. For 2017, the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately $359,000. The amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for 2017 was approximately $164,000. The interest income recognized on impaired loans in Note 4-Loans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, is a higher amount because it includes interest income on all impaired loans, which includes nonaccrual loans, from the time the loan was impaired.\nForeclosed real estate represents real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to PeoplesBank and is included in the Other Assets category on the Corporation's balance sheet. The carrying amount of foreclosed real estate as of December 31, 2017, net of allowance, totaled $216,000, a decrease of $2,489,000 or 92 percent, compared to $2,705,000 at year-end 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of one property.\nTroubled debt restructurings pertain to loans whose terms have been modified to include a concession that we would not ordinarily consider due to the debtor's financial difficulties. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring typically involve a reduction of interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, the deferral of payments or extension of the stated maturity date. Troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment if they have been restructured during the most recent calendar year, or if they cease to perform in accordance with the modified terms. As of December 31, 2017, the accruing troubled debt restructuring portfolio balance totaled $3,344,000, compared to $3,664,000 at year-end 2016. The decrease was the result of principal payments made on loans within the troubled debt restructuring portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2017, there were $18,141,000 in additional potential problem loans being closely monitored by management. These additional potential problem loans consist of loans classified as substandard, reflecting an increased risk of the borrowers' ability to comply with present repayment terms. These loans are not classified as nonperforming and are not disclosed in Table 10. Comparatively, we were monitoring $11,979,000 of potential problem loans at December 31, 2016.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAlthough the Corporation believes that it maintains sound credit policies, certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. The allowance is based upon management's continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis, which is subject to review and approval by the Board. An overview of the methodology and key factors that we use in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance and loan impairment is provided in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists primarily of three components: (i) specific allowances for individually impaired commercial loans; (ii) allowances calculated for pools of loans; and (iii) an unallocated component, which reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the assumptions that underlie the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The Corporation uses an internal risk rating system to evaluate individual loans. Loans are segmented into industry groups or pools with similar characteristics, and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on quantitative factors such as recent loss history (two-year rolling average of net charge-offs) and qualitative factors, such as the results of internal and external credit reviews, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, adequacy of collateral, and general economic conditions. Determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is subjective, particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods, and requires that we make estimates using assumptions. There is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance as a result of regulatory examinations.\nAn analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five-year period is presented in Table 11 - Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses, below. A more detailed analysis of the allowance for the current year is provided in Note 5 -Allowance for Loan Losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $16,689,000 or 1.19 percent of total loans, on December 31, 2017, compared to $14,992,000 and 1.18 percent, respectively, on December 31, 2016. The $1,697,000 or 11 percent increase in the allowance from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, was generally consistent with the $128,993,000 or 10 percent overall increase in loan growth (primarily commercial loans), net of deferred fees, over the same 12 month period.\nBased on our comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, and recognizing other relevant considerations including expected continued loan growth, continued uncertainty on certain larger criticized assets as legal and collection efforts continue, and the unknown impact of future accounting and regulatory requirements related to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, we believe that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2017.\nTable 11 -Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance -

For example, we believe that we could face increasing credit risks and uncertainties, not yet reflected in current leading indicators, associated with prolonged low economic growth, or potential recessionary business conditions for certain industries or the broad economy, or the erosion of real estate values, any or all of which can adversely affect our borrowers' ability to service their loans.\nAdditionally, we have experienced continued strong commercial loan growth, including growth in newer markets where we have less of a loss history. Also, we recognize the inherent imprecision in any methodology for estimating specific and general loan losses, including the unpredictable timing and amounts of charge-offs and related historical loss averages, and specific-credit or broader portfolio future cash flow value and collateral valuation uncertainties which could negatively impact unimpaired portfolio loss factors. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, we maintained a 13 percent unallocated portion of our allowance for loan losses, similar to a 12 percent unallocated portion of the allowance as of December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity\nMaintaining adequate liquidity provides the Corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors, loan clients, employees, and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business. Additionally, it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise. Liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the Corporation's assets and liabilities. The primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows, funds received from client loan payments and, to a lesser degree, asset sales. The primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, included in this report, present the changes in cash from operating, investing and financing activities. At year-end 2017, we believe our liquidity was adequate based upon the potential liquidation of unpledged available-for-sale securities with a fair value totaling approximately $52,988,000 and available credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh totaling approximately $346,889,000. The Corporation's loan-to-deposit ratio was approximately 101 percent as of year-end 2017 and 2016. The ratio was flat as period end deposit growth was in line with loan growth in 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Corporation's financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. These commitments consist primarily of commitments to grant new loans, unfunded commitments under existing loan facilities, and letters of credit issued under the same standards as on-balance sheet instruments. Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk are disclosed in Note 14-Commitments to Extend Credit, to the consolidated financial statements, and totaled $508,575,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to $449,178,000 at December 31, 2016. Generally, these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes. Accordingly, many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and, therefore, generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the Corporation or PeoplesBank.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the amount and timing of payments due under long-term contractual obligations.\nTable 13-Contractual Obligations\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>446,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>675 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Supplemental retirement plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,454 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Naming rights </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>590,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>246,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,735 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity-to-assets ratio. Inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses, which tend to rise during periods of general inflation. The level of inflation can be measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers (December vs. December). The change in the CPI for 2017 and 2016 was 2.1 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for 2015.\nManagement believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the Corporation's ability to react to changes in market interest rates. Management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, management is focused on increasing fee income, an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the results of operations, capital resources and liquidity presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc. ( Codorus Valley\u201d or the Corporation\u201d), a bank holding company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, PeoplesBank, A Codorus Valley Company ( PeoplesBank\u201d), are provided below. Codorus Valley's consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist almost entirely of PeoplesBank's financial condition and results of operations. Current performance does not guarantee and may not be indicative of similar performance in the future.\nForward-looking Statements\nManagement of the Corporation has made forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements may be subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. When words such as believes,\u201d expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d or similar expressions are used in this Form 10-K, management is making forward-looking statements.\nNote that many factors, some of which are discussed elsewhere in this report and in the documents that are incorporated by reference, could affect the future financial results of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, both individually and collectively, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u25cf Operating, legal and regulatory risks; \n \u25cf Credit risk, including an increase in nonperforming assets requiring loss provisions and the incurrence of carrying costs related to nonperforming assets; \n \u25cf Interest rate fluctuations which could increase our cost of funds or decrease our yield on earning assets and therefore reduce our net interest income; \n \u25cf Declines in the market value of investment securities considered to be other-than-temporary; \n \u25cf Unavailability of capital when needed or availability at less than favorable terms; \n \u25cf Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise, may adversely affect the Corporation's operations, net income or reputation; \n \u25cf Inability to achieve merger-related synergies, and difficulties in integrating the business and operations of acquired institutions; \n \u25cf A prolonged economic downturn or excessive inflation; \n \u25cf Political and competitive forces affecting banking, securities, asset management and credit services businesses; \n \u25cf The effects of and changes in the rate of FDIC premiums, including special assessments; \n \u25cf Future legislative or administrative changes to U.S. governmental capital programs; \n \u25cf Future changes in federal or state tax laws or tax rates; \n \u25cf Enacted financial reform legislation, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, may have a significant impact on the Corporation's business and results of operations; and \n \u25cf The risk that management's analyses of these risks and forces could be incorrect and/or that the strategies developed to address them could be unsuccessful. \nThe Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nDisclosure of Codorus Valley's significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Some of these policies require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. Management makes significant estimates in determining the allowance for loan losses, valuation of foreclosed real estate, and evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment losses of securities.\nManagement considers a variety of factors in establishing allowance for loan losses such as current economic conditions, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews, financial and managerial strength of borrowers, adequacy of collateral, (if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows) and other relevant factors. There is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as a result of regulatory examinations.\nForeclosed real estate is initially recorded at fair value minus estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Appraisals are generally used to determine fair value. After foreclosure, management reviews valuations at least quarterly and adjusts the asset to the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell. Estimates related to the value of collateral can have a significant impact on whether or not management continues to accrue income on delinquent and impaired loans and on the amounts at which foreclosed real estate is recorded on the statement of financial condition.\nThe Corporation records its available-for-sale securities portfolio at fair value. Fair values for these securities are determined based on methodologies in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820. Fair values for debt securities are volatile and may be influenced by any number of factors, including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, credit ratings and yield curves. Fair values for debt securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security. When the fair value of a debt security is below its amortized cost and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost, additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment condition exists. Debt securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The analysis considers whether the Corporation has the intent to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity and whether it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity. Often, information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing, making estimates of fair value subject to judgment. If actual information or conditions are different than estimated, the extent of the impairment of the debt security may be different than previously estimated, which could have a material effect on the Corporation's results of operations and financial condition.\nManagement discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related Management Discussion and Analysis disclosures with the Audit Committee. There were no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented within this report. Additional information is contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis regarding critical accounting estimates, including the provision and allowance for loan losses located on pages 37 and 55 of this report.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nExecutive Summary\nThe Corporation's net income available to common shareholders (earnings) was $12,004,000 for the full year 2017, compared to $13,086,000 of earnings in 2016, a decrease of $1,082,000 or 8 percent. The decrease in net income and earnings per share for the year was primarily the result of a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n \u25cf Net interest income for 2017 increased $5,966,000 or 11 percent when compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the volume of commercial loans. \n \u25cf Net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis) for 2017 was 3.84 percent, compared to 3.89 percent for 2016. The Corporation continues to have success in growing lower cost core deposits, while maintaining reasonable yields on new loan growth in a highly competitive environment. The average yield on earning assets increased to 4.53 percent in 2017 as compared to 4.51 percent in 2016 and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.86 percent in 2017, as compared to 0.76 percent in 2016. \n \u25cf The loan loss provision for 2017 increased $1,175,000 compared to 2016, primary due to growth in commercial loans and an increase in net charge-offs in 2017 as compared to the prior year. \n \u25cf Noninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $11,443,000 representing an increase of $1,607,000 or 16 percent compared to noninterest income of $9,836,000 for 2016. Specific noninterest income increases included trust fees, service charges on deposits, income from bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of loans held for sale. Gains on sales of investment securities for 2017 decreased $115,000 when compared to 2016. \n \u25cf Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $44,986,000 representing an increase of $3,363,000 or 8 percent compared to $41,623,000 for 2016. Higher costs associated with: personnel, external data processing, charitable contributions and other expenses, accounted for the majority of the increase. The primary driver of the aforementioned increase in noninterest expense was the expansion of our business and consumer banking in and support services for our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets. \n \u25cf The provision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $9,904,000 which was $4,018,000 or 68 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2016 of $5,886,000. The increase was due to a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $2,920,000 increase in pre-tax net income. \n \u25cf Earnings per share were $1.35 basic and $1.34 diluted for 2017 compared to $1.49 basic and $1.48 diluted for 2016. The decrease in earnings per share for the year was primarily the result of the aforementioned reduction in the net deferred tax asset value. \nOn December 31, 2017, total assets were approximately $1.71 billion, representing a 6 percent increase compared to December 31, 2016. The growth for 2017 occurred primarily in the commercial loan portfolio and was funded primarily by an increase in deposits.\nThe Corporation's capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions.\nThe closing price for the Corporation's common stock (NASDAQ: CVLY) was $27.53 per share on December 31, 2017, compared to $27.24 per share on December 31, 2016, as adjusted. Cash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2017 totaled $0.516 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.044 or 9 percent above the cash dividends of $0.472, as adjusted, paid for the year 2016. Also, the Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend on December 12, 2017. The Selected Financial Data schedule, located on page 28 of this report, provides a summary of operations and performance metrics for the past five years in a comparative format.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe full year 2017, net income available to common shareholders of $12,004,000 represents a decrease of $1,082,000 compared to the full year 2016 earnings of $13,086,000. Earnings per share was $1.35 basic and $1.34 diluted for 2017 compared to $1.49 basic and $1.48 diluted for 2016. The decrease in net income and earnings per share for year was primarily the result of a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet interest income, which totaled $59,547,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, represented an increase of $5,966,000 or 11 percent above net interest income of $53,581,000 for 2016. The growth in net interest income reflects the increased volume of interest-earning assets, primarily commercial loans; however, the additional interest income from this new loan volume was partially offset by increased costs associated with the growth in core deposits and an increase in volume and rates paid for both time deposits and long-term borrowings.\nThe loan loss provision for 2017 totaled $4,175,000 as compared to the loan loss provision of $3,000,000 for 2016, an increase of $1,175,000. The increase in the provision was primarily a result of an increase in net charge-offs of $1,766,000 in 2017 compared to 2016 and commercial loan portfolio growth. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.19 percent and 1.18 percent as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increased allowance for loan losses reflected both the overall commercial loan growth for 2017, and the Corporation's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs.\nNoninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $11,443,000 representing an increase of $1,607,000 or 16 percent compared to noninterest income of $9,836,000 for 2016. Specific noninterest income increases included trust fees, service charges on deposits, income from bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of loans held for sale. Gains on sales of investment securities for 2017 decreased $115,000 when compared to 2016.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $44,986,000 representing an increase of $3,363,000 or 8 percent compared to $41,623,000 for 2016. Higher costs associated with: personnel, external data processing, charitable contributions and other expenses, accounted for the majority of the increase. The primary driver of the aforementioned increase in noninterest expense was the expansion of our business and consumer banking in and support services for our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $9,904,000 which was $4,018,000 or 68 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2016 of $5,886,000. The increase was due to a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $2,920,000 increase in pre-tax net income.\nOn December 31, 2017, total assets were $1.71 billion, representing an 6 percent increase compared to total assets of $1.61 billion as of December 31, 2016. Asset growth for 2017 occurred primarily in the commercial loan portfolio and was funded primarily by an increase in deposits.\nThe growth in core deposits included a $35,740,000 increase in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits for 2017 as compared to 2016. Growing core deposits remains a particular focus of the Corporation because the rates paid for such deposits are low, transactional activity on these deposits are a source of fee income, and a core deposit relationship provides the opportunity to cross-sell other financial products and services. The Corporation excludes time deposits in its definition of core deposits.\nCash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2017 totaled $0.516 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.044 or 9 percent above the cash dividends of $0.472, as adjusted, paid for the year 2016.\nThe Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend on December 12, 2017, the same common stock dividend percentage that was distributed in December 2016.\nThe Corporation's capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions. Table 9 - Capital Ratios, following, shows that both the Corporation and PeoplesBank were well capitalized for all periods presented.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe full year 2016 net income available to common shareholders of $13,086,000 represents an increase of $2,071,000 compared to the full year 2015 earnings of $11,015,000. Earnings per share was $1.49 basic and $1.48 diluted for 2016 compared to $1.60 basic and $1.59 diluted for 2015, as adjusted for stock dividends. The decrease is primarily a result of the issuance of 1,746,850 of common shares in the $34,500,000 public offering completed in December 2015. The Corporation used the funds from the public offering to redeem the remaining $12,000,000 of shares of Series B preferred stock issued under the U.S. Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program, as reported on a Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016. In addition, approximately $19,800,000 of the net proceeds were invested in the Corporation's Bank subsidiary PeoplesBank and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nNet interest income, which totaled $53,581,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, represented an increase of $5,753,000 or 12 percent above net interest income of $47,828,000 for 2015. The growth in net interest income reflects the increased volume of interest-earning assets, primarily commercial loans; however, the additional interest income from this new loan volume was partially offset by increased costs associated with the growth in core deposits and higher long-term borrowing costs.\nThe loan loss provision for 2016 totaled $3,000,000 as compared to the loan loss provision of $3,500,000 for 2015, a decrease of $500,000. The decrease in the provision was primarily a result of a reduction in net charge-offs of $1,246,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.18 percent and 1.13 percent as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increased allowance for loan losses reflected both the overall commercial loan growth for 2016, and the Corporation's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs.\nNoninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $9,836,000 representing an increase of $1,281,000 or 15 percent compared to noninterest income of $8,555,000 for 2015. Specific noninterest income increases included trust fees, income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales, service charges on deposits, income from bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of loans held for sale. Gains on sales of investment securities for 2016 decreased $298,000 when compared to 2015.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $41,623,000 representing an increase of $4,196,000 or 11 percent compared to $37,427,000 for 2015. Higher costs associated with: personnel, charitable donations, external data processing, debit card processing, FDIC insurance and other expenses, accounted for the majority of the increase. The primary driver of the aforementioned increase in noninterest expense was the expansion of our business and consumer banking services in our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2016 totaled $5,886,000 which was $1,073,000 or 22 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2015 of $4,813,000. The increase was due to higher pre-tax net income and a slight decrease in the amount of tax-exempt income.\nPreferred stock dividends for 2016 were $16,000, a decrease of $104,000, compared to $120,000 in 2015. The preferred stock dividend rate for both years was 1 percent. On February 18, 2016, as reported on a Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016, the Corporation redeemed the remaining $12,000,000 in outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock issued under the U.S. Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program, resulting in the reduction in dividends expense for the year.\nOn December 31, 2016, total assets were $1.61 billion, representing an 11 percent increase compared to total assets of $1.46 billion as of December 31, 2015. Asset growth for 2016 occurred primarily in the commercial loan portfolio and was funded primarily by an increase in deposits.\nThe growth in core deposits included a $37,694,000 increase in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits for 2016 as compared to 2015. Growing core deposits remains a particular focus of the Corporation because the rates paid for such deposits are low, transactional activity on these deposits are a source of fee income, and a core deposit relationship provides the opportunity to cross-sell other financial products and services. The Corporation excludes time deposits in its definition of core deposits.\nCash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2016 totaled $0.472 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.032 or 7 percent above the cash dividends of $0.440, as adjusted, paid for the year 2015.\nThe Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend on December 13, 2016, the same common stock dividend percentage that was distributed in December 2015.\nAs a result of profitable operations and the public offering of common stock as previously reported on Form 8-Ks filed on December 15, 2015 and December 23, 2015, the Corporation's capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions. Table 9 - Capital Ratios, following, shows that both the Corporation and PeoplesBank were well capitalized for all periods presented.\nINCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS\nNet Interest Income\nThe Corporation's principal source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between (i) interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and (ii) interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds. Fluctuations in net interest income are caused by changes in both interest rates, and the volume and composition of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Unless otherwise noted, this section discusses interest income and interest expense amounts as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which are not presented on a tax equivalent basis.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $59,547,000, an increase of $5,966,000 or 11 percent above the full year 2016 net interest income. The increase was supported by a 12 percent increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets, primarily commercial loans. The additional interest income from the increased loan volume was partially offset by the costs associated with the growth in core deposits and an increase in volume and rates paid for both time deposits and long-term borrowings. The net interest margin, which reflects net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, was 3.84 percent for 2017, compared to 3.89 percent for 2016.\nInterest income for the full year 2017 totaled $70,415,000, an increase of $8,185,000 or 13 percent above 2016. The increase in total interest income was driven by a growth in the average volume of loans which was partially offset by a decrease in the average volume of investment securities. Interest earning assets averaged $1.57 billion and yielded 4.53 percent (tax equivalent basis) for 2017, compared to $1.40 billion and a tax-equivalent yield of 4.51 percent, respectively, for 2016.\nInterest expense for the full year 2017 totaled $10,868,000, an increase of $2,219,000 or 26 percent above 2016. The increase in total interest expense was primarily driven by an increase in volume and rate in core deposits (the Corporation defines core deposits as demand, savings, and money market deposits) and an increase in the rates paid on time deposits and long-term borrowings. Interest expense on deposits increased $1,471,000 or 22 percent for 2017 compared to 2016 and was primarily attributed to the increases in volume and rates paid on in interest bearing core deposits and time deposits. The average volume of interest bearing core deposits was $668,314,000 for the full year 2017, an $86,749,000 or 15 percent increase above the average volume for 2016. Interest expense on long-term debt increased $594,000 or 33 percent for 2017. The average rate paid on long-term borrowings in 2017 reflected a 1.83 percent increase from the average rate paid of 1.65 percent in 2016. Long-term debt is primarily comprised of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, with intermediate term bullet maturities that supplement deposit funding and provide a partial funding hedge against rising market interest rates.\nTables 1 and 2, following, are presented on a tax-equivalent basis to make it easier to compare taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest on tax-exempt assets (which include securities issued by, or loans made to, state and local governments) is adjusted based upon a 35 percent federal income tax rate in 2017 compared to a 34 percent rate for 2016 and 2015.\n Table 1-Average Balances and Interest Rates (tax equivalent basis) \nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td>

volume and rate are allocated in proportion to their relationship to the amount of change attributed directly to volume or rate.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is an expense charged to earnings to cover estimated losses attributable to uncollectable loans. The provision reflects management's judgment of an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses. The Risk Management section of this report, including Table 10 - Nonperforming Assets, Table 11 - Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses, and Table 12 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, provides detailed information about the allowance for loan losses, the loan loss provision, and credit risk.\nFor the year 2017, the provision for loan losses was $4,175,000, which was $1,175,000 or 39 percent higher, compared to a provision of $3,000,000 in 2016. The increased provision for loan losses was impacted by an increase in net charge-offs in 2017 of $1,766,000. One loan in the construction and land development portfolio was primary the contributor to the increase in net charge-offs. The provision for both periods supported adequate allowance for loan loss coverage, including the Corporation's substantial growth in commercial loans, and the Corporation's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents the components of total noninterest income for each of the past three years.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>Table 3 - Noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Trust and investment services fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,411 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>810 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Service charges on deposit accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,406 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income from bank owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>567 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net gain on sales of loans held for sale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>667 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sales of securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>492 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,047 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year 2017, the overall $1,492,000 or 15 percent increase in total noninterest income, compared to the year 2016, was primarily the result of increases in trust fees, service charges on deposit, income from bank owned life insurance, and gains on sales of loans held for sale. The discussion that follows addresses changes in selected categories of noninterest income.\nTrust and investment services fees-The upward trend in trust and investment services fee income over the three year period presented was due to growth in trust assets under management from both new accounts, and appreciation in the market value of managed accounts, upon which some fees are based.\nIncome from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales- Income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales declined during the current year due to the implementation of a new regulatory rule resulting in reduced commissions. Despite the reduced fees in the current year, assets under management have shown a steady increase over the last three year period. The non-deposit investment products are sold by PeoplesBank's subsidiaries Codorus Valley Financial Advisors, Inc. d/b/a PeoplesWealth Advisors.\nService charges on deposit accounts-For the year 2017, the $468,000 or 13 percent increase in service charge income compared to the year 2016 was due to an increase in the volume of demand deposit accounts subject to fees and debit card transactions. For the year 2016, service charge income increased $290,000 or 9 percent as compared to the year 2015.\nIncome from bank owned life insurance (BOLI)-For the year 2017, the $167,000 or 19 percent increase in income from BOLI compared to 2016 was primarily due to additional investments totaling $4,007,000 during 2017. For the year 2016, the $167,000 or 24 percent increase in income from BOLI compared to 2015 was primarily due to additional investments totaling $6,987,000 during 2016.\nNet gain on sales of loans held for sale-The upward trend in net gains from the sale of loans held for sale is primarily due to a favorable trend in sales of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and selling the guaranteed portion of secondary-market qualified loans originated through programs with the Small Business Administration.\nNet gain on sales of securities-For the year 2017, the Corporation realized $79,000 in gains on sales of securities compared to $194,000 and $492,000 for the full years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Securities sold included those where market pricing for certain instruments provided a favorable total return upon the sales and reinvestment of proceeds, versus holding the respective securities to maturity. In addition, sales provided cash to meet short-term liquidity needs.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of total noninterest expense for each of the past three years.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>Table 4 - Noninterest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Personnel </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,317 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Occupancy of premises, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Furniture and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Postage, stationery and supplies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional and legal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>896 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FDIC insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>712 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debit card processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Charitable donations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>986 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Telecommunications </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>702 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>External data processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,154 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Merger related </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>474 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Foreclosed real estate including (recovery of) provision for losses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(422 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,885 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,427 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal noninterest expense for the year 2017 increased $3,363,000 or 8 percent above the year 2016, reflecting the overall expansion of our business and consumer banking in and support services for our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets. The discussion that follows addresses changes in selected noninterest expenses.\nPersonnel-The upward trend in personnel expense was due largely to an increase in wage and benefit costs resulting from planned staff additions to support our expanded business and consumer banking services in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Also contributing to the increase is a higher cost of health insurance.\nOccupancy of premises, net- Occupancy of premises expense is comprised of rent, depreciation, maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes and utilities. The level of expense can vary annually based upon franchise expansion, repairs and maintenance, and normal business growth.\nFurniture and equipment-The upward trend in furniture and equipment expense was in alignment with the increased personnel expense, as additional furniture, computer hardware and software (and related depreciation and maintenance expenses) were incurred to support staff growth. During 2017, overall maintenance and repair expenses declined compared to 2016 offsetting some of the aforementioned increases in expenses.\nPostage, stationary and supplies-The level of postage, stationary and supplies can vary based on growth in loan and deposit customers, franchise expansion, postage rate changes, and marketing promotions.\nProfessional and legal-The level of professional and legal expense can fluctuate annually based on the varying needs for legal, accounting and consulting services, which is driven in part by the level of routine lawsuits in the ordinary course of business and the number and complexity of corporate initiatives.\nMarketing- The upward trend in marketing expense reflects an increased operating budget to support normal business growth, and corporate initiatives such as branding, product advertising and internal promotions. In 2016, marketing expense included initial costs associated with the acquisition of the naming rights to PeoplesBank Park, the facility that houses the York, Pennsylvania-based York Revolution, an independent league baseball team.\nFDIC insurance-FDIC insurance fluctuations are a result of growth in assets and changes in financial ratios and other factors which are used to calculate the assessment multiplier. The change for 2016 as compared to 2015 was a result of a change in the assessment methodology effective with the third quarter 2016 and a lower assessment rate.\nDebit card processing-The upward trend in debit card processing reflects a continual increase in debit card transaction volume, due primarily to the increased number of demand deposit accounts and debit cards offset in the current year by a new contract which reduced the costs per transaction.\nCharitable donations-The level of charitable donations can fluctuate annually due to the timing of payment and the availability of the state tax credits. Some donations to nonprofit organizations qualify for related state tax credits that typically range from 50 to 90 percent of the amount donated, effectively lowering the cost of the donation. PeoplesBank uses state tax credits from donations to reduce its Pennsylvania bank shares tax expense which is included in other expenses as well as Maryland corporate income tax.\nTelecommunications- The upward trend was due primarily to the increases in network capacity, the number of facilities, and personnel.\nExternal data processing-The upward trend in external data processing reflects increased reliance on outsourcing transaction processing to specialized vendors, which is typically performed on their hosted and secure websites, thereby increasing the Corporation's data processing efficiency. Additional expenditures related to expansion in the electronic banking services offered to our client base, and charges for higher transaction volume from normal business growth.\nMerger related- The $474,000 in 2015 of merger related expenses were associated with the Corporation's acquisition of Madison Bancorp, Inc. (the acquisition was completed on January 16, 2015, as disclosed on a Form 8-K filed on the same date). In 2015, acquisition-related expenses included external data processing conversion costs, severance payments, acquisition accounting services and legal expenses.\nForeclosed real estate including (recovery of) provision for losses- A downward trend in the volume of foreclosed assets held resulted in a reduction in year-over-year holding costs including real estate taxes, property maintenance, appraisal fees, and provision for losses. In addition, during 2017, there was a recovery of a prior provision. The $579,000 or 369 percent increase in foreclosed real estate expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily a result of 2015 including a partial recovery of a previous valuation allowance of $746,000 on a large foreclosed real estate property.\nOther expenses -Other expense, comprised of many underlying expenses, increased $704,000 or 21 percent in 2017 as compared to 2016 reflecting additional costs associated with director and committee fees, miscellaneous loan expenses, memberships, Pennsylvania bank shares tax, deposit charge-offs and impaired loans. In 2016, other expenses increased $392,000 or 14 percent as compared to 2015 reflecting additional costs associated with the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities' annual assessment, annual shareholder meeting, Pennsylvania bank shares tax and impaired loans.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $9,904,000, which was $4,018,000 or 68 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2016 of $5,886,000. The increase was due to a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $2,920,000 increase in pre-tax net income. For both years, the Corporation's incremental statutory federal income tax rate was 35 percent; however, the Corporation's effective income tax rate was approximately 45 percent for 2017, compared to 31 percent for 2016. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to the impact and volume of tax-exempt income, including income from bank owned life insurance and certain municipal securities and loans and the new corporate tax rate.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nNo preferred stock dividends were paid in 2017 as compared to $16,000 for 2016. Preferred stock dividends for 2016 were $16,000, a decrease of $104,000 compared to $120,000 of preferred stock dividends in 2015. On February 18, 2016, as reported on a Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016, the Corporation redeemed the remaining $12,000,000 in outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock issued under the U.S. Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program, resulting in the reduction in dividends expense for the year. Information about the SBLF Program is provided in Note 10-Shareholders' Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. The preferred stock dividend rate for both 2016 and 2015 was 1 percent of the amount of the average preferred stock outstanding, paid quarterly to the U.S. Treasury.\nBALANCE SHEET REVIEW\nInterest Bearing Deposits with Banks\nInterest bearing deposits with banks totaled $55,566,000 on December 31, 2017, compared to $54,966,000 on December 31, 2016. The balance remained relatively flat as a result of the strong growth in deposits and cash flow from the investment portfolio offset by loan growth, principally commercial loans.\nInvestment Securities (Available-for-Sale)\nThe Corporation's entire investment securities portfolio is classified available-for-sale, and is comprised of interest-earning debt securities (see Table 5 below). Investment securities serve as an important source of liquidity, and provide stable interest income revenue supplementary to the larger loan portfolio. The securities also serve as collateral for public and trust deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and to support borrowing capacity. The investment securities portfolio is managed to comply with the Corporation's Investment Securities Policy, and accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320. Decisions to purchase or sell securities are based on an assessment of current economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment, the demand for loans, liquidity and income requirements.\nThe following table shows the amortized cost and fair value, by type of debt security, for three year-end periods:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>Table 5-Investment Securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amortized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Value </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debt securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. Treasury notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. agency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,414 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. agency mortgage-backed, residential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State and municipal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,475 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total debt securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017, the fair value of securities, available-for-sale, totaled $158,591,000, a decrease compared to the fair value of the investment securities portfolio balance of $194,739,000 at December 31, 2016. For the year 2017, cash inflows from maturities, repayments, and calls were reinvested in commercial loans and paid off short term borrowings. Additionally, approximately $5,613,000 of securities were sold during 2017 to realize $79,000 of gains to meet short-term liquidity needs.\nSecurities available-for-sale are generally comprised of high quality debt instruments. On January 1, 2013, Section 939(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective changing the definition of investment grade by removing reliance on credit ratings by national statistical rating organizations. Investment credit assessment, under the revised definition, requires an active review by the Corporation (i.e., pre-purchase and post-purchase credit risk analysis) of the underlying obligor to determine that the obligor has an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments, and more specifically, that the risk of default is low, and that full and timely repayment of principal and interest is expected. Obligations of the U.S. government and U.S. government sponsored enterprises are not subject to the due diligence requirement. However, the Corporation's municipal securities, and any corporate securities that may be acquired in the future, are subject to the new requirement.\nAs shown in Table 5, above, the Corporation holds investments in the obligations of states and municipalities. Municipalities have many options for meeting their debt obligations, including decreasing costs and service levels, imposing taxes and fees and selling assets. In many cases, municipal debt issues are insured or, in the case of school districts of selected states, backed by specific reserves, which provide additional layers of protection to the investor. Access to the credit market and a good credit rating are high priorities enabling a municipality to meet its current and future funding needs at a reasonable interest cost. For these reasons, defaults on municipal bonds are unusual. The majority of municipal bonds in the Corporation's portfolio are general obligation bonds, which can draw upon multiple sources of revenue, including taxes, for payment. Only a few bonds are revenue bonds, which are dependent upon a single revenue stream for payment, but such bonds are for critical services such as water and sewer. Many of the municipal holdings are also insured or backed by specific school district loss reserves. Based on the results of an independent credit review of the Bank's entire municipal bond portfolio as performed in 2017, and recent bond ratings by national statistical rating organizations, we believe that the municipal investments held by PeoplesBank are investment grade.\nThe table below shows that the available-for-sale securities portfolio had an overall yield of 2.44 percent on December 31, 2017:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>Table 6-Securities Maturity Schedule (amortized cost basis) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Distribution </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Five </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>through </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>through </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>or less </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ten years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ten years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Yield(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Treasury notes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.68 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. agency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.84 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. agency mortgage-backed, residential (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.41 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State and municipal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.91 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.44 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Yield (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.34 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Weighted average yields (tax equivalent basis) were calculated on the amortized cost basis. \n (2) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities are included in the maturity categories based on average expected life. \nThe portfolio yield as of December 31, 2017, reflected in the table above, is lower than the 2.51 percent securities portfolio yield as of December 31, 2016. Generally, lower yielding securities, as compared to the yields in maturing and called securities, were purchased in 2017. Purchases included the reinvestment of cash flows from maturities, calls and principal repayments on mortgage-backed bonds, during a year of low market investment interest rates. More information about investment securities is provided in Note 3-Securities, to the consolidated financial statements.\nRestricted Investment in Bank Stocks\nAt December 31, 2017, the Corporation held approximately $6,311,000 in restricted common stock, compared to $6,926,000 at year-end 2016. Investment in restricted stock is a condition of obtaining credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLBP) and the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank, which is a subsidiary of Atlantic Community Bancshares, Inc. (ACBI). Accordingly, changes in the level of restricted stock are the result of member capital requirements and borrowing levels from the FHLBP as described within the Long-term Debt section of this report. Of the total investment as of December 31, 2017, approximately $6,236,000 consisted of stock issued by the FHLBP, with the remainder being restricted stock issued by ACBI. Information about restricted investment in bank stocks, including impairment considerations, is provided in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held for Sale\nOn December 31, 2017, loans held for sale were approximately $1,715,000, compared to $1,548,000 at year-end 2016. The $1,715,000 consists of $1,062,000 residential mortgage loans and $653,000 of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. For both years, PeoplesBank's mortgage banking production focused on originating and selling secondary-market qualifying residential mortgage loans. Beginning in January 2016, PeoplesBank retained mortgage servicing rights on residential mortgage loans sold on the secondary market. In addition, in 2016, PeoplesBank began originating loans partially guaranteed by the Small Business Administration with the intent to sell the guaranteed portion of secondary-market qualifying loans.\nLoans\nOn December 31, 2017, total loans, net of deferred fees, totaled approximately $1.40 billion, compared to $1.27 billion at year end 2016, an increase of $128,993,000 or 10 percent above total loans as of year-end 2016. Most of the increase was due to a $124,466,000 or 12 percent increase in commercial loans, which reflected continued strong commercial loan demand in our markets, and our continued ability to expand existing relationships with creditworthy borrowers, and acquire new loan business, based on our reputation for client service and competitive prices and terms.\nThe average yield (tax-equivalent basis) earned on total loans was 4.90 percent for the full year 2017, as compared to 4.93 percent for the year 2016. Persistent low market interest rates and strong competition in our markets resulted in continuing pricing pressures on new loan and refinancing activities. The composition of the Corporation's loan portfolio, by industry class, at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is provided in Note 4-Loans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents the general composition of total loans for five year-end periods:\nTable 7-Loan Portfolio Composition\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,013,428 </td> <td>72.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>924,729 </td> <td>72.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>802,436 </td> <td>71.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>658,627 </td> <td>71.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>607,779 </td> <td>70.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate-construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,402 </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,635 </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,978 </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,695 </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,436 </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total commercial related loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,197,830 </td> <td>85.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,073,364 </td> <td>84.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>936,414 </td> <td>83.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>773,322 </td> <td>84.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>714,215 </td> <td>83.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate - residential mortgages </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,325 </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,496 </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,094 </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,453 </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,695 </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer and home equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122,609 </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,911 </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,703 </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,315 </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,474 </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consumer related loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>201,934 </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197,407 </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186,797 </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146,768 </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,169 </td> <td>16.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,399,764 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,270,771 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,123,211 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>920,090 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>859,384 </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below shows at December 31, 2017, the commercial loan portfolio was comprised of approximately $822,285,000 or 69 percent in fixed rate loans, and $375,545,000 or 31 percent in floating rate loans. This compares to $768,149,000 or 72 percent in fixed rate loans, and $305,215,000 or 28 percent in floating rate loans, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Floating rate loans reprice periodically with changes in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Prime Rate, or LIBOR.\nTable 8-Selected Loan Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017\nMaturity Distribution\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>through </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>or less </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>242,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>612,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,013,428 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate-construction and land development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,402 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commercial related loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>298,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>649,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,197,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fixed interest rates </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>210,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>569,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>822,285 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Floating interest rates </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>375,545 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commercial related loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>298,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>649,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,197,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, in terms of dollars and percentages more floating rate commercial loans were originated although a majority of the commercial portfolio is fixed rate loans with maturities ranging from five to ten years. Although the commercial loan portfolio's fixed rate volume and longer maturities increase risk if interest rates rise, management has implemented interest rate risk mitigation strategies which include maintaining a shorter duration in the Corporation's investment portfolio, and lengthening fixed rate liabilities, principally borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. In addition, commercial loans are generally structured whereby there is an initial fixed rate period, typically five years, and then adjust based upon a predetermined index if a new fixed rate is not renegotiated. Approximately 47 percent of the loans identified as fixed interest rates above are set to adjust during the term of the loan. Additional loan information can be found in Note 4-Loans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and within the Risk Management section of this report.\nPremises and Equipment\nOn December 31, 2017, premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled approximately $24,382,000, as compared to $24,573,000 on December 31, 2016. The decrease was a result of depreciation and disposals on existing premises and equipment of $2,348,000 exceeding new acquisitions of $2,157,000.\nOther Assets\nOn December 31, 2017, other assets totaled approximately $53,306,000, compared to $51,689,000 of other assets as of December 31, 2016. Other assets were primarily comprised of investments in bank owned life insurance (BOLI), foreclosed real estate, accrued interest receivable, and deferred tax assets.\nInvestments in life insurance relates to a select group of employees and directors whereby PeoplesBank is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. These investments, carried at the cash surrender value of the underlying policies, totaled $36,632,000 at year-end 2017, compared to $31,621,000 at year-end 2016. PeoplesBank purchased $4,007,000 of BOLI during 2017. The selection of the underlying BOLI insurers is based primarily on the respective insurers' high credit rating and reputation, and competitive tax-exempt yield. The Corporation also seeks to maintain a reasonable diversification among insurers supporting the BOLI portfolio. The level of the Corporation's BOLI investment was approximately 22 percent of PeoplesBank's Tier 1 capital, excluding net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, at December 31, 2017, which is within the regulatory guideline of 25 percent of Tier 1 capital.\nOther assets also include foreclosed real estate, net of allowance, totaling $216,000 at year-end 2017, compared to $2,705,000 at year-end 2016. The $2,489,000 decrease was primarily the result of sale of all of the properties held at December 31, 2016 during 2017. Foreclosed real estate is discussed in the Nonperforming Assets section of this report.\nAlso included with other assets is $4,968,000 of accrued interest receivable on loans and investment securities, and $4,715,000 of net deferred tax assets. Net deferred assets declined year over year primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduced the corporate Federal tax rate to 21 percent. Additional information about these assets can be found in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under the appropriate subheadings.\nFunding\nDeposits\nDeposits are the Corporation's principal source of funding for earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 0.74 percent for the year 2017 as compared to 0.67 percent for the year 2016.\nOn December 31, 2017, deposits totaled $1.38 billion, which represented a $120,330,000 or 10 percent increase compared to the level at year-end 2016. The increase in all deposit categories, primarily money market and time deposits, reflects several rate promotions offered throughout the year. Core deposits, consisting of demand, money market and savings, in aggregate, increased $100,994,000 or 12 percent and time deposits (i.e. CDs) increased $19,336,000 or 5 percent. Of the total $446,021,000 of time deposits as of December 31, 2017, the balance of certificates of deposit with a balance of less than $100,000 totaled $260,482,000, $100,000 to $250,000 totaled $135,242,000 and $250,000 or more totaled $50,297,000. Time deposits totaling $190,146,000 or 43 percent of the total at year-end 2017 will mature in 2018.\nOn December 31, 2017, the balance of certificates of deposit with a balance of $100,000 and above was $185,539,000. Of this total, $28,246,000 mature within three months, $17,961,000 mature after three months but within six months, $33,417,000 mature after six months but within twelve months, and the remaining $105,915,000 mature beyond twelve months. The composition of the Corporation's deposit portfolio at December 31, 2017 is provided in Note 7-Deposits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nShort-term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repo agreements), federal funds purchased, and other borrowings as described more fully in Note 8-Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt, to the consolidated financial statements. On December 31, 2017, short-term borrowings totaled $20,495,000, as compared to the $56,637,000 as of December 31, 2016. The balance on December 31, 2017, consisted of $10,295,000 of repurchase agreements and $10,200,000 of other short-term borrowings as compared to the balance of $56,637,000 at year-end 2016 consisting of $23,637,000 of repurchase agreements and $33,000,000 of short-term borrowings. The decrease in the balance of repurchase agreements was a result of a move in balances into deposit products while other short-term borrowings declined as cash flow from investments and deposits were ample to fund loan growth and maintain adequate liquidity.\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt is a secondary funding source to deposits for asset growth. On December 31, 2017, long-term debt totaled $130,310,000, compared to $125,310,000 at year-end 2016. The increase was the result of $5,000,000 in net new advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLBP).\nGenerally, funds for the payment of long-term debt come from operations. On December 31, 2017, total unused credit with the FHLBP was approximately $346,889,000. Obligations to the FHLBP are secured by FHLBP stock and qualifying collateral, principally real estate secured loans. A listing of outstanding long-term debt obligations is provided in Note 8-Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nShareholders' Equity and Capital Adequacy\nShareholders' equity, or capital, enables the Corporation to maintain asset growth and absorb losses. Capital adequacy can be affected by a multitude of factors, including profitability, new stock issuances, corporate expansion, balance sheet growth, dividend policy, and regulatory mandates.\nTotal shareholders' equity was $164,219,000 on December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $9,262,000 or 6 percent, compared to $154,957,000 at year-end 2016. The increase was primarily the result the Corporation's $12,004,000 in net income available for common shareholders less $4,559,000 of dividends paid to common shareholders for 2017. Information pertaining to preferred and common stock of the Corporation is disclosed in Note 10-Shareholders' Equity, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nRedemption of Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends\nAs previously disclosed, the Corporation participated in the U.S. Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Small Business Lending Fund Program (SBLF Program). Information about the SBLF Program is provided in Note 10-Shareholders' Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. Under the SBLF program, the Corporation originally issued $25,000,000, or 25,000 shares of non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock, Series B, $1,000 liquidation value, $2.50 par value to the Treasury.\nThe SBLF preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 regulatory capital and requires the payment of non-cumulative cash dividends quarterly on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. Preferred stock dividends for 2016 were $16,000, a decrease of $104,000 compared to $120,000 of preferred stock dividends in 2015. On February 18, 2016, Codorus Valley redeemed the remaining $12,000,000, or 12,000 shares of Series B preferred stock issued to the Treasury as reported on form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016. The annualized dividend rate on the preferred stock issued under the SBLF Program was 1 percent through the redemption date of February 18, 2016.\nDividends on Common Stock\nThe Corporation typically pays cash dividends on its common stock on a quarterly basis. The Board of Directors determines the dividend rate after considering the Corporation's capital requirements, current and projected net income, and other factors. Annual cash dividends per common share for the year 2017 totaled $0.516 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.044 or 9 percent above the cash dividends of $0.472, as adjusted, paid for the year 2016.\nPeriodically, the Corporation distributes stock dividends on its common stock. On December 12, 2017, the Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 24, 2017. A 5 percent common stock dividend was also distributed in December 2016.\nCompensation Plans\nAs disclosed in this report, the Corporation maintains various employee and director benefit plans that could result in the issuance of its common stock or affect its earnings.

Quantitative measures established by regulators pertain to minimum capital ratios, as set forth in Table 9 below. The table provides a comparison of the Corporation's and PeoplesBank's risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios to the minimum regulatory requirement for the periods indicated.\nTable 9-Capital Ratios\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ratios </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Federal Minimum </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Federal </td> <td> </td> <td>Capital (2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>at December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Required (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Well </td> <td> </td> <td>at December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Capitalized </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common Equity Tier 1 Capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(as a percentage of risk weighted assets) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc.

At December 31, 2016, the minimum amounts and ratios included the first year phase in of the capital conservation buffer of 0.625 percent required by the Basel III framework. The conservation buffer is to be phased in over a four year period beginning January 1, 2016, with the full 2.5 percent required as of January 1, 2019. \n (2) Net unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, net of taxes, are disregarded for capital ratio computation purposes in accordance with federal regulatory banking guidelines. \nOn July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System finalized its rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework, which the FDIC adopted on July 9, 2013. Under the rule, minimum requirements will increase both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. Consistent with the Basel III framework, the rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent, and a common equity Tier 1 conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, that will apply to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4 percent to 6 percent, and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent for all banking organizations. The new rule also increases the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors. The rule for smaller, less complex institutions, including the Corporation and PeoplesBank, became effective January 1, 2015.\nThe new rule provides that, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer, which is to be phased in over a four year period beginning January 1, 2016, with the full 2.5 percent required as of January 1, 2019.\nThe transition schedule for new ratios, including the capital conservation buffer, is as follows:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>As of January 1:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td>2016 </td> <td>2017 </td> <td>2018 </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>4.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>0.625% </td> <td>1.25% </td> <td>1.875% </td> <td>2.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer </td> <td>4.5% </td> <td>5.125% </td> <td>5.75% </td> <td>6.375% </td> <td>7.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Phase-in of most deductions from common equity Tier 1 capital </td> <td>40% </td> <td>60% </td> <td>80% </td> <td>100% </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum Tier 1 capital ratio </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td>6.0% </td> <td>6.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum Tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>6.625% </td> <td>7.25% </td> <td>7.875% </td> <td>8.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum total capital ratio </td> <td>8.0% </td> <td>8.0% </td> <td>8.0% </td> <td>8.0% </td> <td>8.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum total capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>8.625% </td> <td>9.25% </td> <td>9.875% </td> <td>10.5% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs fully phased in, a banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5 percent would not be subject to limits on dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer less than 2.5 percent would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The new rule also prohibits a banking organization from making dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 percent as of the beginning of that quarter. Eligible net income is defined as net income for the 4 calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. A summary of payout restrictions based on the capital conservation buffer is as follows:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>Capital Conservation Buffer\n(as a % of risk-weighted assets)\n</td> <td>Maximum Payout\n(as a % of eligible retained income)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Greater than 2.5% </td> <td>No payout limitation applies </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u22642.5% and >1.875% </td> <td>60% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u22641.875% and >1.25% </td> <td>40% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u22641.25% and >0.625% </td> <td>20% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\u22640.625% </td> <td>0% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporation's regulatory capital position at December 31, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in Table 9 above, reflects compliance with the new rule requirements that became effective January 1, 2015. The Corporation plans to manage its capital to ensure continued compliance.\nRisk Management\nThe Corporation's Enterprise Risk Management Committee ( Committee\u201d) meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and at least one independent director. The objective of the Committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the Corporation and its affiliates. While the Committee's risk review is broad in scope, its primary responsibility is to develop, implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures.\nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the possibility that a loan client, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms, posing one of the most significant risks of loss to the Corporation. Accordingly, the Corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk. To support this objective, a lending policy framework has been established which management believes is sound given the nature and scope of our operations. This framework includes seven basic policy parameters that guide the lending process and minimize risk:\n \u25cf The Corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures. \n \u25cf Lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount, loan type, level of risk, and loan officer experience. \n \u25cf Loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the Board level to review and approve loans that exceed pre-established dollar thresholds and/or meet other criteria. \n \u25cf The Corporation lends mainly within its primary geographical market area, including York County, Cumberland County, and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and Harford County, Baltimore County, Baltimore City and Carroll County, Maryland. Although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk, the diverse local economies and employee knowledge of our clients lessens this risk. \n \u25cf The loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single client or small group of related clients. \n \u25cf The Corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market, nor does it invest in securities backed by subprime mortgages. \n \u25cf The Corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein. \nThe Corporation uses loan-to-value ratios ( LTV ratios\u201d) for loan underwriting, establishing generally acceptable ratios of the loan amount to the value of the collateral securing the loan, to minimize the risk of future loss from the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017, the LTV ratios listed below were in effect.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>LTV ratio % </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Owner </td> <td>Non-owner </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan type </td> <td> </td> <td>Occupied </td> <td>Occupied </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential, owner occupied 1-4 units, tax assessment (PA) </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td>80 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential, owner occupied 1-4 units, tax assessment (MD) </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td>90 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential, owner occupied 1-4 units, certified appraisal </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>75 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential construction - spec </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>70 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential construction - presold </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>80 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential rehab for resale </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>70 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>75 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential (5 or more units) </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td>75 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td>75 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Raw Land </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td>60 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Approved, but unimproved land </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>65 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Approved and improved land </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>70 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>65 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Hotels/motels and mobile home parks </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td>65 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Special/Limited use properties </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td>50 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn acceptable valuation is required on all real estate secured loans. Generally, an appraisal performed by an independent licensed appraiser is required for real estate secured loans under any of the following conditions:\n \u25cf loan amount is above $250,000; \n \u25cf or if the LTV is above 75 percent for commercial non-owner occupied property; \n \u25cf or if the LTV is above 80 percent for commercial owner occupied property; \n \u25cf or if the loan amount is greater than 90 percent of the tax assessed value for owner-occupied residential real estate in Pennsylvania; \n \u25cf or if the loan amount is greater than 90 percent of the tax assessed value for owner-occupied residential real estate in Maryland; \n \u25cf or if an existing appraisal is more than two years old (unless there was a material change in market conditions or the physical aspects of the property). \nExceptions to LTV ratios and the use of a licensed appraiser are sometimes made by management or the Board of Directors when there are compensating factors.\nOne component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations, defined as greater than 10 percent of the total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, the Corporation had three industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: commercial real estate investor represented 16.5 percent of the portfolio; residential real estate investor represented 15.0 percent of the portfolio; and builder and developer represented 13.2 percent of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had the same three industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: commercial real estate investor, which represented 19.2 percent of the portfolio; residential real estate investor, which represented 14.4 percent of the portfolio; and builder & developer, which represented 11.7 percent of the portfolio. Loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate.\nIn addition to a comprehensive lending policy, numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year. These portfolios, or selected accounts therein, are also examined periodically by the Corporation's or PeoplesBank's regulators.\nNonperforming Assets\nTable 10 - Nonperforming Assets, below, presents a five-year history of asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss and related ratios.\nTable 10-Nonperforming Assets\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td>

reflects notable progress in reducing or maintaining the level of nonperforming assets. This has been accomplished through continuous collection efforts coordinated by the Corporation's General Counsel, recoveries from borrower payments and foreclosed real estate sales, the establishment of valuation allowances for selective accounts, and if necessary, loan charge-offs. In monitoring and managing nonperforming assets, we remain concerned about the impact of changing economic conditions, and the potential for adverse real estate market value changes, and the corresponding effects on commercial borrowers.\nNonperforming assets are reviewed by management on a monthly basis. We generally rely on appraisals performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of real estate collateral for impaired collateral-dependent loans. Generally, an appraisal is performed when: (i) an account reaches 90 days past due, unless a certified appraisal was completed within the past twelve months; (ii) market values have changed significantly; (iii) the condition of the property has changed significantly; or (iv) the existing appraisal is outdated based upon regulatory or policy requirements. In instances where the value of the collateral is less than the net carrying amount of the loan, a specific loss allowance is established for the difference by recording a loss provision to the income statement. When it is probable that some portion or all of the loan balance will not be collected, that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the nonperforming loan portfolio balance totaled $5,128,000, compared to $3,847,000 at year-end 2016. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due. The Corporation generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest income (i.e., recognizes interest income on a cash basis as long as the loan is sufficiently collateralized) when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due 90 days or more. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest represent loans that are contractually past due, but are well collateralized and in the process of collection. A loan is returned to interest accruing status when we determine that circumstances have improved to the extent that all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are current for at least six consecutive payments and future payments are reasonably assured. As of December 31, 2017, the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance totaled $5,052,000, compared to $3,114,000 at year-end 2016. The increase in nonaccrual loans resulted from reductions totaling $6,914,000 primarily principal repayments and charge-offs, which was offset by loans totaling $8,852,000 being placed on nonaccrual status. For both periods, the nonperforming loan portfolio balance was comprised primarily of collateralized commercial loans. For 2017, the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately $359,000. The amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for 2017 was approximately $164,000. The interest income recognized on impaired loans in Note 4-Loans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, is a higher amount because it includes interest income on all impaired loans, which includes nonaccrual loans, from the time the loan was impaired.\nForeclosed real estate represents real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to PeoplesBank and is included in the Other Assets category on the Corporation's balance sheet. The carrying amount of foreclosed real estate as of December 31, 2017, net of allowance, totaled $216,000, a decrease of $2,489,000 or 92 percent, compared to $2,705,000 at year-end 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of one property.\nTroubled debt restructurings pertain to loans whose terms have been modified to include a concession that we would not ordinarily consider due to the debtor's financial difficulties. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring typically involve a reduction of interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, the deferral of payments or extension of the stated maturity date. Troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment if they have been restructured during the most recent calendar year, or if they cease to perform in accordance with the modified terms. As of December 31, 2017, the accruing troubled debt restructuring portfolio balance totaled $3,344,000, compared to $3,664,000 at year-end 2016. The decrease was the result of principal payments made on loans within the troubled debt restructuring portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2017, there were $18,141,000 in additional potential problem loans being closely monitored by management. These additional potential problem loans consist of loans classified as substandard, reflecting an increased risk of the borrowers' ability to comply with present repayment terms. These loans are not classified as nonperforming and are not disclosed in Table 10. Comparatively, we were monitoring $11,979,000 of potential problem loans at December 31, 2016.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAlthough the Corporation believes that it maintains sound credit policies, certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. The allowance is based upon management's continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis, which is subject to review and approval by the Board. An overview of the methodology and key factors that we use in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance and loan impairment is provided in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists primarily of three components: (i) specific allowances for individually impaired commercial loans; (ii) allowances calculated for pools of loans; and (iii) an unallocated component, which reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the assumptions that underlie the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The Corporation uses an internal risk rating system to evaluate individual loans. Loans are segmented into industry groups or pools with similar characteristics, and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on quantitative factors such as recent loss history (two-year rolling average of net charge-offs) and qualitative factors, such as the results of internal and external credit reviews, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, adequacy of collateral, and general economic conditions. Determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is subjective, particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods, and requires that we make estimates using assumptions. There is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance as a result of regulatory examinations.\nAn analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five-year period is presented in Table 11 - Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses, below. A more detailed analysis of the allowance for the current year is provided in Note 5 -Allowance for Loan Losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $16,689,000 or 1.19 percent of total loans, on December 31, 2017, compared to $14,992,000 and 1.18 percent, respectively, on December 31, 2016. The $1,697,000 or 11 percent increase in the allowance from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, was generally consistent with the $128,993,000 or 10 percent overall increase in loan growth (primarily commercial loans), net of deferred fees, over the same 12 month period.\nBased on our comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, and recognizing other relevant considerations including expected continued loan growth, continued uncertainty on certain larger criticized assets as legal and collection efforts continue, and the unknown impact of future accounting and regulatory requirements related to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, we believe that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2017.\nTable 11 -Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Balance -

For example, we believe that we could face increasing credit risks and uncertainties, not yet reflected in current leading indicators, associated with prolonged low economic growth, or potential recessionary business conditions for certain industries or the broad economy, or the erosion of real estate values, any or all of which can adversely affect our borrowers' ability to service their loans.\nAdditionally, we have experienced continued strong commercial loan growth, including growth in newer markets where we have less of a loss history. Also, we recognize the inherent imprecision in any methodology for estimating specific and general loan losses, including the unpredictable timing and amounts of charge-offs and related historical loss averages, and specific-credit or broader portfolio future cash flow value and collateral valuation uncertainties which could negatively impact unimpaired portfolio loss factors. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, we maintained a 13 percent unallocated portion of our allowance for loan losses, similar to a 12 percent unallocated portion of the allowance as of December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity\nMaintaining adequate liquidity provides the Corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors, loan clients, employees, and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business. Additionally, it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise. Liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the Corporation's assets and liabilities. The primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows, funds received from client loan payments and, to a lesser degree, asset sales. The primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, included in this report, present the changes in cash from operating, investing and financing activities. At year-end 2017, we believe our liquidity was adequate based upon the potential liquidation of unpledged available-for-sale securities with a fair value totaling approximately $52,988,000 and available credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh totaling approximately $346,889,000. The Corporation's loan-to-deposit ratio was approximately 101 percent as of year-end 2017 and 2016. The ratio was flat as period end deposit growth was in line with loan growth in 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Corporation's financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. These commitments consist primarily of commitments to grant new loans, unfunded commitments under existing loan facilities, and letters of credit issued under the same standards as on-balance sheet instruments. Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk are disclosed in Note 14-Commitments to Extend Credit, to the consolidated financial statements, and totaled $508,575,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to $449,178,000 at December 31, 2016. Generally, these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes. Accordingly, many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and, therefore, generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the Corporation or PeoplesBank.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the amount and timing of payments due under long-term contractual obligations.\nTable 13-Contractual Obligations\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>446,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>675 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Supplemental retirement plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,454 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Naming rights </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>590,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>246,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,735 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity-to-assets ratio. Inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses, which tend to rise during periods of general inflation. The level of inflation can be measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers (December vs. December). The change in the CPI for 2017 and 2016 was 2.1 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for 2015.\nManagement believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the Corporation's ability to react to changes in market interest rates. Management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, management is focused on increasing fee income, an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates.", "item_7_text": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the results of operations, capital resources and liquidity presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc. ( Codorus Valley\u201d or the Corporation\u201d), a bank holding company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, PeoplesBank, A Codorus Valley Company ( PeoplesBank\u201d), are provided below. Codorus Valley's consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist almost entirely of PeoplesBank's financial condition and results of operations. Current performance does not guarantee and may not be indicative of similar performance in the future.\nForward-looking Statements\nManagement of the Corporation has made forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements may be subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. When words such as believes,\u201d expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d or similar expressions are used in this Form 10-K, management is making forward-looking statements.\nNote that many factors, some of which are discussed elsewhere in this report and in the documents that are incorporated by reference, could affect the future financial results of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, both individually and collectively, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u25cf Operating, legal and regulatory risks; \n \u25cf Credit risk, including an increase in nonperforming assets requiring loss provisions and the incurrence of carrying costs related to nonperforming assets; \n \u25cf Interest rate fluctuations which could increase our cost of funds or decrease our yield on earning assets and therefore reduce our net interest income; \n \u25cf Declines in the market value of investment securities considered to be other-than-temporary; \n \u25cf Unavailability of capital when needed or availability at less than favorable terms; \n \u25cf Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise, may adversely affect the Corporation's operations, net income or reputation; \n \u25cf Inability to achieve merger-related synergies, and difficulties in integrating the business and operations of acquired institutions; \n \u25cf A prolonged economic downturn or excessive inflation; \n \u25cf Political and competitive forces affecting banking, securities, asset management and credit services businesses; \n \u25cf The effects of and changes in the rate of FDIC premiums, including special assessments; \n \u25cf Future legislative or administrative changes to U.S. governmental capital programs; \n \u25cf Future changes in federal or state tax laws or tax rates; \n \u25cf Enacted financial reform legislation, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, may have a significant impact on the Corporation's business and results of operations; and \n \u25cf The risk that management's analyses of these risks and forces could be incorrect and/or that the strategies developed to address them could be unsuccessful. \nThe Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nDisclosure of Codorus Valley's significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Some of these policies require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. Management makes significant estimates in determining the allowance for loan losses, valuation of foreclosed real estate, and evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment losses of securities.\nManagement considers a variety of factors in establishing allowance for loan losses such as current economic conditions, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews, financial and managerial strength of borrowers, adequacy of collateral, (if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows) and other relevant factors. There is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as a result of regulatory examinations.\nForeclosed real estate is initially recorded at fair value minus estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Appraisals are generally used to determine fair value. After foreclosure, management reviews valuations at least quarterly and adjusts the asset to the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell. Estimates related to the value of collateral can have a significant impact on whether or not management continues to accrue income on delinquent and impaired loans and on the amounts at which foreclosed real estate is recorded on the statement of financial condition.\nThe Corporation records its available-for-sale securities portfolio at fair value. Fair values for these securities are determined based on methodologies in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820. Fair values for debt securities are volatile and may be influenced by any number of factors, including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, credit ratings and yield curves. Fair values for debt securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security. When the fair value of a debt security is below its amortized cost and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost, additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment condition exists. Debt securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The analysis considers whether the Corporation has the intent to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity and whether it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity. Often, information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing, making estimates of fair value subject to judgment. If actual information or conditions are different than estimated, the extent of the impairment of the debt security may be different than previously estimated, which could have a material effect on the Corporation's results of operations and financial condition.\nManagement discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related Management Discussion and Analysis disclosures with the Audit Committee. There were no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented within this report. Additional information is contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis regarding critical accounting estimates, including the provision and allowance for loan losses located on pages 37 and 55 of this report.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nExecutive Summary\nThe Corporation's net income available to common shareholders (earnings) was $12,004,000 for the full year 2017, compared to $13,086,000 of earnings in 2016, a decrease of $1,082,000 or 8 percent. The decrease in net income and earnings per share for the year was primarily the result of a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n \u25cf Net interest income for 2017 increased $5,966,000 or 11 percent when compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the volume of commercial loans. \n \u25cf Net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis) for 2017 was 3.84 percent, compared to 3.89 percent for 2016. The Corporation continues to have success in growing lower cost core deposits, while maintaining reasonable yields on new loan growth in a highly competitive environment. The average yield on earning assets increased to 4.53 percent in 2017 as compared to 4.51 percent in 2016 and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.86 percent in 2017, as compared to 0.76 percent in 2016. \n \u25cf The loan loss provision for 2017 increased $1,175,000 compared to 2016, primary due to growth in commercial loans and an increase in net charge-offs in 2017 as compared to the prior year. \n \u25cf Noninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $11,443,000 representing an increase of $1,607,000 or 16 percent compared to noninterest income of $9,836,000 for 2016. Specific noninterest income increases included trust fees, service charges on deposits, income from bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of loans held for sale. Gains on sales of investment securities for 2017 decreased $115,000 when compared to 2016. \n \u25cf Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $44,986,000 representing an increase of $3,363,000 or 8 percent compared to $41,623,000 for 2016. Higher costs associated with: personnel, external data processing, charitable contributions and other expenses, accounted for the majority of the increase. The primary driver of the aforementioned increase in noninterest expense was the expansion of our business and consumer banking in and support services for our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets. \n \u25cf The provision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $9,904,000 which was $4,018,000 or 68 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2016 of $5,886,000. The increase was due to a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $2,920,000 increase in pre-tax net income. \n \u25cf Earnings per share were $1.35 basic and $1.34 diluted for 2017 compared to $1.49 basic and $1.48 diluted for 2016. The decrease in earnings per share for the year was primarily the result of the aforementioned reduction in the net deferred tax asset value. \nOn December 31, 2017, total assets were approximately $1.71 billion, representing a 6 percent increase compared to December 31, 2016. The growth for 2017 occurred primarily in the commercial loan portfolio and was funded primarily by an increase in deposits.\nThe Corporation's capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions.\nThe closing price for the Corporation's common stock (NASDAQ: CVLY) was $27.53 per share on December 31, 2017, compared to $27.24 per share on December 31, 2016, as adjusted. Cash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2017 totaled $0.516 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.044 or 9 percent above the cash dividends of $0.472, as adjusted, paid for the year 2016. Also, the Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend on December 12, 2017. The Selected Financial Data schedule, located on page 28 of this report, provides a summary of operations and performance metrics for the past five years in a comparative format.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe full year 2017, net income available to common shareholders of $12,004,000 represents a decrease of $1,082,000 compared to the full year 2016 earnings of $13,086,000. Earnings per share was $1.35 basic and $1.34 diluted for 2017 compared to $1.49 basic and $1.48 diluted for 2016. The decrease in net income and earnings per share for year was primarily the result of a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet interest income, which totaled $59,547,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, represented an increase of $5,966,000 or 11 percent above net interest income of $53,581,000 for 2016. The growth in net interest income reflects the increased volume of interest-earning assets, primarily commercial loans; however, the additional interest income from this new loan volume was partially offset by increased costs associated with the growth in core deposits and an increase in volume and rates paid for both time deposits and long-term borrowings.\nThe loan loss provision for 2017 totaled $4,175,000 as compared to the loan loss provision of $3,000,000 for 2016, an increase of $1,175,000. The increase in the provision was primarily a result of an increase in net charge-offs of $1,766,000 in 2017 compared to 2016 and commercial loan portfolio growth. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.19 percent and 1.18 percent as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increased allowance for loan losses reflected both the overall commercial loan growth for 2017, and the Corporation's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs.\nNoninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $11,443,000 representing an increase of $1,607,000 or 16 percent compared to noninterest income of $9,836,000 for 2016. Specific noninterest income increases included trust fees, service charges on deposits, income from bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of loans held for sale. Gains on sales of investment securities for 2017 decreased $115,000 when compared to 2016.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $44,986,000 representing an increase of $3,363,000 or 8 percent compared to $41,623,000 for 2016. Higher costs associated with: personnel, external data processing, charitable contributions and other expenses, accounted for the majority of the increase. The primary driver of the aforementioned increase in noninterest expense was the expansion of our business and consumer banking in and support services for our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $9,904,000 which was $4,018,000 or 68 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2016 of $5,886,000. The increase was due to a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $2,920,000 increase in pre-tax net income.\nOn December 31, 2017, total assets were $1.71 billion, representing an 6 percent increase compared to total assets of $1.61 billion as of December 31, 2016. Asset growth for 2017 occurred primarily in the commercial loan portfolio and was funded primarily by an increase in deposits.\nThe growth in core deposits included a $35,740,000 increase in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits for 2017 as compared to 2016. Growing core deposits remains a particular focus of the Corporation because the rates paid for such deposits are low, transactional activity on these deposits are a source of fee income, and a core deposit relationship provides the opportunity to cross-sell other financial products and services. The Corporation excludes time deposits in its definition of core deposits.\nCash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2017 totaled $0.516 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.044 or 9 percent above the cash dividends of $0.472, as adjusted, paid for the year 2016.\nThe Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend on December 12, 2017, the same common stock dividend percentage that was distributed in December 2016.\nThe Corporation's capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions. Table 9 - Capital Ratios, following, shows that both the Corporation and PeoplesBank were well capitalized for all periods presented.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe full year 2016 net income available to common shareholders of $13,086,000 represents an increase of $2,071,000 compared to the full year 2015 earnings of $11,015,000. Earnings per share was $1.49 basic and $1.48 diluted for 2016 compared to $1.60 basic and $1.59 diluted for 2015, as adjusted for stock dividends. The decrease is primarily a result of the issuance of 1,746,850 of common shares in the $34,500,000 public offering completed in December 2015. The Corporation used the funds from the public offering to redeem the remaining $12,000,000 of shares of Series B preferred stock issued under the U.S. Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program, as reported on a Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016. In addition, approximately $19,800,000 of the net proceeds were invested in the Corporation's Bank subsidiary PeoplesBank and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nNet interest income, which totaled $53,581,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, represented an increase of $5,753,000 or 12 percent above net interest income of $47,828,000 for 2015. The growth in net interest income reflects the increased volume of interest-earning assets, primarily commercial loans; however, the additional interest income from this new loan volume was partially offset by increased costs associated with the growth in core deposits and higher long-term borrowing costs.\nThe loan loss provision for 2016 totaled $3,000,000 as compared to the loan loss provision of $3,500,000 for 2015, a decrease of $500,000. The decrease in the provision was primarily a result of a reduction in net charge-offs of $1,246,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.18 percent and 1.13 percent as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increased allowance for loan losses reflected both the overall commercial loan growth for 2016, and the Corporation's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs.\nNoninterest income, excluding gains on sales of investment securities, for the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $9,836,000 representing an increase of $1,281,000 or 15 percent compared to noninterest income of $8,555,000 for 2015. Specific noninterest income increases included trust fees, income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales, service charges on deposits, income from bank owned life insurance and gains on sales of loans held for sale. Gains on sales of investment securities for 2016 decreased $298,000 when compared to 2015.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $41,623,000 representing an increase of $4,196,000 or 11 percent compared to $37,427,000 for 2015. Higher costs associated with: personnel, charitable donations, external data processing, debit card processing, FDIC insurance and other expenses, accounted for the majority of the increase. The primary driver of the aforementioned increase in noninterest expense was the expansion of our business and consumer banking services in our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2016 totaled $5,886,000 which was $1,073,000 or 22 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2015 of $4,813,000. The increase was due to higher pre-tax net income and a slight decrease in the amount of tax-exempt income.\nPreferred stock dividends for 2016 were $16,000, a decrease of $104,000, compared to $120,000 in 2015. The preferred stock dividend rate for both years was 1 percent. On February 18, 2016, as reported on a Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016, the Corporation redeemed the remaining $12,000,000 in outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock issued under the U.S. Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program, resulting in the reduction in dividends expense for the year.\nOn December 31, 2016, total assets were $1.61 billion, representing an 11 percent increase compared to total assets of $1.46 billion as of December 31, 2015. Asset growth for 2016 occurred primarily in the commercial loan portfolio and was funded primarily by an increase in deposits.\nThe growth in core deposits included a $37,694,000 increase in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits for 2016 as compared to 2015. Growing core deposits remains a particular focus of the Corporation because the rates paid for such deposits are low, transactional activity on these deposits are a source of fee income, and a core deposit relationship provides the opportunity to cross-sell other financial products and services. The Corporation excludes time deposits in its definition of core deposits.\nCash dividends paid on common shares for the year 2016 totaled $0.472 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.032 or 7 percent above the cash dividends of $0.440, as adjusted, paid for the year 2015.\nThe Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend on December 13, 2016, the same common stock dividend percentage that was distributed in December 2015.\nAs a result of profitable operations and the public offering of common stock as previously reported on Form 8-Ks filed on December 15, 2015 and December 23, 2015, the Corporation's capital level remained sound as evidenced by capital ratios that exceed current regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions. Table 9 - Capital Ratios, following, shows that both the Corporation and PeoplesBank were well capitalized for all periods presented.\nINCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS\nNet Interest Income\nThe Corporation's principal source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between (i) interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and (ii) interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds. Fluctuations in net interest income are caused by changes in both interest rates, and the volume and composition of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Unless otherwise noted, this section discusses interest income and interest expense amounts as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which are not presented on a tax equivalent basis.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $59,547,000, an increase of $5,966,000 or 11 percent above the full year 2016 net interest income. The increase was supported by a 12 percent increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets, primarily commercial loans. The additional interest income from the increased loan volume was partially offset by the costs associated with the growth in core deposits and an increase in volume and rates paid for both time deposits and long-term borrowings. The net interest margin, which reflects net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, was 3.84 percent for 2017, compared to 3.89 percent for 2016.\nInterest income for the full year 2017 totaled $70,415,000, an increase of $8,185,000 or 13 percent above 2016. The increase in total interest income was driven by a growth in the average volume of loans which was partially offset by a decrease in the average volume of investment securities. Interest earning assets averaged $1.57 billion and yielded 4.53 percent (tax equivalent basis) for 2017, compared to $1.40 billion and a tax-equivalent yield of 4.51 percent, respectively, for 2016.\nInterest expense for the full year 2017 totaled $10,868,000, an increase of $2,219,000 or 26 percent above 2016. The increase in total interest expense was primarily driven by an increase in volume and rate in core deposits (the Corporation defines core deposits as demand, savings, and money market deposits) and an increase in the rates paid on time deposits and long-term borrowings. Interest expense on deposits increased $1,471,000 or 22 percent for 2017 compared to 2016 and was primarily attributed to the increases in volume and rates paid on in interest bearing core deposits and time deposits. The average volume of interest bearing core deposits was $668,314,000 for the full year 2017, an $86,749,000 or 15 percent increase above the average volume for 2016. Interest expense on long-term debt increased $594,000 or 33 percent for 2017. The average rate paid on long-term borrowings in 2017 reflected a 1.83 percent increase from the average rate paid of 1.65 percent in 2016. Long-term debt is primarily comprised of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, with intermediate term bullet maturities that supplement deposit funding and provide a partial funding hedge against rising market interest rates.\nTables 1 and 2, following, are presented on a tax-equivalent basis to make it easier to compare taxable and tax-exempt assets. Interest on tax-exempt assets (which include securities issued by, or loans made to, state and local governments) is adjusted based upon a 35 percent federal income tax rate in 2017 compared to a 34 percent rate for 2016 and 2015.\n Table 1-Average Balances and Interest Rates (tax equivalent basis) \n\n (1) Average balance includes average nonaccrual loans of $5,095,000 in 2017, $2,692,000 in 2016, and $7,145,000 in 2015. Interest includes net loan fees of $2,995,000 in 2017, $3,370,000 in 2016, and $2,067,000 in 2015. \n (2) Average balance includes average bank owned life insurance, foreclosed real estate and unrealized holding gains (losses) on investment securities. \n (3) Net interest income (tax equivalent basis) annualized as a percent of average interest earning assets. \nTable 2-Rate/Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income (tax equivalent basis)\n\nChanges which are due to both volume and rate are allocated in proportion to their relationship to the amount of change attributed directly to volume or rate.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is an expense charged to earnings to cover estimated losses attributable to uncollectable loans. The provision reflects management's judgment of an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses. The Risk Management section of this report, including Table 10 - Nonperforming Assets, Table 11 - Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses, and Table 12 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, provides detailed information about the allowance for loan losses, the loan loss provision, and credit risk.\nFor the year 2017, the provision for loan losses was $4,175,000, which was $1,175,000 or 39 percent higher, compared to a provision of $3,000,000 in 2016. The increased provision for loan losses was impacted by an increase in net charge-offs in 2017 of $1,766,000. One loan in the construction and land development portfolio was primary the contributor to the increase in net charge-offs. The provision for both periods supported adequate allowance for loan loss coverage, including the Corporation's substantial growth in commercial loans, and the Corporation's analysis of the adequacy of the allowance based upon the size, composition, and risks to the loan portfolio, the level of specific reserves, and realized net charge-offs.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents the components of total noninterest income for each of the past three years.\n\nFor the year 2017, the overall $1,492,000 or 15 percent increase in total noninterest income, compared to the year 2016, was primarily the result of increases in trust fees, service charges on deposit, income from bank owned life insurance, and gains on sales of loans held for sale. The discussion that follows addresses changes in selected categories of noninterest income.\nTrust and investment services fees-The upward trend in trust and investment services fee income over the three year period presented was due to growth in trust assets under management from both new accounts, and appreciation in the market value of managed accounts, upon which some fees are based.\nIncome from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales- Income from mutual fund, annuity and insurance sales declined during the current year due to the implementation of a new regulatory rule resulting in reduced commissions. Despite the reduced fees in the current year, assets under management have shown a steady increase over the last three year period. The non-deposit investment products are sold by PeoplesBank's subsidiaries Codorus Valley Financial Advisors, Inc. d/b/a PeoplesWealth Advisors.\nService charges on deposit accounts-For the year 2017, the $468,000 or 13 percent increase in service charge income compared to the year 2016 was due to an increase in the volume of demand deposit accounts subject to fees and debit card transactions. For the year 2016, service charge income increased $290,000 or 9 percent as compared to the year 2015.\nIncome from bank owned life insurance (BOLI)-For the year 2017, the $167,000 or 19 percent increase in income from BOLI compared to 2016 was primarily due to additional investments totaling $4,007,000 during 2017. For the year 2016, the $167,000 or 24 percent increase in income from BOLI compared to 2015 was primarily due to additional investments totaling $6,987,000 during 2016.\nNet gain on sales of loans held for sale-The upward trend in net gains from the sale of loans held for sale is primarily due to a favorable trend in sales of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and selling the guaranteed portion of secondary-market qualified loans originated through programs with the Small Business Administration.\nNet gain on sales of securities-For the year 2017, the Corporation realized $79,000 in gains on sales of securities compared to $194,000 and $492,000 for the full years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Securities sold included those where market pricing for certain instruments provided a favorable total return upon the sales and reinvestment of proceeds, versus holding the respective securities to maturity. In addition, sales provided cash to meet short-term liquidity needs.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of total noninterest expense for each of the past three years.\n\nTotal noninterest expense for the year 2017 increased $3,363,000 or 8 percent above the year 2016, reflecting the overall expansion of our business and consumer banking in and support services for our Maryland and Pennsylvania markets. The discussion that follows addresses changes in selected noninterest expenses.\nPersonnel-The upward trend in personnel expense was due largely to an increase in wage and benefit costs resulting from planned staff additions to support our expanded business and consumer banking services in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Also contributing to the increase is a higher cost of health insurance.\nOccupancy of premises, net- Occupancy of premises expense is comprised of rent, depreciation, maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes and utilities. The level of expense can vary annually based upon franchise expansion, repairs and maintenance, and normal business growth.\nFurniture and equipment-The upward trend in furniture and equipment expense was in alignment with the increased personnel expense, as additional furniture, computer hardware and software (and related depreciation and maintenance expenses) were incurred to support staff growth. During 2017, overall maintenance and repair expenses declined compared to 2016 offsetting some of the aforementioned increases in expenses.\nPostage, stationary and supplies-The level of postage, stationary and supplies can vary based on growth in loan and deposit customers, franchise expansion, postage rate changes, and marketing promotions.\nProfessional and legal-The level of professional and legal expense can fluctuate annually based on the varying needs for legal, accounting and consulting services, which is driven in part by the level of routine lawsuits in the ordinary course of business and the number and complexity of corporate initiatives.\nMarketing- The upward trend in marketing expense reflects an increased operating budget to support normal business growth, and corporate initiatives such as branding, product advertising and internal promotions. In 2016, marketing expense included initial costs associated with the acquisition of the naming rights to PeoplesBank Park, the facility that houses the York, Pennsylvania-based York Revolution, an independent league baseball team.\nFDIC insurance-FDIC insurance fluctuations are a result of growth in assets and changes in financial ratios and other factors which are used to calculate the assessment multiplier. The change for 2016 as compared to 2015 was a result of a change in the assessment methodology effective with the third quarter 2016 and a lower assessment rate.\nDebit card processing-The upward trend in debit card processing reflects a continual increase in debit card transaction volume, due primarily to the increased number of demand deposit accounts and debit cards offset in the current year by a new contract which reduced the costs per transaction.\nCharitable donations-The level of charitable donations can fluctuate annually due to the timing of payment and the availability of the state tax credits. Some donations to nonprofit organizations qualify for related state tax credits that typically range from 50 to 90 percent of the amount donated, effectively lowering the cost of the donation. PeoplesBank uses state tax credits from donations to reduce its Pennsylvania bank shares tax expense which is included in other expenses as well as Maryland corporate income tax.\nTelecommunications- The upward trend was due primarily to the increases in network capacity, the number of facilities, and personnel.\nExternal data processing-The upward trend in external data processing reflects increased reliance on outsourcing transaction processing to specialized vendors, which is typically performed on their hosted and secure websites, thereby increasing the Corporation's data processing efficiency. Additional expenditures related to expansion in the electronic banking services offered to our client base, and charges for higher transaction volume from normal business growth.\nMerger related- The $474,000 in 2015 of merger related expenses were associated with the Corporation's acquisition of Madison Bancorp, Inc. (the acquisition was completed on January 16, 2015, as disclosed on a Form 8-K filed on the same date). In 2015, acquisition-related expenses included external data processing conversion costs, severance payments, acquisition accounting services and legal expenses.\nForeclosed real estate including (recovery of) provision for losses- A downward trend in the volume of foreclosed assets held resulted in a reduction in year-over-year holding costs including real estate taxes, property maintenance, appraisal fees, and provision for losses. In addition, during 2017, there was a recovery of a prior provision. The $579,000 or 369 percent increase in foreclosed real estate expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily a result of 2015 including a partial recovery of a previous valuation allowance of $746,000 on a large foreclosed real estate property.\nOther expenses -Other expense, comprised of many underlying expenses, increased $704,000 or 21 percent in 2017 as compared to 2016 reflecting additional costs associated with director and committee fees, miscellaneous loan expenses, memberships, Pennsylvania bank shares tax, deposit charge-offs and impaired loans. In 2016, other expenses increased $392,000 or 14 percent as compared to 2015 reflecting additional costs associated with the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities' annual assessment, annual shareholder meeting, Pennsylvania bank shares tax and impaired loans.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for 2017 totaled $9,904,000, which was $4,018,000 or 68 percent above the provision for income taxes for 2016 of $5,886,000. The increase was due to a $2,755,000 reduction in the net deferred tax asset value due to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $2,920,000 increase in pre-tax net income. For both years, the Corporation's incremental statutory federal income tax rate was 35 percent; however, the Corporation's effective income tax rate was approximately 45 percent for 2017, compared to 31 percent for 2016. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to the impact and volume of tax-exempt income, including income from bank owned life insurance and certain municipal securities and loans and the new corporate tax rate.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nNo preferred stock dividends were paid in 2017 as compared to $16,000 for 2016. Preferred stock dividends for 2016 were $16,000, a decrease of $104,000 compared to $120,000 of preferred stock dividends in 2015. On February 18, 2016, as reported on a Form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016, the Corporation redeemed the remaining $12,000,000 in outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock issued under the U.S. Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program, resulting in the reduction in dividends expense for the year. Information about the SBLF Program is provided in Note 10-Shareholders' Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. The preferred stock dividend rate for both 2016 and 2015 was 1 percent of the amount of the average preferred stock outstanding, paid quarterly to the U.S. Treasury.\nBALANCE SHEET REVIEW\nInterest Bearing Deposits with Banks\nInterest bearing deposits with banks totaled $55,566,000 on December 31, 2017, compared to $54,966,000 on December 31, 2016. The balance remained relatively flat as a result of the strong growth in deposits and cash flow from the investment portfolio offset by loan growth, principally commercial loans.\nInvestment Securities (Available-for-Sale)\nThe Corporation's entire investment securities portfolio is classified available-for-sale, and is comprised of interest-earning debt securities (see Table 5 below). Investment securities serve as an important source of liquidity, and provide stable interest income revenue supplementary to the larger loan portfolio. The securities also serve as collateral for public and trust deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and to support borrowing capacity. The investment securities portfolio is managed to comply with the Corporation's Investment Securities Policy, and accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320. Decisions to purchase or sell securities are based on an assessment of current economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment, the demand for loans, liquidity and income requirements.\nThe following table shows the amortized cost and fair value, by type of debt security, for three year-end periods:\n\nAt December 31, 2017, the fair value of securities, available-for-sale, totaled $158,591,000, a decrease compared to the fair value of the investment securities portfolio balance of $194,739,000 at December 31, 2016. For the year 2017, cash inflows from maturities, repayments, and calls were reinvested in commercial loans and paid off short term borrowings. Additionally, approximately $5,613,000 of securities were sold during 2017 to realize $79,000 of gains to meet short-term liquidity needs.\nSecurities available-for-sale are generally comprised of high quality debt instruments. On January 1, 2013, Section 939(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective changing the definition of investment grade by removing reliance on credit ratings by national statistical rating organizations. Investment credit assessment, under the revised definition, requires an active review by the Corporation (i.e., pre-purchase and post-purchase credit risk analysis) of the underlying obligor to determine that the obligor has an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments, and more specifically, that the risk of default is low, and that full and timely repayment of principal and interest is expected. Obligations of the U.S. government and U.S. government sponsored enterprises are not subject to the due diligence requirement. However, the Corporation's municipal securities, and any corporate securities that may be acquired in the future, are subject to the new requirement.\nAs shown in Table 5, above, the Corporation holds investments in the obligations of states and municipalities. Municipalities have many options for meeting their debt obligations, including decreasing costs and service levels, imposing taxes and fees and selling assets. In many cases, municipal debt issues are insured or, in the case of school districts of selected states, backed by specific reserves, which provide additional layers of protection to the investor. Access to the credit market and a good credit rating are high priorities enabling a municipality to meet its current and future funding needs at a reasonable interest cost. For these reasons, defaults on municipal bonds are unusual. The majority of municipal bonds in the Corporation's portfolio are general obligation bonds, which can draw upon multiple sources of revenue, including taxes, for payment. Only a few bonds are revenue bonds, which are dependent upon a single revenue stream for payment, but such bonds are for critical services such as water and sewer. Many of the municipal holdings are also insured or backed by specific school district loss reserves. Based on the results of an independent credit review of the Bank's entire municipal bond portfolio as performed in 2017, and recent bond ratings by national statistical rating organizations, we believe that the municipal investments held by PeoplesBank are investment grade.\nThe table below shows that the available-for-sale securities portfolio had an overall yield of 2.44 percent on December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) Weighted average yields (tax equivalent basis) were calculated on the amortized cost basis. \n (2) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities are included in the maturity categories based on average expected life. \nThe portfolio yield as of December 31, 2017, reflected in the table above, is lower than the 2.51 percent securities portfolio yield as of December 31, 2016. Generally, lower yielding securities, as compared to the yields in maturing and called securities, were purchased in 2017. Purchases included the reinvestment of cash flows from maturities, calls and principal repayments on mortgage-backed bonds, during a year of low market investment interest rates. More information about investment securities is provided in Note 3-Securities, to the consolidated financial statements.\nRestricted Investment in Bank Stocks\nAt December 31, 2017, the Corporation held approximately $6,311,000 in restricted common stock, compared to $6,926,000 at year-end 2016. Investment in restricted stock is a condition of obtaining credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLBP) and the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank, which is a subsidiary of Atlantic Community Bancshares, Inc. (ACBI). Accordingly, changes in the level of restricted stock are the result of member capital requirements and borrowing levels from the FHLBP as described within the Long-term Debt section of this report. Of the total investment as of December 31, 2017, approximately $6,236,000 consisted of stock issued by the FHLBP, with the remainder being restricted stock issued by ACBI. Information about restricted investment in bank stocks, including impairment considerations, is provided in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held for Sale\nOn December 31, 2017, loans held for sale were approximately $1,715,000, compared to $1,548,000 at year-end 2016. The $1,715,000 consists of $1,062,000 residential mortgage loans and $653,000 of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. For both years, PeoplesBank's mortgage banking production focused on originating and selling secondary-market qualifying residential mortgage loans. Beginning in January 2016, PeoplesBank retained mortgage servicing rights on residential mortgage loans sold on the secondary market. In addition, in 2016, PeoplesBank began originating loans partially guaranteed by the Small Business Administration with the intent to sell the guaranteed portion of secondary-market qualifying loans.\nLoans\nOn December 31, 2017, total loans, net of deferred fees, totaled approximately $1.40 billion, compared to $1.27 billion at year end 2016, an increase of $128,993,000 or 10 percent above total loans as of year-end 2016. Most of the increase was due to a $124,466,000 or 12 percent increase in commercial loans, which reflected continued strong commercial loan demand in our markets, and our continued ability to expand existing relationships with creditworthy borrowers, and acquire new loan business, based on our reputation for client service and competitive prices and terms.\nThe average yield (tax-equivalent basis) earned on total loans was 4.90 percent for the full year 2017, as compared to 4.93 percent for the year 2016. Persistent low market interest rates and strong competition in our markets resulted in continuing pricing pressures on new loan and refinancing activities. The composition of the Corporation's loan portfolio, by industry class, at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is provided in Note 4-Loans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents the general composition of total loans for five year-end periods:\nTable 7-Loan Portfolio Composition\n\nThe table below shows at December 31, 2017, the commercial loan portfolio was comprised of approximately $822,285,000 or 69 percent in fixed rate loans, and $375,545,000 or 31 percent in floating rate loans. This compares to $768,149,000 or 72 percent in fixed rate loans, and $305,215,000 or 28 percent in floating rate loans, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Floating rate loans reprice periodically with changes in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Prime Rate, or LIBOR.\nTable 8-Selected Loan Maturities and Interest Rate Sensitivity\n\nDuring 2017, in terms of dollars and percentages more floating rate commercial loans were originated although a majority of the commercial portfolio is fixed rate loans with maturities ranging from five to ten years. Although the commercial loan portfolio's fixed rate volume and longer maturities increase risk if interest rates rise, management has implemented interest rate risk mitigation strategies which include maintaining a shorter duration in the Corporation's investment portfolio, and lengthening fixed rate liabilities, principally borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. In addition, commercial loans are generally structured whereby there is an initial fixed rate period, typically five years, and then adjust based upon a predetermined index if a new fixed rate is not renegotiated. Approximately 47 percent of the loans identified as fixed interest rates above are set to adjust during the term of the loan. Additional loan information can be found in Note 4-Loans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and within the Risk Management section of this report.\nPremises and Equipment\nOn December 31, 2017, premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled approximately $24,382,000, as compared to $24,573,000 on December 31, 2016. The decrease was a result of depreciation and disposals on existing premises and equipment of $2,348,000 exceeding new acquisitions of $2,157,000.\nOther Assets\nOn December 31, 2017, other assets totaled approximately $53,306,000, compared to $51,689,000 of other assets as of December 31, 2016. Other assets were primarily comprised of investments in bank owned life insurance (BOLI), foreclosed real estate, accrued interest receivable, and deferred tax assets.\nInvestments in life insurance relates to a select group of employees and directors whereby PeoplesBank is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. These investments, carried at the cash surrender value of the underlying policies, totaled $36,632,000 at year-end 2017, compared to $31,621,000 at year-end 2016. PeoplesBank purchased $4,007,000 of BOLI during 2017. The selection of the underlying BOLI insurers is based primarily on the respective insurers' high credit rating and reputation, and competitive tax-exempt yield. The Corporation also seeks to maintain a reasonable diversification among insurers supporting the BOLI portfolio. The level of the Corporation's BOLI investment was approximately 22 percent of PeoplesBank's Tier 1 capital, excluding net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, at December 31, 2017, which is within the regulatory guideline of 25 percent of Tier 1 capital.\nOther assets also include foreclosed real estate, net of allowance, totaling $216,000 at year-end 2017, compared to $2,705,000 at year-end 2016. The $2,489,000 decrease was primarily the result of sale of all of the properties held at December 31, 2016 during 2017. Foreclosed real estate is discussed in the Nonperforming Assets section of this report.\nAlso included with other assets is $4,968,000 of accrued interest receivable on loans and investment securities, and $4,715,000 of net deferred tax assets. Net deferred assets declined year over year primarily as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduced the corporate Federal tax rate to 21 percent. Additional information about these assets can be found in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under the appropriate subheadings.\nFunding\nDeposits\nDeposits are the Corporation's principal source of funding for earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 0.74 percent for the year 2017 as compared to 0.67 percent for the year 2016.\nOn December 31, 2017, deposits totaled $1.38 billion, which represented a $120,330,000 or 10 percent increase compared to the level at year-end 2016. The increase in all deposit categories, primarily money market and time deposits, reflects several rate promotions offered throughout the year. Core deposits, consisting of demand, money market and savings, in aggregate, increased $100,994,000 or 12 percent and time deposits (i.e. CDs) increased $19,336,000 or 5 percent. Of the total $446,021,000 of time deposits as of December 31, 2017, the balance of certificates of deposit with a balance of less than $100,000 totaled $260,482,000, $100,000 to $250,000 totaled $135,242,000 and $250,000 or more totaled $50,297,000. Time deposits totaling $190,146,000 or 43 percent of the total at year-end 2017 will mature in 2018.\nOn December 31, 2017, the balance of certificates of deposit with a balance of $100,000 and above was $185,539,000. Of this total, $28,246,000 mature within three months, $17,961,000 mature after three months but within six months, $33,417,000 mature after six months but within twelve months, and the remaining $105,915,000 mature beyond twelve months. The composition of the Corporation's deposit portfolio at December 31, 2017 is provided in Note 7-Deposits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nShort-term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repo agreements), federal funds purchased, and other borrowings as described more fully in Note 8-Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt, to the consolidated financial statements. On December 31, 2017, short-term borrowings totaled $20,495,000, as compared to the $56,637,000 as of December 31, 2016. The balance on December 31, 2017, consisted of $10,295,000 of repurchase agreements and $10,200,000 of other short-term borrowings as compared to the balance of $56,637,000 at year-end 2016 consisting of $23,637,000 of repurchase agreements and $33,000,000 of short-term borrowings. The decrease in the balance of repurchase agreements was a result of a move in balances into deposit products while other short-term borrowings declined as cash flow from investments and deposits were ample to fund loan growth and maintain adequate liquidity.\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt is a secondary funding source to deposits for asset growth. On December 31, 2017, long-term debt totaled $130,310,000, compared to $125,310,000 at year-end 2016. The increase was the result of $5,000,000 in net new advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLBP).\nGenerally, funds for the payment of long-term debt come from operations. On December 31, 2017, total unused credit with the FHLBP was approximately $346,889,000. Obligations to the FHLBP are secured by FHLBP stock and qualifying collateral, principally real estate secured loans. A listing of outstanding long-term debt obligations is provided in Note 8-Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nShareholders' Equity and Capital Adequacy\nShareholders' equity, or capital, enables the Corporation to maintain asset growth and absorb losses. Capital adequacy can be affected by a multitude of factors, including profitability, new stock issuances, corporate expansion, balance sheet growth, dividend policy, and regulatory mandates.\nTotal shareholders' equity was $164,219,000 on December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $9,262,000 or 6 percent, compared to $154,957,000 at year-end 2016. The increase was primarily the result the Corporation's $12,004,000 in net income available for common shareholders less $4,559,000 of dividends paid to common shareholders for 2017. Information pertaining to preferred and common stock of the Corporation is disclosed in Note 10-Shareholders' Equity, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nRedemption of Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends\nAs previously disclosed, the Corporation participated in the U.S. Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Small Business Lending Fund Program (SBLF Program). Information about the SBLF Program is provided in Note 10-Shareholders' Equity, to the consolidated financial statements. Under the SBLF program, the Corporation originally issued $25,000,000, or 25,000 shares of non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock, Series B, $1,000 liquidation value, $2.50 par value to the Treasury.\nThe SBLF preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 regulatory capital and requires the payment of non-cumulative cash dividends quarterly on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. Preferred stock dividends for 2016 were $16,000, a decrease of $104,000 compared to $120,000 of preferred stock dividends in 2015. On February 18, 2016, Codorus Valley redeemed the remaining $12,000,000, or 12,000 shares of Series B preferred stock issued to the Treasury as reported on form 8-K filed on February 19, 2016. The annualized dividend rate on the preferred stock issued under the SBLF Program was 1 percent through the redemption date of February 18, 2016.\nDividends on Common Stock\nThe Corporation typically pays cash dividends on its common stock on a quarterly basis. The Board of Directors determines the dividend rate after considering the Corporation's capital requirements, current and projected net income, and other factors. Annual cash dividends per common share for the year 2017 totaled $0.516 per share, as adjusted for stock dividends, representing an increase of $0.044 or 9 percent above the cash dividends of $0.472, as adjusted, paid for the year 2016.\nPeriodically, the Corporation distributes stock dividends on its common stock. On December 12, 2017, the Corporation distributed a 5 percent common stock dividend to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 24, 2017. A 5 percent common stock dividend was also distributed in December 2016.\nCompensation Plans\nAs disclosed in this report, the Corporation maintains various employee and director benefit plans that could result in the issuance of its common stock or affect its earnings. Information regarding these plans can be found in Note 11-Benefit Plans and Note 12-Stock-Based Compensation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nCapital Ratios\nThe Corporation and PeoplesBank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators that involve quantitative guidelines and qualitative judgments. Quantitative measures established by regulators pertain to minimum capital ratios, as set forth in Table 9 below. The table provides a comparison of the Corporation's and PeoplesBank's risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios to the minimum regulatory requirement for the periods indicated.\nTable 9-Capital Ratios\n\n (1) Minimum amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2017 include the second year phase in of the capital conservation buffer of 1.25 percent required by the Basel III framework. At December 31, 2016, the minimum amounts and ratios included the first year phase in of the capital conservation buffer of 0.625 percent required by the Basel III framework. The conservation buffer is to be phased in over a four year period beginning January 1, 2016, with the full 2.5 percent required as of January 1, 2019. \n (2) Net unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, net of taxes, are disregarded for capital ratio computation purposes in accordance with federal regulatory banking guidelines. \nOn July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System finalized its rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework, which the FDIC adopted on July 9, 2013. Under the rule, minimum requirements will increase both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. Consistent with the Basel III framework, the rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent, and a common equity Tier 1 conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, that will apply to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4 percent to 6 percent, and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent for all banking organizations. The new rule also increases the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors. The rule for smaller, less complex institutions, including the Corporation and PeoplesBank, became effective January 1, 2015.\nThe new rule provides that, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer, which is to be phased in over a four year period beginning January 1, 2016, with the full 2.5 percent required as of January 1, 2019.\nThe transition schedule for new ratios, including the capital conservation buffer, is as follows:\n\nAs fully phased in, a banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5 percent would not be subject to limits on dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer less than 2.5 percent would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The new rule also prohibits a banking organization from making dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 percent as of the beginning of that quarter. Eligible net income is defined as net income for the 4 calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. A summary of payout restrictions based on the capital conservation buffer is as follows:\n\nThe Corporation's regulatory capital position at December 31, 2017 and 2016, as reflected in Table 9 above, reflects compliance with the new rule requirements that became effective January 1, 2015. The Corporation plans to manage its capital to ensure continued compliance.\nRisk Management\nThe Corporation's Enterprise Risk Management Committee ( Committee\u201d) meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and at least one independent director. The objective of the Committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the Corporation and its affiliates. While the Committee's risk review is broad in scope, its primary responsibility is to develop, implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures.\nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the possibility that a loan client, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms, posing one of the most significant risks of loss to the Corporation. Accordingly, the Corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk. To support this objective, a lending policy framework has been established which management believes is sound given the nature and scope of our operations. This framework includes seven basic policy parameters that guide the lending process and minimize risk:\n \u25cf The Corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures. \n \u25cf Lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount, loan type, level of risk, and loan officer experience. \n \u25cf Loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the Board level to review and approve loans that exceed pre-established dollar thresholds and/or meet other criteria. \n \u25cf The Corporation lends mainly within its primary geographical market area, including York County, Cumberland County, and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and Harford County, Baltimore County, Baltimore City and Carroll County, Maryland. Although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk, the diverse local economies and employee knowledge of our clients lessens this risk. \n \u25cf The loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single client or small group of related clients. \n \u25cf The Corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market, nor does it invest in securities backed by subprime mortgages. \n \u25cf The Corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein. \nThe Corporation uses loan-to-value ratios ( LTV ratios\u201d) for loan underwriting, establishing generally acceptable ratios of the loan amount to the value of the collateral securing the loan, to minimize the risk of future loss from the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017, the LTV ratios listed below were in effect.\n\nAn acceptable valuation is required on all real estate secured loans. Generally, an appraisal performed by an independent licensed appraiser is required for real estate secured loans under any of the following conditions:\n \u25cf loan amount is above $250,000; \n \u25cf or if the LTV is above 75 percent for commercial non-owner occupied property; \n \u25cf or if the LTV is above 80 percent for commercial owner occupied property; \n \u25cf or if the loan amount is greater than 90 percent of the tax assessed value for owner-occupied residential real estate in Pennsylvania; \n \u25cf or if the loan amount is greater than 90 percent of the tax assessed value for owner-occupied residential real estate in Maryland; \n \u25cf or if an existing appraisal is more than two years old (unless there was a material change in market conditions or the physical aspects of the property). \nExceptions to LTV ratios and the use of a licensed appraiser are sometimes made by management or the Board of Directors when there are compensating factors.\nOne component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations, defined as greater than 10 percent of the total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, the Corporation had three industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: commercial real estate investor represented 16.5 percent of the portfolio; residential real estate investor represented 15.0 percent of the portfolio; and builder and developer represented 13.2 percent of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had the same three industry concentrations that exceeded 10 percent of the total loan portfolio: commercial real estate investor, which represented 19.2 percent of the portfolio; residential real estate investor, which represented 14.4 percent of the portfolio; and builder & developer, which represented 11.7 percent of the portfolio. Loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate.\nIn addition to a comprehensive lending policy, numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year. These portfolios, or selected accounts therein, are also examined periodically by the Corporation's or PeoplesBank's regulators.\nNonperforming Assets\nTable 10 - Nonperforming Assets, below, presents a five-year history of asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss and related ratios.\nTable 10-Nonperforming Assets\n\nWhile the Corporation's loan portfolio has experienced strong growth over the years, Table 10 above reflects notable progress in reducing or maintaining the level of nonperforming assets. This has been accomplished through continuous collection efforts coordinated by the Corporation's General Counsel, recoveries from borrower payments and foreclosed real estate sales, the establishment of valuation allowances for selective accounts, and if necessary, loan charge-offs. In monitoring and managing nonperforming assets, we remain concerned about the impact of changing economic conditions, and the potential for adverse real estate market value changes, and the corresponding effects on commercial borrowers.\nNonperforming assets are reviewed by management on a monthly basis. We generally rely on appraisals performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of real estate collateral for impaired collateral-dependent loans. Generally, an appraisal is performed when: (i) an account reaches 90 days past due, unless a certified appraisal was completed within the past twelve months; (ii) market values have changed significantly; (iii) the condition of the property has changed significantly; or (iv) the existing appraisal is outdated based upon regulatory or policy requirements. In instances where the value of the collateral is less than the net carrying amount of the loan, a specific loss allowance is established for the difference by recording a loss provision to the income statement. When it is probable that some portion or all of the loan balance will not be collected, that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the nonperforming loan portfolio balance totaled $5,128,000, compared to $3,847,000 at year-end 2016. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due. The Corporation generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest income (i.e., recognizes interest income on a cash basis as long as the loan is sufficiently collateralized) when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due 90 days or more. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest represent loans that are contractually past due, but are well collateralized and in the process of collection. A loan is returned to interest accruing status when we determine that circumstances have improved to the extent that all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are current for at least six consecutive payments and future payments are reasonably assured. As of December 31, 2017, the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance totaled $5,052,000, compared to $3,114,000 at year-end 2016. The increase in nonaccrual loans resulted from reductions totaling $6,914,000 primarily principal repayments and charge-offs, which was offset by loans totaling $8,852,000 being placed on nonaccrual status. For both periods, the nonperforming loan portfolio balance was comprised primarily of collateralized commercial loans. For 2017, the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately $359,000. The amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for 2017 was approximately $164,000. The interest income recognized on impaired loans in Note 4-Loans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, is a higher amount because it includes interest income on all impaired loans, which includes nonaccrual loans, from the time the loan was impaired.\nForeclosed real estate represents real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to PeoplesBank and is included in the Other Assets category on the Corporation's balance sheet. The carrying amount of foreclosed real estate as of December 31, 2017, net of allowance, totaled $216,000, a decrease of $2,489,000 or 92 percent, compared to $2,705,000 at year-end 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of one property.\nTroubled debt restructurings pertain to loans whose terms have been modified to include a concession that we would not ordinarily consider due to the debtor's financial difficulties. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring typically involve a reduction of interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, the deferral of payments or extension of the stated maturity date. Troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment if they have been restructured during the most recent calendar year, or if they cease to perform in accordance with the modified terms. As of December 31, 2017, the accruing troubled debt restructuring portfolio balance totaled $3,344,000, compared to $3,664,000 at year-end 2016. The decrease was the result of principal payments made on loans within the troubled debt restructuring portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2017, there were $18,141,000 in additional potential problem loans being closely monitored by management. These additional potential problem loans consist of loans classified as substandard, reflecting an increased risk of the borrowers' ability to comply with present repayment terms. These loans are not classified as nonperforming and are not disclosed in Table 10. Comparatively, we were monitoring $11,979,000 of potential problem loans at December 31, 2016.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nAlthough the Corporation believes that it maintains sound credit policies, certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. The allowance is based upon management's continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis, which is subject to review and approval by the Board. An overview of the methodology and key factors that we use in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance and loan impairment is provided in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists primarily of three components: (i) specific allowances for individually impaired commercial loans; (ii) allowances calculated for pools of loans; and (iii) an unallocated component, which reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the assumptions that underlie the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The Corporation uses an internal risk rating system to evaluate individual loans. Loans are segmented into industry groups or pools with similar characteristics, and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on quantitative factors such as recent loss history (two-year rolling average of net charge-offs) and qualitative factors, such as the results of internal and external credit reviews, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, adequacy of collateral, and general economic conditions. Determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is subjective, particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods, and requires that we make estimates using assumptions. There is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance as a result of regulatory examinations.\nAn analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five-year period is presented in Table 11 - Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses, below. A more detailed analysis of the allowance for the current year is provided in Note 5 -Allowance for Loan Losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $16,689,000 or 1.19 percent of total loans, on December 31, 2017, compared to $14,992,000 and 1.18 percent, respectively, on December 31, 2016. The $1,697,000 or 11 percent increase in the allowance from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, was generally consistent with the $128,993,000 or 10 percent overall increase in loan growth (primarily commercial loans), net of deferred fees, over the same 12 month period.\nBased on our comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, and recognizing other relevant considerations including expected continued loan growth, continued uncertainty on certain larger criticized assets as legal and collection efforts continue, and the unknown impact of future accounting and regulatory requirements related to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, we believe that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2017.\nTable 11 -Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses\n\nTable 12 - Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses, below, presents a comparison of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for five year-end periods. While the Corporation attributes a portion of the allowance to individual loans and groups of loans that it evaluates and determines to be impaired, the allowance is available to cover all charge-offs that arise from the loan portfolio.\nTable 12-Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses\n\nAffecting our estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses are several considerations that are not specifically measureable through either specific loan impairment analyses, or portfolio-based historical losses. For example, we believe that we could face increasing credit risks and uncertainties, not yet reflected in current leading indicators, associated with prolonged low economic growth, or potential recessionary business conditions for certain industries or the broad economy, or the erosion of real estate values, any or all of which can adversely affect our borrowers' ability to service their loans.\nAdditionally, we have experienced continued strong commercial loan growth, including growth in newer markets where we have less of a loss history. Also, we recognize the inherent imprecision in any methodology for estimating specific and general loan losses, including the unpredictable timing and amounts of charge-offs and related historical loss averages, and specific-credit or broader portfolio future cash flow value and collateral valuation uncertainties which could negatively impact unimpaired portfolio loss factors. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, we maintained a 13 percent unallocated portion of our allowance for loan losses, similar to a 12 percent unallocated portion of the allowance as of December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity\nMaintaining adequate liquidity provides the Corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors, loan clients, employees, and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business. Additionally, it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise. Liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the Corporation's assets and liabilities. The primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows, funds received from client loan payments and, to a lesser degree, asset sales. The primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, included in this report, present the changes in cash from operating, investing and financing activities. At year-end 2017, we believe our liquidity was adequate based upon the potential liquidation of unpledged available-for-sale securities with a fair value totaling approximately $52,988,000 and available credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh totaling approximately $346,889,000. The Corporation's loan-to-deposit ratio was approximately 101 percent as of year-end 2017 and 2016. The ratio was flat as period end deposit growth was in line with loan growth in 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Corporation's financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. These commitments consist primarily of commitments to grant new loans, unfunded commitments under existing loan facilities, and letters of credit issued under the same standards as on-balance sheet instruments. Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk are disclosed in Note 14-Commitments to Extend Credit, to the consolidated financial statements, and totaled $508,575,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to $449,178,000 at December 31, 2016. Generally, these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes. Accordingly, many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and, therefore, generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the Corporation or PeoplesBank.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the amount and timing of payments due under long-term contractual obligations.\nTable 13-Contractual Obligations\n\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity-to-assets ratio. Inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses, which tend to rise during periods of general inflation. The level of inflation can be measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers (December vs. December). The change in the CPI for 2017 and 2016 was 2.1 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for 2015.\nManagement believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the Corporation's ability to react to changes in market interest rates. Management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, management is focused on increasing fee income, an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates.", "item_7_tables": "Table 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>
