MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand Crawford & Company, our operations, and our business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As described in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of those accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, financial results from our operations outside of the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, and certain subsidiaries in the Philippines, are reported and consolidated on a two-month delayed basis in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, \"Consolidation,\" in order to provide sufficient time for accumulation of their results. Accordingly, the Company's December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 consolidated financial statements include the financial position of such operations as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal periods ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nBusiness Overview\nBased in Atlanta, Georgia, Crawford & Company (www.crawfordandcompany.com) is one of the world's largest independent providers of claims management solutions to the risk management and insurance industry, as well as to self-insured entities, with an expansive global network serving clients in more than 70 countries. The Crawford SolutionSM offers comprehensive, integrated claims services, business process outsourcing and consulting services for major product lines including property and casualty claims management, workers' compensation claims and medical management, and legal settlement administration.\nShares of the Company's two classes of common stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbols CRDA and CRDB, respectively. The Company's two classes of stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting rights and the Company's ability to pay greater cash dividends on the non-voting Class A Common Stock than on the voting Class B Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. In addition, with respect to mergers or similar transactions, holders of Class A Common Stock must receive the same type and amount of consideration as holders of Class B Common Stock, unless different consideration is approved by the holders of 75% of the Class A Common Stock, voting as a class.\nAs discussed in more detail in subsequent sections of this MD&A, we have four operating segments: U.S. Services, International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group. Our four operating segments represent components of our Company for which separate financial information is available, and which is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company realigned two of its reportable segments by moving its Canada and Latin America/Caribbean operations from the former Americas segment to the newly formed International segment, previously referred to as the EMEA/AP (Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific) segment. The former Americas segment, without Canada and Latin America/Caribbean, is now the U.S. Services segment. The results of the former EMEA/AP and Americas segments are no longer reported separately. U.S. Services primarily serves the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. International serves the property and casualty insurance company and self-insurance markets outside the U.S. Broadspire serves the U.S. self-insurance marketplace. Garden City Group serves the class action, regulatory, mass tort, bankruptcy, and other legal administration markets, primarily in the U.S. The results of prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation of our reportable segments. The change in reporting segments did not have any impact on previously reported consolidated financial results.\nInsurance companies, which represent the major source of our global revenues, customarily manage their own claims administration function but often rely on third parties for certain services which we provide, primarily field investigation and the evaluation of property and casualty insurance claims. We are also experiencing increased utilization by insurance companies of the managed repair network provided by our Contractor Connection division.\nSelf-insured entities typically rely on us for a broader range of services. In addition to field investigation and claims evaluation, we may also provide initial loss reporting services for their claimants, loss mitigation services such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation, risk management information services, and trust fund administration to pay their claims.\nWe also perform legal settlement administration services related to securities, product liability, and other class action settlements and bankruptcies, including identifying and qualifying class members, determining and dispensing settlement payments, and administering settlement funds.\nThe global claims management services market is highly competitive and comprised of a large number of companies of varying size and that offer a varied scope of services. The demand from insurance companies and self-insured entities for services provided by independent claims service firms like us is largely dependent on industry-wide claims volumes, which are affected by, among other things, the insurance underwriting cycle, weather-related events, general economic activity, overall employment levels, and workplace injury rates. Demand is also impacted by decisions insurance companies and self-insured entities may make with respect to the level of claims outsourced to independent claim service firms as opposed to those handled by their own in-house claims adjusters. In addition, our ability to retain clients and maintain or increase case referrals is also dependent in part on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, competitively priced services and effective sales efforts.\nWe typically earn our revenues on an individual fee-per-claim basis for claims management services we provide to insurance companies and self-insured entities. Accordingly, the volume of claim referrals to us is a key driver of our revenues. Generally, fees are earned on cases as services are provided, which generally occurs in the period the case is assigned to us, although sometimes a portion or substantially all of the revenues generated by a specific case assignment will be earned in subsequent periods. We cannot predict the future trend of case volumes for a number of reasons, including the frequency and severity of weather-related cases and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of cases for us and are not subject to accurate forecasting.\nThe legal settlement administration market within which our Garden City Group segment operates is also highly competitive but is comprised of a smaller number of specialized entities. The demand for legal settlement administration services is generally not directly tied to or affected by the insurance underwriting cycle. The demand for these services is largely dependent on the volume of securities and product liability class action settlements, the volume of bankruptcy filings and the resulting settlements, volume of mass torts and general economic conditions. Our revenues for legal settlement administration services are largely project-based and we earn these revenues as we perform individual tasks and deliver the outputs as outlined in each project.\nOn December 1, 2014, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of GAB Robins, a loss adjusting and claims management provider headquartered in the U.K. which reports through our International segment. We believe the GAB Robins acquisition enables Crawford to significantly expand its claims handling business across a wide range of product lines in the U.K. and bolster its global specialty lines claims business. The success of the GAB Robins acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies and cost savings from integrating GAB Robins on a timely basis. The integration process continues to be complex, costly, and time-consuming, and no assurances of the success of the process can be provided. Because the financial results of certain of our international subsidiaries, including those in the U.K. through which GAB Robins reports, are included in our consolidated financial statements on a two-month delayed basis as described above, the results of GAB Robins' business are included in our consolidated results of operations beginning February 1, 2015. In addition, the $78.4 million in Credit Facility borrowings used to complete the GAB Robins acquisition were not included in outstanding borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014, because the U.K.-based borrowing entity has an October 31 fiscal year end, and the balance sheet of that entity was consolidated as of October 31, 2014.\nIn 2014, we established a wholly-owned global business services center in Manila, Philippines. We have subsequently expanded the capabilities of the center to include Information Technology services performed in Pune, India (the \"Centers\"). The Centers provide us venues for global consolidation of certain business functions, shared services, and currently outsourced processes. The Centers, which are expected to be phased in through 2018, are expected to allow us to continue to strengthen our client service, realize additional operational efficiencies, and invest in new capabilities for growth. Operations in the Centers are expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of approximately $60 million through 2019 and annual cost savings of approximately $20 million per year thereafter. To achieve these savings, we expect to record charges totaling approximately $20 million through 2018. An initial charge of $4.4 million was incurred in 2015, which was partially offset by initial savings in 2015 of approximately $2 million. We expect to record charges of $8.4 million in 2016, which should be partially offset by combined savings in 2016 of $8 million. No assurances can be provided of our ability to timely or cost effectively complete and ramp up operations at the Centers, or to achieve expected cost savings on a timely basis, or at all.\nIn 2015 we also announced various restructuring plans intended to, among other things, reduce overhead costs in certain functions and in our business segments, and streamline senior management to reduce costs and further improve execution. These plans included integration costs related to the GAB Robins acquisition and other special charges discussed in Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring and special charges associated with these plans totaled $30.0 million in 2015, and another $7.2 million of costs are expected in 2016.\nGoodwill impairment charges for 2015 were $49.3 million. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2014 or 2013. See Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\" and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about the 2015 goodwill impairment charges.\nResults of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated revenues before reimbursements were $1.170 billion in 2015, an increase of 2.4% compared with $1.143 billion in 2014. Net loss attributable to Crawford & Company was $(45.5) million in 2015, compared with net income of $30.6 million in 2014 and $51.0 million in 2013. During 2015, the Company recorded restructuring and special charges of $34.4 million. The Company also recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million in 2015. There were no similar charges in 2014 or 2013.\nSegment operating earnings (a measure of segment operating performance used by our management that is defined and discussed in more detail below) improved in our U.S. Services and Broadspire segments from 2013 to 2014 and from 2014 to 2015, while we experienced operating earnings declines in our International and Garden City Group segments in those periods.\nCompared with 2014, our consolidated revenues before reimbursements were 2.4% higher in 2015 due primarily to revenue growth in U.S. Services and Broadspire, and the GAB Robins acquisition in International, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, and lower revenues at Garden City Group.\nIn the U.S. Services segment, operating earnings improved from 2014 to 2015 due to continued growth in our U.S. Contractor Connection managed repair network, growth in U.S. Catastrophe Services primarily due to an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, and cost reduction initiatives in 2015. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in weather related cases in the U.S. Claims Field Operations in 2015.\nOperating earnings in our International segment declined in 2015 compared to 2014, due to a reduction in weather-related claim activity and decline in high-frequency, low-complexity claims in the U.K. and Asia-Pacific in 2015, and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nBroadspire's operating earnings improved each year from 2013 to 2015. The improvements were due to higher revenues from both new and existing clients, and improved control over operating expenses.\nAs expected, Garden City Group's operating earnings declined in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting a decline in revenues from certain special projects. The Garden City Group had lower revenues in 2015 from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project and another non-Gulf related special project, compared with 2014. Operating earnings were higher in this segment in both 2014 and 2013, compared with 2015, due to these special projects.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were 1.6% higher in 2015 than in 2014 and 2.4% higher in 2014 than in 2013. The increase in 2015 was attributable to increases in SG&A expenses from the GAB Robins acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. The increase in 2014 was due to an increase in acquisition-related costs, professional fees and self-insurance expense, partially offset by a decrease in short-term and long-term incentive compensation costs.\nSegment Operating Earnings of our Operating Segments\nWe believe that a discussion and analysis of the segment operating earnings of our four operating segments is helpful in understanding the results of our operations. Operating earnings is our segment measure of profitability as discussed in Note 13, \"Segment and Geographic Information,\" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by our senior management and CODM to evaluate the financial performance of our operating segments and make resource allocation decisions.\nWe believe operating earnings is a measure that is useful to others in that it allows them to evaluate segment operating performance using the same criteria used by our senior management and CODM. Segment operating earnings represent segment earnings, including the direct and indirect costs of certain administrative functions required to operate our business but excludes unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, goodwill impairment, restructuring and special charges, income taxes, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nFor most of our international operations and for Garden City Group, many administrative functions, such as finance, human resources, information technology, quality and compliance, are embedded in those locations and are considered direct costs of those operations. For our domestic operations (primarily Broadspire and the U.S. Services segments), we have a centralized shared-services arrangement for most of these administrative functions, and we allocate the costs of those services to the segments as indirect costs based on usage. Although some of the administrative services in our shared-services center benefit, and are allocated to, more than one of our operating segments, the majority of these shared services are allocated to the Broadspire and U.S. Services segments.\nIncome taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, and amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets are recurring components of our net income, but they are not considered part of our segment operating earnings because they are managed on a corporate-wide basis. Income taxes are calculated for the Company on a consolidated basis based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which we provide services, and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Net corporate interest expense results from capital structure decisions made by senior management and the Board of Directors and affecting the Company as a whole. Stock option expense represents the non-cash costs generally related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan expenses which are not allocated to our operating segments. Amortization expense is a non-cash expense for customer-relationship intangible assets acquired in business combinations. None of these costs relate directly to the performance of our services or operating activities and, therefore, are excluded from segment operating earnings in order to better assess the results of each segment's operating activities on a consistent basis.\nAlthough associated with particular operating segments, goodwill impairment charges are not allocated to any particular segment since they do not impact our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance.\nRestructuring and special charges arise from time to time from events (such as internal restructurings, losses on subleases, arbitration awards, and debt refinancings) that are not allocated to any particular segment since they historically have not regularly impacted our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance on a regular basis.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits represent expenses and credits related to our chief executive officer and Board of Directors, certain provisions for bad debt allowances or subsequent recoveries such as those related to bankrupt clients, defined benefit pension costs or credits for our frozen U.S. pension plan, and certain self-insurance costs and recoveries that are not allocated to our individual operating segments.\nAdditional discussion and analysis of our income taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, goodwill impairment, restructuring and special charges follows the discussion and analysis of the results of operations of our four operating segments.\nSegment Revenues\nIn the normal course of business, our operating segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by our clients. Under GAAP, these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are required to be included when reporting expenses and revenues, respectively, in our consolidated results of operations. In the discussion and analysis of results of operations which follows, we do not include a gross up of expenses and revenues for these pass-through reimbursed expenses. The amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in our results of operations with no impact to our net income or operating earnings. A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to consolidated revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is self-evident from the face of the accompanying statements of income. Unless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses.\nSegment Expenses\nOur discussion and analysis of segment operating expenses is comprised of two components. \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\".\n\"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits provided to the employees of each segment, as well as payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff in each segment. As a service company, these costs represent our most significant and variable operating expenses. In our International and Garden City Group segments, these costs include direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits of certain administrative functions that are embedded in those locations and are considered direct operating costs of those locations. In our U.S. Services and Broadspire operations, certain administrative functions are performed by centralized headquarters staff. These costs are considered indirect and are not included in \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\". Accordingly, the \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" components are not comparable across segments, but are comparable within each segment across periods.\nThe allocated indirect costs of our shared-services infrastructure are included in \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" In addition to allocated corporate and shared costs, \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes travel and entertainment, office rent and occupancy costs, automobile expenses, office operating expenses, data processing costs, cost of risk, professional fees, and amortization and depreciation expense other than amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets.\nUnless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses and expense amounts exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nOperating results for our segments reconciled to income before income taxes and net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company, are as shown in the following table.\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

31, 2014\nU.S. SERVICES SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings for our U.S. Services segment increased from $18.0 million in 2014 to $32.7 million in 2015, representing an operating margin of 13.5% in 2015 compared with 8.4% in 2014. Operating earnings improved 81.3% from 2014 to 2015 due to an increase in revenues and the impact of cost reduction initiatives in 2015.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues are primarily generated from the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. U.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>28,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>76,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>183,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>59,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in U.S. Claims Services revenues in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to an increase in revenues in the U.S. Catastrophe Services service line resulting from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. Claims Field Operations service line revenues due to a reduction of weather-related case volumes. The outsourcing project resulted in $51.3 million in revenues in 2015, compared with $22.1 million in 2014, responsible for a 13.6% positive variance in revenues for 2015 compared with 2014. The variance in revenues was negatively impacted by approximately $4.5 million, or 2.1% of 2014 revenues, as a result of the January 1, 2015 transfer of affinity claims which are now handled by our Broadspire segment. There was also an increase in revenues in the U.S. Technical Services service line due to an increase in case volumes in 2015. Changes in the overall mix of services provided and rates charged for those services increased revenues by approximately 3.9% in 2015 compared with 2014. All of these factors netted to positively impact revenues, before the impact from the decrease in cases discussed below.\nU.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased 17.4% in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the ongoing expansion of this service as an alternative property claims service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks. There was also an increase in the average fee per claim in 2015 compared to 2014.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $8.2 million in 2015, decreasing from $9.6 million in 2014. The decrease in reimbursements is related to the reduction in revenues in U.S. Claims Field Operations. The outsourcing project in U.S. Claims Services discussed above was a primary source of the 2015 revenue increase but does not have reimbursed expenses.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>148,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>219,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>7,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>32,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>187,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>194,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Cases Received\n</td> <td>382,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2015 decrease in U.S. Claims Services cases was primarily due to the transfer of affinity claims to our Broadspire segment, and fewer cases in our U.S. Claims Field Operations service line due to a reduction in weather-related activity and a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity vehicle appraisals. Approximately 39,000 affinity cases were included in U.S. Claims Field Operations cases received in 2014. The previously described outsourcing project involved the Company providing adjusters to work on the client's premises; accordingly, there are no associated case volumes referred to the Company for these revenues. The increases in U.S. Technical Services and U.S. Catastrophe Services were due to cases received from new clients in 2015. Excluding the affinity cases from the 2014 case volumes, the decrease in U.S. Services cases received would have been 2.8% for 2015 compared with 2014.\nThe 2015 increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases was due to the ongoing expansion of our contractor network and to the continued trend of insurance carriers moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to our contractor managed repair networks, which we expect to continue.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our U.S. Services segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and the payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff. U.S. Services direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, was 61.8% for 2015 and 62.2% for 2014. The decrease was due to the impact of certain cost reduction initiatives in 2015 and improved staff utilization.\nThe dollar amount of these expenses increased from $133.9 million in 2014 to $149.7 million in 2015. There was an average of 1,489 FTEs (including 454 catastrophe adjusters) in 2015 compared with an average of 1,403 FTEs (including 317 catastrophe adjusters) in 2014. The increase in expenses and FTEs in 2015 was primarily due to the higher compensation costs required to service the outsourcing project referred to above.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nU.S. Services segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased from $63.4 million in 2014 to $60.0 million in 2015, and as a percent of segment revenues, decreased from 29.4% in 2014 to 24.7% in 2015. These decreases were primarily due to the impact of a reduction of office locations in the U.S. and related administrative cost reductions.\nINTERNATIONAL SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nInternational segment operating earnings decreased to $18.8 million in 2015, a decrease of 25.8% from 2014 operating earnings of $25.3 million. The operating margin decreased from 5.2% in 2014 to 3.7% in 2015. The decline in operating earnings was due to a reduction in weather-related claim activity and a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity claims in the U.K. and Asia-Pacific in 2015, and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe results for GAB Robins were not included in the International results for the year ended December 31, 2014, as the acquisition occurred after the October 31, 2014 fiscal year end of our U.K. subsidiaries.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nInternational revenues are primarily derived from the property and casualty insurance company markets, with additional revenues from the self-insured markets in the U.K., Canada, Asia-Pacific (which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Middle East and Africa) and Europe and Rest of World (which together consist of continental Europe and Latin America). Revenues before reimbursements by major region were as follows:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>110,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>107,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>102,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues before reimbursements from our International segment totaled $506.7 million in 2015, compared to $488.3 million in 2014. Overall case volumes in the International segment increased 2.2% in 2015 compared with 2014. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our International segment revenues by $62.1 million, or approximately 12.7% for 2015 compared with 2014. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 5.0% revenue decrease for 2015 compared with 2014, before the impact of the increase from GAB Robins revenues and cases.\nThe increase in revenues in the U.K. for 2015 compared with 2014 was due to the acquisition of GAB Robins, which accounted for $79.9 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, or a 16.4% positive variance in segment revenues for 2015 compared with 2014. Excluding the impact of the GAB Robins acquisition and exchange rate fluctuations, revenues in the U.K. declined to $114.9 million in 2015 due to a continued decline in the general property market as well as a general decline in high-frequency, low-complexity cases.\nThe lower revenues in Canada were primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Canadian dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, revenues in Canada would have been $127.5 million in 2015, a 1.3% decrease from 2014 due to a slight decline in weather-related cases.\nRevenues decreased in Asia-Pacific due to the negative impact from exchange rates and a reduction in high volume, low complexity cases in Singapore and China, partially offset by an increase in weather-related activity in Australia in 2015. On a constant-dollar basis, revenues in Asia-Pacific would have been $122.0 million in 2015, a 9.2% increase over 2014, due primarily to an increase in weather-related cases in Australia.\nThe lower revenues in Europe and Rest of World were also primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant-dollar basis, revenues in Europe and Rest of World would have been $124.2 million in 2015, a 4.5% increase from 2014, due primarily to expanding insurer contracts in Scandinavia.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our International segment which are included in total Company revenues decreased to $30.3 million in 2015 from $30.9 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in claims from weather-related activity in the U.K., largely offset by reimbursements from cases associated with the GAB Robins acquisition and increased cases due to weather-related events in Australia.\nCase Volume Analysis\nInternational case volumes by region for 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>129,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>181,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>150,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>318,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>331,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Cases Received\n</td> <td>779,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>762,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall case volumes were 2.2% higher in 2015 compared with 2014. The U.K. case volumes include the impact of the GAB Robins acquisition, which accounted for 54,100 cases in 2015. Excluding the acquisition, U.K. case volumes were down 14.7% as compared with 2014, primarily due to a continued decline in the general property market as well as a general decline in high-frequency, low-complexity cases. The decrease in Canada cases was primarily due to a decline in weather related cases from existing clients compared with 2014. The decrease in Asia-Pacific cases was due to a decline in high-frequency, low-complexity cases in Singapore and China, partially offset by an increase in weather-related cases in Australia. The decrease in case volumes in Europe and Rest of World was primarily due to a reduction in high-frequency, low-complexity cases in Brazil where we are exiting the affinity, mass market, and vehicle services lines in that country, partially offset by increases in European operations in Spain, Germany, and Scandinavia, due to expanding insurer contracts. Excluding the cases from the GAB Robins acquisition, International cases received would have decreased 4.9% for 2015 compared with 2014.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nDirect compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor, as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, decreased from 69.6% in 2014 to 66.5% in 2015. The percentage decrease primarily reflected changes in the mix of services provided. Excluding the impact of the GAB Robins contractor repair revenue, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expenses would have been 71.0% of segment revenues in 2015. This increase is due to reduced utilization of our U.K. staff in 2015 and the impact of the GAB Robins integration. The dollar amount of these expenses decreased in 2015 by $2.9 million due to cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015 and changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased costs from the GAB Robins acquisition. There was an average of 4,690 International FTEs in 2015, an increase from 4,294 FTEs in 2014 due to an increase in the U.K. from the GAB Robins acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in FTEs in Canada, Asia-Pacific, and Europe and Rest of World.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nAs a component of our acquisition of GAB Robins, the Company acquired a contractor repair business where we are the principal in the relationship with clients. As the principal in this business, both revenues and the corresponding contractor costs are reported at gross values. These contractor expenses are recorded within \"Expenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" They are reported in this category instead of \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor,\" as the services performed by these outside contractors are not services that can be performed by our workforce.\nExpenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor increased as a percent of International segment revenues before reimbursements, from 25.2% in 2014 to 29.8% in 2015, and the dollar amount of these expenses increased by $27.8 million. The increases in both amount and percentage is primarily due to the impact of the GAB Robins acquisition in the U.K., including the acquired contractor repair business discussed above. Excluding the increase from the GAB Robins contractor repair business, expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits & non-employee labor would have been 24.8% of revenues in 2015. This variance is due to cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015.\nBROADSPIRE SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nBroadspire recorded operating earnings of $24.0 million in 2015, or 8.2% of revenues, compared with operating earnings of $15.5 million in 2014, or 5.8% of revenues. Operating earnings improved from 2014 to 2015 due to higher revenues and improved control over operating expenses.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nBroadspire segment revenues are primarily derived from workers' compensation, disability, and liability claims management, medical management services, such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation for workers' compensation, and risk management information services provided to the U.S. self-insured marketplace. Beginning January 1, 2015, the affinity business previously handled by our U.S. Claims Services service line in the U.S. Services segment was rebranded as accident and health services and is now in our Broadspire segment. These revenues were $5.4 million in 2015, and are included in the workers' compensation, disability, and liability claims management service line. Broadspire revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Management\n</td> <td>156,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Management Information Services\n</td> <td>14,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBroadspire segment revenues before reimbursements increased 9.0% to $293.0 million in 2015 compared with $268.9 million in 2014. The overall increase in 2015 revenues compared with 2014 was primarily due to organic growth, new clients, higher client retention, the transfer of accident and health cases from our U.S. Claims Services service line in the U.S. Services segment, and increased medical management services referrals. The transfer of accident and health cases from our U.S. Claims Services service line accounted for 2.0% of the revenue increase from 2014 to 2015.\nRevenues were positively impacted by unit volumes for the Broadspire segment, measured principally by cases received, which increased 21.9% from 2014 to 2015, of which 18.0% of the increase was due to the transfer of accident and health cases from the U.S. Services segment. This increase was also due to changes in the mix of services provided and in the rates charged for those services, which increased revenues by approximately 3.1% in 2015, net of the impact of the high-frequency, low-complexity accident and health revenues and cases.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Broadspire segment which are included in total Company revenues were $4.2 million in 2015, increasing slightly from $3.9 million in 2014 due to the growth in revenues.\nCase Volume Analysis\nBroadspire unit volumes by major underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation\n</td> <td>175,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty\n</td> <td>145,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>117,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Cases Received\n</td> <td>439,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2015 decrease in workers' compensation cases primarily resulted from the loss of one account responsible for 7,600 cases in 2014. The increase in casualty cases in 2015 compared with 2014 was partially due to new clients and from the handling of approximately 64,800 accident and health cases in 2015, which in prior periods were handled by our U.S. Claims Services service line in the U.S. Services segment. Excluding these accident and health cases, the increase in Broadspire cases received from 2014 to 2015 would have been 3.9%. The 2015 increase in other cases was primarily due to increased referrals to our medical management services from both new and existing clients.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nThe most significant expense in our Broadspire segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and the payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. Broadspire direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, decreased to 54.3% in 2015 compared with 55.7% in 2014. The decline as a percent of revenues was due to improved employee utilization. The amount of these expenses increased from $149.7 million in 2014 to $159.2 million in 2015 due to the growth in revenues. Average FTEs totaled 1,910 in 2015, up from 1,697 FTEs in 2014. The increase in employees was due to the conversion of certain outsourced contractors to full time employees in the Center and the transfer of employees handling accident and health cases from the U.S. Services segment.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nBroadspire segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements to 37.5% in 2015 from 38.5% in 2014. This decrease was due to expense growth being less than the growth in revenues in 2015. Total 2015 expenses increased by $6.2 million compared with 2014, due to the growth in revenues.\nGARDEN CITY GROUP SEGMENT\nGarden City Group revenues in 2015 declined compared with prior year levels primarily because of lower revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement special project and another non-gulf related project. We expect activity on these projects to continue in 2016, although at further reduced rates.\nOperating Earnings\nOur Garden City Group segment reported 2015 operating earnings of $11.5 million, decreasing 49.6% from $22.8 million in 2014, with the related operating margin decreasing from 13.4% in 2014 to 9.0% in 2015. The changes in the operating margin were primarily the result of changes in the mix of services provided and the winding down of the major gulf-related special project.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nGarden City Group revenues are primarily derived from legal settlement administration services related to securities, product liability, other class action settlements, and bankruptcies, primarily in the U.S. Garden City Group revenues are project-based and can fluctuate significantly primarily due to the timing of projects awarded. Garden City Group revenues before reimbursements decreased 24.7% to $128.2 million in 2015, compared with $170.3 million in 2014. The decrease in Garden City Group revenues was due primarily to the reduction in activity from the special projects discussed above.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had an estimated revenue backlog related to projects awarded totaling $81.0 million, compared with $102.0 million at December 31, 2014. Of the $81.0 million backlog at December 31, 2015, approximately $69.4 million is expected to be included in revenues within the next 12 months.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nThe nature and volume of work performed in our Garden City Group segment typically requires more reimbursable out-of-pocket expenditures than our other operating segments. Reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Garden City Group segment, which are included in total Company revenues, may vary materially from year to year depending on the amount and types of projects and were $28.4 million in 2015, decreasing from $29.7 million in 2014. This decrease was due to a lower volume of case administration work for settlements in 2015.\nTransaction Volume\nGarden City Group services are generally project-based and not denominated by individual claims. Depending upon the nature of projects and their respective stages of completion, the volume of transactions or tasks performed by us in any period can vary, sometimes significantly.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group direct compensation expense, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expenses, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, increased to 70.5% in 2015 compared with 69.1% in 2014. The increase as a percent of revenues was due to lower employee utilization in 2015 as a result of the reduced revenues. The dollar amount of related expenses declined to $90.4 million in 2015 compared with $117.6 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with the further reduction in revenues from the special projects discussed above. There was an average of 709 FTEs in 2015, compared with an average of 805 in 2014, decreasing due to the decreased revenues.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased 11.6% to $26.3 million in 2015 from $29.8 million in 2014, but increased as a percent of related segment revenues before reimbursements to 20.5% in 2015 from 17.5% in 2014. The dollar amount of these expenses decreased due to reduced activity associated with the reduction in revenues in 2015. The increase in expenses as a percent of revenues before reimbursements was due to the reduction in variable expenses being less than the reduction in revenues in 2015. During 2014, we reduced a contingent consideration liability from a previous acquisition by $2.0 million after concluding the consideration would not be paid. We also impaired and expensed the $1.3 million net book value of a customer list obtained in that acquisition during 2014.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013\nU.S. SERVICES SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings for our U.S. Services segment increased from $11.9 million in 2013 to $18.0 million in 2014, representing an operating margin of 8.4% in 2014 compared with 5.8% in 2013. The operating earnings increase of 51.7% from 2013 to 2014 was due to continued growth in our U.S. Contractor Connection managed repair network, and an increase in revenues in the U.S. Catastrophe Services service line resulting from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier. These increases were partially offset by the reduction in earnings due to a reduction in weather related cases in the U.S. from superstorm Sandy.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>24,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>43,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>164,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>50,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013, revenues were positively impacted by segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, which increased by 5.3% during this period. In addition, an overall favorable change in the mix of services provided and in the rates charged for those services also increased revenues by approximately 0.3% in 2014 compared with 2013.\nThe decline in revenues in U.S. Claims Services primarily resulted from a lack of major weather-related events in 2014 and a reduction in workers' compensation cases (which are now handled solely by our Broadspire segment), partially offset by increased revenues in our U.S. Catastrophe Services service line from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier. The overall decline in U.S. Claims Services revenue was offset by increases in revenues from U.S. Contractor Connection. U.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased due to the ongoing expansion of this service as an alternative property claims service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks. U.S. Contractor Connection revenues were also positively impacted by a price increase that was effective on July 1, 2013, which is reflected in all of 2014.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $9.6 million in 2014, decreasing from $19.8 million in 2013. The decrease in 2014 was due to higher expenses incurred in 2013 related to handling superstorm Sandy cases.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>219,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>199,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>5,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>22,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>247,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>184,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Cases Received\n</td> <td>432,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>410,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2014 increase in U.S. Claims Services cases was primarily due to an increase in high-frequency, low-complexity affinity cases, which more than offset the reduction in weather-related cases and the internal transfer of workers' compensation cases. The previously described 2014 outsourcing project involved the Company providing adjusters to work on the client's premises; accordingly, there are no associated case volumes referred to the Company in 2014 for these revenues. The 2014 increase in U.S. Contractor Connection cases was due to the ongoing expansion of our contractor network and to the continued trend in the insurance industry of shifting to managed repair networks as an alternative property claims solution for high-frequency, low-complexity property cases. The increases in high-frequency, low-complexity automotive, property, and affinity cases resulted in a reduced average fee per case within the region compared to 2013.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nU.S. Services direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, was 62.2% for 2014 and 64.9% for 2013. The decrease was due to improved staff utilization.\nThe dollar amount of these expenses increased from $132.3 million in 2013 to $133.9 million in 2014. This increase was due to an increase in staff to handle the growth in revenues. There was an average of 1,403 FTEs (including 317 catastrophe adjusters) in 2014 compared with an average of 1,388 (including 197 catastrophe adjusters) in 2013.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nU.S. Services expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor increased from $59.8 million in 2013 to $63.4 million in 2014, primarily due to increases in centralized administrative costs, amortization for internally developed software and self-insured professional liability expenses. The remaining increase was due to the continued investment in the start-up operations of our Specialty Markets service line, and increases related to U.S. Contractor Connection due to the growth in revenues.\nINTERNATIONAL SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nInternational operating earnings decreased to $25.3 million in 2014, a decrease of 34.7% from 2013 operating earnings of $38.8 million. The operating margin decreased from 7.9% in 2013 to 5.2% in 2014. The decline in operating earnings was principally due to increased expenses in 2014 related to the continued investment in the start-up operations of our Specialty Markets service line. This was partially offset by higher revenues and operating earnings in Canada due to the impact of case volume increases resulting from business growth in 2014 from both insurer markets and our expanding Canadian Contractor Connection managed repair network. The decline in International operating earnings was also due to the inclusion in 2013 of revenues and operating earnings from claims handling activity originating from the 2011 Thailand floods, flooding and bush fires in Australia, and a $900,000 performance bonus from a client in Europe. Also negatively impacting operating earnings comparisons was a $2.3 million gain from the sale of the rights to a customer contract in Latin America in 2013, compared to a $0.4 million gain from the contingent consideration provision of the same agreement during 2014.\nThe results for GAB Robins were not included in the International results for the year ended December 31, 2014, as the acquisition occurred after the October 31, 2014 fiscal year end of our U.K. subsidiaries.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nInternational revenues before reimbursements by major region were as follows:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>129,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>111,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>118,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues before reimbursements from our International segment totaled $488.3 million in 2014, compared to $488.5 million in 2013. Compared with 2013, the U.S. dollar was stronger in 2014 against most major international currencies, resulting in a negative impact from exchange rate movements of $9.2 million, or 1.9%, of segment revenues from 2013 to 2014. Excluding the negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations, International revenues would have been $497.5 million in 2014, reflecting an increase in revenues on a constant dollar basis of 1.8%.\nU.K. revenues increased due to increases in winter weather-related cases, increased revenues from the Specialty Markets service line, and foreign exchange gains.\nThe revenue increase in Canada was primarily due to an increase in cases received from both new and existing clients, market share increases in 2014, and growth in Canada's Contractor Connection service line. There was also an increase in desk-adjusted case assignments in both corporate self-insured and insurer markets in the current year.\nThe decrease in revenues in Asia-Pacific was due to the disposal of our South African subsidiary and an expected decline in fees for the ongoing handling of cases resulting from the 2011 Thailand flooding event. Claims handling associated with the Thailand flooding event was substantially completed during 2013. There was also a decline in revenues in Australia due to flooding and bush fire activity in 2013, partially offset by an increase in weather-related activity in the Philippines in 2014.\nThe increase in revenues in Europe and Rest of World for 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to increased business in Scandinavia in 2014, partially offset by the inclusion in 2013 of a $900,000 performance bonus from a client in Europe.\nInternational unit volume, measured by cases received, increased 11.3% in 2014 compared with 2013, and increased 10.8% when cases from our South African subsidiary are removed from 2013 for comparison purposes. Revenues decreased by 8.6% from changes in the mix of services provided and in the rates charged for those services, primarily due to the decline in Thailand revenues and the additional high-frequency, low-complexity case volumes in Europe and Rest of World, net of increases in the U.K. and Canada. The disposal of our South African subsidiary reduced revenue by 1.6%, while revenues resulting from the 2013 acquisition of Lloyd Warwick International Limited and the 2014 acquisition of Buckley Scott Holdings Limited increased revenues by 1.2%.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our International segment which are included in total Company revenues decreased to $30.9 million in 2014 from $33.4 million in 2013. Reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses were higher in 2013 because of the increased expenses associated with handling the Thailand flood cases.\nCase Volume Analysis\nInternational unit volumes by region for 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K.\n</td> <td>88,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>184,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>158,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe and Rest of World\n</td> <td>331,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>291,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International Cases Received\n</td> <td>762,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cases received in the U.K. was primarily due to a continued decline in the general property market as well as a general decline in high-frequency, low-complexity cases.\nThe 2014 increase in cases in Canada was primarily due to increases in high-frequency, low-complexity automotive and affinity cases. Our Canada operations also experienced an increase in market share in 2014 compared with 2013, growth in the Contractor Connection business, and growth in its desk-adjusted case assignments in both corporate self-insured and insurer markets.\nAsia-Pacific overall case volumes increased due to increases in high-frequency, low-complexity motor and property cases in China and Malaysia.\nThe increase in Europe and Rest of World cases, especially in Sweden, Norway and Spain, was primarily due to expanding insurer contracts. There were also increases in high-frequency, low-complexity automotive and property cases in Brazil, which resulted in a reduced average fee per case within the region compared to the prior year.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nAs a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, direct compensation expenses, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor increased to 69.6% in 2014 from 68.2% in 2013, and the dollar amount of these expenses increased in 2014 by $6.9 million. These increases primarily reflected changes in the mix of services provided and lower utilization of our staff within Asia-Pacific after the Thailand flood claims work was completed. There was an average of 4,294 International FTEs in 2014, a decrease from 4,332 in 2013 primarily due to a decline in FTEs in the U.K.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nExpenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor increased as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements from 23.9% in 2013 to 25.2% in 2014, and the dollar amount of these expenses increased by $6.4 million. In local currency, the increase would have been approximately $3.8 million, primarily resulting from increased expenses in our Specialty Markets service line, bad debt expense, and professional fees compared to the prior year.\nBROADSPIRE SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nBroadspire recorded operating earnings of $15.5 million in 2014, or 5.8% of revenues, compared with operating earnings of $8.2 million in 2013, or 3.3% of revenues. Operating earnings improved from 2013 to 2014 due to higher revenues and improved control over operating expenses. The results for 2013 included a one-time increase in revenues and operating earnings of approximately $3.0 million due to Broadspire being relieved of the obligation to continue to service certain clients' claims under lifetime pricing contracts and the associated release of the remaining deferred revenue for those claims.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nBroadspire revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation, Disability, and Liability Claims Management\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Management\n</td> <td>140,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Management Information Services\n</td> <td>15,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBroadspire segment revenues before reimbursements increased 6.6% to $268.9 million in 2014 compared with $252.2 million in 2013. Excluding the $3.0 million one-time benefit in 2013 discussed above, the revenue increase would have been 7.9%. Unit volumes for the Broadspire segment, measured principally by cases received, increased 7.9% from 2013 to 2014. Excluding approximately 5,000 one-time incident reports received from a major client in 2013 for which we received little or no revenue and incurred little or no associated costs, unit volume increased 9.5% for 2014 compared with 2013. After adjusting for the 5,000 incident reports and $3.0 million one-time benefit in 2013 discussed above, Broadspire had a negative price/mix variance of 1.6% in 2014 compared to 2013.\nThe overall increase in 2014 revenues compared with 2013 was primarily due to organic growth and increased client retention, revenues from new clients, the revenues associated with the transfer of workers' compensation cases from our U.S. Claims Services service line in the U.S. Services segment, and increased medical management services referrals.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Broadspire segment which are included in total Company revenues were $3.9 million in 2014, decreasing slightly from $4.0 million in 2013.\nCase Volume Analysis\nBroadspire unit volumes by major underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Workers' Compensation\n</td> <td>179,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty\n</td> <td>72,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>109,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Broadspire Cases Received\n</td> <td>360,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2014 increase in workers' compensation cases primarily resulted from new clients and from a transfer of approximately 2,000 workers' compensation cases from our U.S. Claims Services service line in the U.S. Services segment, as all workers' compensation cases in the U.S. are now handled by our Broadspire segment. The decrease in casualty cases in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to a decline of approximately 6,300 cases from two clients that were new in 2013, one of whose cases were expected to decline over time and the other a one-time takeover of cases. Casualty cases in 2013 were also positively impacted by the receipt in 2013 of approximately 5,000 incident reports from a major client for which we received little or no revenue and incurred little or no associated costs. The 2014 increase in other cases was primarily due to increased referrals to our medical management services from both new and existing clients.\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nBroadspire direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expense, as a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, decreased to 55.7% in 2014, compared with 56.7% in 2013. The decline was due to improved employee utilization. Average FTEs totaled 1,697 in 2014, up from 1,595 in 2013. The increase in employees was due to the increased case volumes.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nBroadspire segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor decreased as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements to 38.5% in 2014 from 40.1% in 2013. This decrease is because many of the fixed costs within the segment will not increase proportionately with an increase in revenues. Total 2014 expenses increased by $3.0 million compared with 2013, due to an increase in amortization for internally developed software and other expenses related to the growth in revenues.\nGARDEN CITY GROUP SEGMENT\nAs expected, Garden City Group revenues in 2014 declined compared with 2013 levels primarily because of lower revenues from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement special project and a few other large projects.\nOperating Earnings\nOur Garden City Group segment reported 2014 operating earnings of $22.8 million, decreasing 51.1% from $46.8 million in 2013, with the related operating margin decreasing from 21.4% in 2013 to 13.4% in 2014. The changes in the operating margin were primarily due to lower revenues from special projects discussed above impacting the absorption of fixed costs which did not decline as revenues declined.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nGarden City Group revenues before reimbursements decreased 22.2% to $170.3 million in 2014, compared with $218.8 million in 2013. The decrease in Garden City Group revenues was due primarily to the expected reductions in activity related to the special projects discussed above.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our Garden City Group segment which are included in total Company revenues were $29.7 million in 2014, decreasing from $32.7 million in 2013. This decrease was due to a lower volume of case administration work for settlements in the 2014 period. Reimbursable expenses may vary materially from year to year primarily due to the number of mailings each year and the mail method utilized (i.e., express mail versus normal mail delivery).\nDirect Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group direct compensation expense, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor, as a percent of segment revenues before reimbursements, increased to 69.1% in 2014, compared with 65.3% in 2013. The amount of related expenses declined to $117.6 million in 2014 compared with $143.0 million in 2013. The decreased amounts were primarily due to lower utilization of outsourced service providers because of the reduced activity associated with the Deepwater Horizon special project. There was an average of 805 FTEs in 2014, compared with an average of 690 in 2013. The increase in full-time equivalent employees resulted from the hiring of some previously temporary employees where it was cost effective to do so.\nExpenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\nGarden City Group expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor increased 2.5% to $29.8 million in 2014 from $29.1 million in 2013, and increased as a percent of related segment revenues before reimbursements to 17.5% in 2014 from 13.2% in 2013. The dollar amount of these expenses increased as a result of higher rent expense resulting from additional office space and higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with the purchase of new computer equipment and software. The increase as a percent of revenues before reimbursements was because expenses such as rent and depreciation, included in this category, are more fixed in nature and did not decline as revenues declined. During 2014, we reduced a contingent consideration liability from a previous acquisition by $2.0 million after concluding the consideration will not be paid. We also impaired and expensed the $1.3 million net book value of a customer list obtained in that acquisition in 2014.\nEXPENSES AND CREDITS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS\nIncome Taxes\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes may change periodically due to changes in enacted tax rates, fluctuations in the mix of income earned from our various domestic and international operations, which are subject to income taxes at different rates, our ability to utilize loss and tax credit carryforwards, and amounts related to uncertain income tax positions. Income tax provisions totaled $13.8 million, $28.8 million, and $29.8 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes was (43.5)%, 48.1%, and 36.7% for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The Company's 2015 effective income tax rate was distortive, primarily due to the largely nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, our inability to recognize tax benefits for certain international net operating losses, and fluctuations in the mix of income earned. Additionally, current year losses in certain operations, including losses due to restructuring and special charges, are in jurisdictions with lower tax rates or where the losses are unable to be benefited. Based on our 2016 operating plans, we anticipate our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes in 2016 to be in the 40% to 42% range before considering any discrete items.\nNet Corporate Interest Expense\nNet corporate interest expense consists of interest expense that we incur on our short- and long-term borrowings, partially offset by interest income we earn on available cash balances and short-term investments. These amounts vary based on interest rates, borrowings outstanding, the effect of any interest rate swaps, and the amounts of invested cash. Corporate interest expense totaled $9.0 million, $6.8 million, and $7.2 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2015 was due to the increased borrowings related to the GAB Robins acquisition. Corporate interest income was relatively consistent in each year, totaling $0.6 million, $0.8 million, and $0.8 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We pay interest on borrowings under our Credit Facility based on variable rates. Whether we can expect to see future reductions in interest expense compared with prior periods is dependent on the future direction of interest rates as well as the level of outstanding borrowings relative to prior periods.\nStock Option Expense\nStock option expense, a component of stock-based compensation, is comprised of non-cash expenses related to stock options granted under our various stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Stock option expense is not allocated to our operating segments. Stock option expense of $0.4 million, $0.9 million and $0.9 million was recognized during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Other stock-based compensation expense related to our Executive Stock Bonus Plan (pursuant to which we have authority to grant performance shares and restricted shares) is charged to our operating segments and included in the determination of segment operating earnings or loss.\nAmortization of Customer-Relationship Intangible Assets\nAmortization of customer-relationship intangible assets represents the non-cash amortization expense for finite-lived customer-relationship and trade name intangible assets. Amortization expense associated with these intangible assets totaled $9.7 million, $6.3 million, and $6.4 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase in 2015 was due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the GAB Robins acquisition. This amortization is included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nUnallocated Corporate and Shared Costs and Credits\nCertain unallocated costs and credits are excluded from the determination of segment operating earnings. These unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits represent costs of our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan, expenses for our chief executive officer and our Board of Directors, certain adjustments to our self-insured liabilities, certain unallocated professional fees, costs of our cross currency swap, and certain adjustments and recoveries to our allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. From time to time, we evaluate which corporate costs and credits are appropriately allocated to one or more of our operating segments. If changes are made to our allocation methodology, prior period allocations are revised to conform to our then-current allocation methodology.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits were $16.6 million, $8.6 million, and $10.8 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These costs increased in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to a $3.7 million increase in unallocated professional fees, $2.4 million in higher self-insured expenses, increased U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense of $1.5 million, and the settlement of a specific legal claim. The decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to decreases in unallocated professional fees, U.S. defined benefit plan expense, and incentive compensation, partially offset by increases in acquisition-related costs and self insured expenses\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nGoodwill impairment charges for 2015 were $49.3 million. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2014 or 2013. See Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\" and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about the 2015 goodwill impairment charges.\nRestructuring and Special Charges\nTotal restructuring and special charges for 2015 were $34.4 million. There were no restructuring or special charges in 2014 or 2013. See Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about the 2015 restructuring and special charges.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources, and Financial Condition\nWe fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under bank credit facilities.\nThe Company, its subsidiaries Crawford & Company Risk Services Investments Limited (the \"UK Borrower\"), Crawford & Company (Canada) Inc. (the \"Canadian Borrower\") and Crawford & Company (Australia) Pty. Ltd. (the \"Australian Borrower\") (the Company, together with such subsidiaries, as borrowers, the \"Borrowers\"), the Company's guarantor subsidiaries party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and a lender (\"Wells Fargo\"), and the other lenders party thereto (together with Wells Fargo, the \"Lenders\"), are party to a Credit Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2011 (as amended, the \"Credit Facility\"). On November 28, 2014, the Credit Facility was amended to provide the Company the ability to complete the December 1, 2014 acquisition of GAB Robins, and to make certain other technical amendments.\nThe Credit Facility consists of a $400.0 million revolving credit facility, with a letter of credit subfacility of $100.0 million. The Credit Facility contains sublimits of $185.0 million for borrowings by the UK Borrower, $40.0 million for borrowings by the Canadian Borrower, and $15.0 million for borrowings by the Australian Borrower. The Credit Facility matures, and all amounts outstanding thereunder, will be due and payable on November 25, 2018.\nOn November 5, 2015, Crawford, certain of its subsidiaries, Wells Fargo and the other signatories thereto entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the \"2015 Amendment\"). Pursuant to the 2015 Amendment, among other things, the definition of Consolidated EBITDA was revised to exclude certain restructuring charges, not to exceed $27.0 million in 2015 and $13.0 million in 2016, and $38.0 million in the aggregate. Additionally, the maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio with which the Company must comply were amended as described below. The 2015 Amendment also allows for the disposition of immaterial foreign subsidiaries with a book value not to exceed $15.0 million in the aggregate.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Euros, the currencies of Canada, Japan, Australia or United Kingdom and, subject to the terms of the Credit Facility, other currencies. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the option of the applicable Borrower, based on the Base Rate (as defined below) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), in each case plus an applicable interest margin based on the Company's leverage ratio (as defined below), provided that borrowings in foreign currencies may bear interest based on LIBOR only. The interest margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 1.50% to 2.25% and for Base Rate loans ranges from 0.50% to 1.25%. Base Rate is defined as the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent and (iii) LIBOR for a one month interest period plus 1.0%.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, a total of $243.7 million and $155.0 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Credit Facility. In addition, undrawn commitments under letters of credit totaling $17.2 million and $17.5 million were outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, under the letters of credit subfacility of the Credit Facility. These letter of credit commitments were for the Company's own obligations. Including the amounts committed under the letters of credit subfacility, the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility totaled $142.4 million and $149.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2014 available balance took into consideration the $78.4 million in debt incurred by the UK Borrower to complete the GAB Robins acquisition which was not on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2014.\nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by each existing domestic subsidiary of the Company and certain existing material foreign subsidiaries of the Company that are disregarded entities for U.S. income tax purposes (each a \"Disregarded Foreign Entity\"). Such obligations are required to be guaranteed by each subsequently acquired or formed material domestic subsidiary and Disregarded Foreign Entity (each, a \"Guarantor\"), and the obligations of the Foreign Borrowers are also guaranteed by the Company. In addition, the Borrowers' obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the personal property of the Company and the Guarantors, including, without limitation, intellectual property, 100% of the capital stock of the Company's and the Guarantors' present and future domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock and 100% of the non-voting stock issued by any present and future first-tier material foreign subsidiary of the Company or any Guarantor. In addition, the obligations of the Foreign Borrowers are secured by a first priority lien on 100% of the capital stock of the Foreign Borrowers.\nThe representations, covenants and events of default in the Credit Facility are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including required compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio (each as defined below).\nUnder the Credit Facility as amended, the fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of (i)(A) consolidated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other charges and expenses (\"EBITDA\") minus (B) aggregate income taxes to the extent paid in cash minus (C) unfinanced capital expenditures to (ii) the sum of: (A) consolidated interest expense to the extent paid (or required to be paid) in cash, plus (B) the aggregate of all scheduled payments of principal on funded debt (including the principal component of payments made in respect of capital lease obligations) required to have been made (whether or not such payments are actually made), plus (C) the aggregate of all restricted payments (as defined) paid, plus (D) the aggregate of all earnouts paid or required to be paid, must not be less than 1.25 to 1.00 for the four-quarter period ending at the end of each fiscal quarter.\nAlso under the Credit Facility as amended in 2015, the leverage ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated total funded debt minus unrestricted cash to (ii) consolidated EBITDA, must not be greater than 3.75 to 1.00 through September 30, 2016, with step-downs to 3.50 to 1.00 thereafter for fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2016 through September 30, 2017 and to 3.25 to 1.00 for fiscal quarters thereafter.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility. If the Company does not meet the covenant requirements in the future, it would be in default under the Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders may terminate the loan commitments, accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the Credit Facility and ancillary loan documents.\nWe are not aware of any additional restrictions placed on us, or being considered to be placed on us, related to our ability to access capital, such as borrowings under the Credit Facility. We do not rely on repurchase agreements or the commercial paper market to meet our short-term or long-term funding needs. For additional information on the key covenants contained in our Credit Facility, see \"Other Matters Concerning Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the covenants in our Credit Facility.\nWe continue the ongoing monitoring of our customers' ability to pay us for the services that we render to them. Based on historical results, we currently believe there is a low likelihood that write-offs of our existing accounts receivable will have a material impact on our financial results. However, if one or more of our key customers files bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to make required payments to us, or if overall economic conditions deteriorate, we may need to make material provisions in the future to increase our allowance for accounts receivable.\nThe operations of our International segment expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies. Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with the other functional currencies in certain of the locations in which we do business negatively impacted our revenues and operating earnings in 2015, 2014, and 2013. We cannot predict the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on our future revenues or operating earnings in our International segment.\nAt December 31, 2015, our working capital balance (current assets less current liabilities) was approximately $111.8 million, compared with $108.0 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in working capital was due to decreases in accounts payable and accrued compensation and related costs. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2015 totaled $76.1 million, compared with $52.5 million at the end of 2014.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 consisted of $12.9 million held in the U.S. and $63.2 million held in our foreign subsidiaries. All of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries is available for general corporate purposes. The Company generally does not provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company's current expectation is that such earnings will be reinvested by the subsidiaries or will be repatriated only when it would be tax effective or otherwise strategically beneficial to the Company such as if a very unusual event or project generated profits significantly in excess of ongoing business reinvestment needs. If such an event occurs, we would analyze our anticipated investment needs in that region and provide for U.S. taxes for earnings that are not expected to be permanently reinvested. Other historical earnings and future foreign earnings necessary for business reinvestment are expected to remain permanently reinvested and will be used to provide working capital for these operations, fund defined benefit pension plan obligations, repay non-U.S. debt, fund capital improvements, and fund future acquisitions. We currently believe that funds expected to be generated from our U.S. operations, along with potential borrowing capabilities in the U.S., will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operations and other obligations, including our funding obligations under our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, for the foreseeable future and, therefore, except in limited circumstances such as those described above, do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our U.S. operations. However, if at a future date or time these funds are necessary for our operations in the U.S. or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. No assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof, the tax consequences related thereto, or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $55.0 million in 2015, from $6.6 million in 2014 to $61.7 million in 2015. This increase was largely due to improved collections of accounts receivable and lower prepaid expenses in 2015 compared with 2014. Interest payments on our debt were $8.0 million in 2015, and tax payments, net of refunds, were $9.7 million in 2015.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $71.2 million in 2014, from $77.8 million in 2013 to $6.6 million in 2014. This decrease was largely due to higher cash payments for accounts payable, accrued liabilities, defined benefit pension plan contributions, and accrued compensation in 2014 compared with 2013, and an increase in accounts receivable. Interest payments on our debt were $5.9 million in 2014, and tax payments, net of refunds, were $13.0 million in 2014.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities increased by $69.4 million in 2015, from $31.8 million in 2014 to $101.2 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to the GAB Robins acquisition. Cash used to acquire property and equipment and capitalized software, including capitalization of costs for internally developed software, was $32.9 million in 2015 compared with $29.2 million in 2014. We forecast that our property and equipment additions in 2016, including capitalized software, will approximate $29 million.\nCash used in investing activities decreased by $1.8 million in 2014, from $33.5 million in 2013 to $31.8 million in 2014. Cash used to acquire property and equipment and capitalized software, including capitalization of costs for internally developed software, was $29.2 million in 2014 compared with $31.0 million in 2013.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $67.9 million in 2015. In 2015, we borrowed $147.5 million in short-term borrowings for working capital needs and to fund the GAB Robins acquisition, and we repaid a total of $62.0 million in short-term borrowings and $2.0 million in long-term debt and capital lease obligations. We used cash to pay quarterly cash dividends totaling $13.5 million and repurchased $1.2 million of our common stock. Also in 2015, we received shares of our Class A common stock that were surrendered by employees to settle $0.5 million of withholding taxes owed on the issuance of restricted and performance shares.\nCash used in financing activities was $4.5 million in 2014. We paid quarterly and special cash dividends totaling $11.7 million and repurchased $3.4 million of our common stock. We borrowed $121.1 million in short-term borrowings during the year for working capital needs, and we repaid a total of $98.8 million in short-term borrowings and $0.9 million in long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Also in 2014, we received shares of our Class A common stock that were surrendered by employees to settle $2.1 million of withholding taxes owed on the issuance of restricted and performance shares.\nOther Matters Concerning Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term debt obligations typically peak during the first quarter of each year due to the payment of incentive compensation awards, contributions to retirement plans, and certain other recurring payments, and generally decline during the balance of the year. Our maximum month-end short-term debt obligations were $20.0 million and $104.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our average month-end short-term debt obligations were $9.8 million and $59.9 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The outstanding balance of our short-term borrowings, excluding outstanding but undrawn letters of credit under our Credit Facility, was $20.0 million and $2.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The balance in short-term borrowings at December 31, 2015 represents amounts under our revolving Credit Facility that we expect, but are not required, to repay in the next twelve months. We have historically used the proceeds from our long-term borrowings to finance, among other things, business acquisitions.\nAs described above, we have two principal financial covenants in our Credit Facility. The leverage ratio covenant requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio, defined in our Credit Facility as the ratio of (i) consolidated total funded debt minus unrestricted cash to (ii) consolidated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other charges and expenses (\"EBITDA\"). This ratio must not be greater than 3.75 to 1.00 through September 30, 2016, with step-downs to 3.50 to 1.00 thereafter for fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2016 through September 30, 2017 and to 3.25 to 1.00 for fiscal quarters thereafter. The fixed charge coverage ratio covenant requires us to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of (i)(A) consolidated EBITDA minus (B) aggregate income taxes to the extent paid in cash minus (C) unfinanced capital expenditures to (ii) the sum of: (A) consolidated interest expense to the extent paid (or required to be paid) in cash, plus (B) the aggregate of all scheduled payments of principal on funded debt (including the principal component of payments made in respect of capital lease obligations) required to have been made (whether or not such payments are actually made), plus (C) the aggregate of all restricted payments (as defined) paid, plus (D) the aggregate of all earnouts paid or required to be paid, must not be less than 1.25 to 1.00 for the four-quarter period ending at the end of each fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all required ratios under our Credit Facility. Based on our financial plans, we expect to be able to remain in compliance with all required covenants throughout 2016. Our compliance with the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio is particularly sensitive to changes in our EBITDA, and if our financial plans for 2016 or other future periods do not meet our current projections, we could fail to remain in compliance with these financial covenants in our Credit Facility.\nOur compliance with the leverage ratio covenant is also sensitive to changes in our level of consolidated total funded debt, as defined in our Credit Facility. In addition to short- and long-term borrowings, capital leases, and bank overdrafts, among other things, consolidated total funded debt includes letters of credit, the need for which can fluctuate based on our business requirements. An increase in borrowings under our Credit Facility could negatively impact our leverage ratio, unless those increased borrowings are offset by a corresponding increase in our EBITDA. In addition, a reduction in EBITDA in the future could limit our ability to utilize available credit under the Credit Facility, which could negatively impact our ability to fund our current operations or make needed capital investments.\nWe believe our current financial resources, together with funds generated from operations and existing and potential borrowing capabilities, will be sufficient to maintain our current operations for the next 12 months.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, the impact that our contractual obligations, including estimated interest payments, are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:\n(Note references in the following table refer to the note in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (Note 6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current portions (Note 4) (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (Note 4) (1)\n</td> <td>2,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total, before interest payments\n</td> <td>44,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>415,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments under Credit Facility\n</td> <td>10,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Assumes principal amounts are repaid at maturity and not refinanced.\nApproximately $21.9 million of operating lease obligations included in the table above are expected to be funded by sublessors under existing sublease agreements. See Note 6, \"Commitments Under Operating Leases\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate, based on LIBOR or a Base Rate, in either case plus an applicable margin. Long-term debt refers to the required principal repayment at maturity of the Credit Facility, and may differ significantly from estimates, due to, among other things, actual amounts outstanding at maturity or any refinancings prior to such date. Interest amounts are based on projected borrowings under our Credit Facility and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2015, and the actual interest payments may differ significantly from estimates due to, among other things, changes in outstanding borrowings and prevailing interest rates in the future.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $6.2 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. We cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled. We expect $0.2 million in reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties.\nGross deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2015 were approximately $82.5 million. This amount is not included in the contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, we believe scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.\nDefined Benefit Pension Funding and Cost\nWe sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., (the \"U.S. Qualified Plan\") three defined benefit plans in the U.K. (the \"U.K. Plans\"), and defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, and the Philippines (the \"other international plans\"). Future cash funding of our defined benefit pension plans will depend largely on future investment performance, interest rates, changes to mortality tables, and regulatory requirements. Effective December 31, 2002, we froze our U.S. Qualified Plan. The aggregate deficit in the funded status of the U.S. Plan, U.K. Plans and other international plans totaled $121.7 million and $142.3 million at the end of 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 decrease in the unfunded deficit of our defined benefit pension plans primarily resulted from an increase in discount rates, the adoption of updated mortality tables used to determine U.S. Qualified Plan liabilities, and incremental benefit payments. During 2015, we made contributions of $9.0 million and $6.6 million to our U.S. Qualified Plan and U.K. Plans, respectively. In 2014, we made contributions of $14.9 million and $7.0 million to our U.S. Qualified Plan and U.K. Plans, respectively.\nOur frozen U.S. Qualified Plan was underfunded by $120.5 million at December 31, 2015 based on an accumulated benefit obligation of $501.2 million. Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (\"BBA2015\") included pension funding reform which greatly reduced the contributions required to the U.S. Plan, Crawford plans to contribute $9.0 million per annum to the U.S. Plan for the next three fiscal years to improve the funded status of the plan and minimize future required contributions. Required contributions are still anticipated in future years as the impact of the BBA2015 funding reform is phased out. We estimate that we will make the following annual minimum contributions over the next five years to our frozen U.S. Qualified Plan:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>Estimated U.S. Pension Funding\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>18,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>19,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunding requirements are no longer as sensitive to changes in the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the plan as they were prior to 2008. In addition to BBA2015 legislation discussed above, pension funding has been governed by rules under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended by the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, and the Highway Transportation Funding Act of 2014. Volatility in the capital markets and future legislation may have a negative impact on our U.S. and U.K. pension plans, which may further increase the underfunded portion of our pension plans and our attendant funding obligations. Expected and required contributions to our underfunded defined benefit pension plans will reduce our liquidity, restrict available cash for our operating, financing, and investing needs and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to deploy capital to other opportunities.\nCommercial Commitments\nAs a component of our Credit Facility, we maintain a letter of credit facility to satisfy certain contractual obligations. At December 31, 2015, the issued, but undrawn, letters of credit totaled approximately $17.2 million. These letters of credit are typically renewed annually, but unless renewed, will expire as follows:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, we were not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases, which could materially impact our operations, financial condition, or cash flows. We have certain material obligations under operating lease agreements to which we are a party. In accordance with GAAP, these operating lease obligations and the related leased assets are not reported on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe maintain funds in trusts to administer claims for certain clients. These funds are not available for our general operating activities and, as such, have not been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We have concluded that we do not have material off-balance sheet financial risk related to these funds at December 31, 2015.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nThe following addresses changes in our financial condition not addressed elsewhere in this MD&A.\nSignificant changes on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, compared with our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, were as follows:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accounts receivable decreased by $15.5 million, or $26.5 million, excluding the effect of the GAB Robins acquisition and foreign currency exchange impacts, in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the decrease in Garden City Group accounts receivable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets increased by $14.2 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to an increase of $11.7 million in the net prepaid pension balances of two U.K. defined benefit plans that are in an overfunded position, and a $2.9 million increase in the value of our Canadian cross currency basis swap.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accrued compensation and related costs decreased by $13.3 million in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to reduced incentive compensation payments accrued at year end due to lower than anticipated operating results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Noncurrent deferred income tax assets decreased by $19.6 million primarily due to the tax impact of the adjustments to retirement liabilities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and the adoption of ASU 2015-17, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Current deferred income tax liabilities decreased $14.5 million due to the adoption of ASU 2015-17.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis MD&A addresses our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under then-existing circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Changes in these underlying estimates could potentially materially affect consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the period of change. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, the amounts provided for are based on the best information available to us and we believe these estimates are reasonable.\nWe have discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this MD&A.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily comprised of claims processing or program administration fees. Fees for professional services are recognized as unbilled revenues at estimated collectible amounts at the time such services are rendered. Substantially all unbilled revenues are billed within one year. Out-of-pocket costs incurred in administering a claim are typically passed on to our clients and included in our revenues under GAAP. Deferred revenues represent the estimated unearned portion of fees related to future services to be performed under certain fixed-fee service arrangements. Deferred revenues are recognized into revenues based on the estimated rate at which the services are provided. These rates are primarily based on an evaluation of historical claim closing rates by major lines of coverage. Additionally, recent claim closing rates are evaluated to ensure that current claim closing history does not indicate a significant deterioration or improvement in the longer-term historical closing rates used.\nOur fixed-fee service arrangements typically require us to handle claims on either a one- or two-year basis, or for the lifetime of the claim. In cases where we handle a claim on a non-lifetime basis, we typically receive an additional fee on each anniversary date that the claim remains open. For service arrangements where we provide services for the life of the claim, we are only paid one fee for the life of the claim, regardless of the duration of the claim. As a result, our deferred revenues for claims handled for one or two years are not as sensitive to changes in claim closing rates since the revenues are recognized in the near future, and additional fees are generated for handling long-lived claims. Deferred revenues for lifetime claim handling are considered more sensitive to changes in claim closing rates since we are obligated to handle these claims to their conclusion with no additional fees received for long-lived claims. For all fixed fee service arrangements, revenues are recognized over the expected service periods, by type of claim.\nBased upon our historical averages, we close approximately 98% of all cases referred to us under lifetime claim service arrangements within five years from the date of referral. Also, within that five-year period, the percentage of cases remaining open in any one particular year has remained relatively consistent from period to period. Each quarter we evaluate our historical case closing rates by type of claim and make adjustments as necessary. Any changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined.\nAs of December 31, 2015, deferred revenues related to lifetime claim handling arrangements approximated $45.1 million. If the rate at which we close cases changes, the amount of revenues recognized within a period could be affected. In addition, given the competitive environment in which we operate, we may be unable to raise our prices to offset the additional expense associated with handling longer-lived claims should such case closing rates change. The change in our first-year case closing rates over the last ten years has ranged from a decrease of 3.5% to an increase of 4.8%, and has averaged a decrease of 0.4%. A 1.0% change is a reasonably likely change in our estimate based on historical data. Absent an increase in per-claim fees from our clients, a 1.0% decrease in claim closing rates for lifetime claims could result in the deferral of additional revenues of approximately $1.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. If our average claim closing rates for lifetime claims increased by 1.0%, we could recognize additional revenues of approximately $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments and for adjustments to invoiced amounts. Losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments are accounted for as bad debt expense, while adjustments to invoices are accounted for as reductions to revenues. These allowances are established by using historical write-off information intended to determine future loss expectations and by considering the current credit worthiness of our clients, any known specific collection problems, and our assessment of current industry conditions. Actual experience may differ significantly from historical or expected loss results. Each quarter, we evaluate the adequacy of the assumptions used in determining these allowances and make adjustments as necessary. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Historically, our estimates have been materially accurate.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $13.1 million and $11.0 million, or approximately 7.4% and 5.7% of gross billed receivables at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. If the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an inability to make required payments to us, or if economic conditions deteriorate, additional allowances may be deemed to be appropriate or required. If the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by 1.0% of gross billed receivables, reflecting either an increase or decrease in expected future write-offs, the impact to consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $1.8 million in 2015, $1.9 million in 2014, and $1.7 million in 2013.\nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other long-lived assets have been impaired. Goodwill is an asset that represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets (tangible and intangible) acquired in certain business combinations. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names associated with acquired businesses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing at least annually. When factors indicate that such assets should be evaluated for possible impairment between the scheduled annual impairment tests, we perform an interim impairment test. Our other long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment, deferred income tax assets, capitalized software, and amortizable intangible assets related to customer relationships, technology, and trade names with finite lives. Other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are identified.\nIn the annual impairment analysis of goodwill, we compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the estimated fair values of those reporting units as determined by a combination of the income approach, specifically discounting future projected cash flows, and the market approach, specifically the Guideline Public Company Method, as described in more detail in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We perform an interim impairment analysis of goodwill when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The estimated fair values of our reporting units are based upon certain assumptions made by us. The estimated fair values of our reporting units are reconciled to the Company's total market value as determined by its stock price in order to validate the reasonableness of the estimated market values of each of the reporting units.\nGoodwill impairment testing is a two-step process performed on a reporting unit basis. As determined in the step 1 analysis, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not deemed impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill following a hypothetical acquisition accounting process. This hypothetical acquisition accounting process is applied only for the purpose of determining whether goodwill must be reduced; it is not used to adjust the carrying values of other assets or liabilities. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill, and it cannot subsequently be reversed.\nWe currently have five reporting units for goodwill impairment purposes. These reporting units are our U.S. Services segment excluding U.S. Contractor Connection operations, our U.S. Contractor Connection operations on a stand-alone basis, and our other reporting segments - International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned two of our reportable segments by moving our Canada and Latin America/Caribbean operations from the former Americas segment to the newly formed International segment, previously referred to as the EMEA/AP segment. The former Americas segment, without Canada and Latin America/Caribbean, is now the U.S. Services segment. We performed goodwill impairment testing on our reporting units both before and after this realignment of reporting segments.\nFor goodwill impairment testing purposes, in 2014 and 2015 prior to the realignment of reporting segments, we analyzed the following reporting units: U.S. Contractor Connection, Americas excluding U.S. Contractor Connection, Broadspire, Garden City Group, and the former EMEA/AP segment.\nDuring the step 1 analysis in 2015, we determined the carrying value of our EMEA/AP and Americas excluding U.S. Contractor Connection reporting units exceeded their fair values due to a variety of factors including achieving less than forecasted operating earnings, a reduced market capitalization, an increase in discount rates, and changes in foreign exchange rates.\nAs a result, step 2 of the goodwill impairment analysis was required for the EMEA/AP and Americas excluding U.S. Contractor Connection reporting units, and goodwill impairments of $38.1 million and $11.2 million, respectively, were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. The estimated fair values as calculated in our step 1 goodwill impairment analysis for all of our other reporting units exceeded the carrying values of the reporting units.\nThe key assumptions used in estimating the fair values of its reporting units utilizing the income approach include the discount rate, the terminal growth rate, and the net working capital turnover. The discount rates utilized in estimating the fair value of our reporting units in 2015 were between the range of 12.5% and 18.5%, reflecting our assessment of a market participant's view of the risks associated with the projected cash flows. The terminal growth rate used in the analysis was 2.0%. The net working capital turnover assumption ranged from 5 to 20. The assumptions used in estimating the fair values are based on currently available data and management's best estimates of revenues and cash flows and, accordingly, a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the estimated values. There are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management's application of these assumptions.\nAdditional assumptions are used in the step 2 analysis in estimating the fair value of assets and liabilities of the applicable reporting units. These assumptions primarily relate to the estimated fair value of certain intangible assets and generally include operating earnings, the royalty rate, discount rate, long term sales growth rate, and the annual customer attrition rate. The royalty rates utilized were within the range of 1.5% and 3.0%, and the weighted average cost of capital rates used to determine the discount rates for the individual intangible assets were between the range of 18.0% and 18.5%, reflecting our assessment of a market participant's view of the risks associated with the projected cash flows. The long term sales growth rate used in the analysis was 2.0%. The annual customer attrition rate assumption was 5%.\nWe also performed goodwill impairment testing on our reporting units after the realignment of reporting segments. No further impairment was indicated, as the fair value of these reporting units exceeded the carrying value in the post-realignment step 1 analysis.\nSubsequent to the analyses and goodwill impairment charges discussed above, the International segment has $49.7 million of remaining goodwill associated with it that is at risk of potential future impairment. The estimated fair values as calculated in our goodwill impairment step 1 analysis exceeded the carrying values for all of our other reporting units by a significant margin. Holding all other assumptions constant, the International segment would have to achieve more than approximately 85% of its forecasted operating earnings to avoid completion of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test in the future. We intend to continue to monitor the performance of the International reporting unit. Should actual operating earnings consistently fall below forecasted operating earnings, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis.\nThe indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of the Broadspire and SLS trade names, with carrying values of $29.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, are also evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when indicators of potential impairment are identified. Based on our 2015 analysis, we do not believe these trade names are exposed to potential impairments. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test involves estimating the fair value using an internally prepared discounted cash flow analysis. The fair values of the trade names are established using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. This method recognizes that, by virtue of owning the trade name as opposed to licensing it, a company or reporting unit is relieved from paying a royalty, usually expressed as a percentage of net sales, for the asset's use. The present value of the after-tax costs savings (i.e., royalty relief) at an appropriate discount rate including a tax amortization benefit indicates the value of the trade name. We determined the discount rate based on our performance compared to similar market participants, factored by risk in forecasting using a modified capital asset pricing model.\nThe values of the Broadspire and SLS trade names are each sensitive to changes in the assumptions used above. A decline in the U.S. royalty rate to 1.0%, or an increase in the discount rate by 2.5%, assuming no changes in the other key inputs, could potentially trigger an impairment of the Broadspire trade name. A decline in the royalty rate by 1% in combination with an increase in the discount rate by 2.5% could potentially trigger an impairment of the SLS trade name. We will continue to monitor the value of these trade names for potential indicators of impairment.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor various defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and U.K. that cover a substantial number of current and former employees in each location. We utilize the services of independent actuaries to help us estimate our pension obligations and measure pension costs. Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan was frozen on December 31, 2002. Our U.K. defined benefit pension plans were closed to new employees as of October 31, 1997, but existing participants may still accrue additional limited benefits based on salary levels existing at the close date. Benefits payable under our U.S. defined benefit pension plan are generally based on career compensation; however, no additional benefits accrue on our frozen U.S. plan after December 31, 2002. Benefits payable under the U.K. plans are generally based on an employee's salary at the time the applicable plan was closed. Our funding policy is to make cash contributions in amounts sufficient to maintain the plans on an actuarially sound basis, but not in excess of amounts deductible under applicable income tax regulations. Note 8, \"Retirement Plans,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides details about the assumptions used in determining the funded status of the plans, the unrecognized actuarial gain/(loss), the components of net periodic benefit cost, benefit payments expected to be made in the future and plan asset allocations.\nInvestment objectives for the Company's U.S. and U.K. pension plan assets are to:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ensure availability of funds for payment of plan benefits as they become due;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital, without undue exposure to volatility, and protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>provide investment results that meet or exceed the plans' actuarially assumed long-term rate of return.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe long-term goal for the U.S. and U.K. plans is to reach fully-funded status and to maintain that status. The investment policies contemplate the plans' asset return requirements and risk tolerances changing over time. Accordingly, reallocation of the portfolios' mix of return-seeking assets and liability-hedging assets will be performed as the plans' funded status improves. In conjunction with our investment policies we have rebalanced the U.S. and U.K. plans' target allocation mix to reallocate from an equity-weighted to a fixed-income weighted investment strategy, as the plans' funded status has improved and as we have made cash contributions to the plan.\nThe rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our results, financial condition and liquidity. Our pension expense is primarily a function of the value of our plan assets and the discount rate used to measure our pension liability at a single point in time at the end of our fiscal year (the measurement date). Both of these factors are significantly influenced by the stock and bond markets, which in recent years have experienced substantial volatility.\nIn addition to expense volatility, we are required to record mark-to-market adjustments to our balance sheet on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension plans. These adjustments have fluctuated significantly over the past several years and, like our pension expense, are a result of the discount rate and value of our plan assets at each measurement date, as well as periodic changes to mortality tables used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants. The funded status of our plans may also impact our liquidity, as changes to funding laws in the U.S. may require higher funding levels for our pension plans.\nThe major assumptions used in accounting for our defined benefit pension plans are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, and the mortality expectations for plan participants. The discount rate assumptions reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. Our discount rates were determined with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that generally match our expected benefit payments in future years. At December 31, 2015, the discount rate used to compute the benefit obligations of the U.S. and U.K. plans were 4.40% and 3.85%, respectively.\nThe estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is required to be the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are invested primarily in collective funds. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we have transitioned to a liability-driven investment strategy with a greater concentration of fixed-income securities to better align plan assets with liabilities.\nEstablishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over time; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. To support our conclusions, we periodically commission asset/liability studies performed by third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries to assist us in our reviews. These studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets. As a result of the transition to a liability-driven investment strategy described previously, the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption used to determine 2016 net periodic pension cost were estimated to be 6.50% and 5.60% for the U.S. and U.K. plans, respectively.\nWe review our employee demographic assumptions annually and update the assumptions as necessary. During 2015, we revised the mortality assumptions for the U.S. plans to incorporate the new set of mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries, adjusted to reflect Company-specific experience and future expectations. This resulted in a $10.5 million decrease in the projected benefit obligation for the U.S. plans.\nPension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We apply our expected return on plan assets using fair market value as of the annual measurement date. The fair market value method results in greater volatility to our pension expense than the calculated value method. The amounts recognized in the balance sheet reflect a snapshot of the state of our long-term pension liabilities at the plan measurement date and the effect of mark-to-market accounting on plan assets. At December 31, 2015, we recorded an increase to equity through other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") of $8.2 million (net of tax) to reflect unrealized actuarial gains during 2015. At December 31, 2014, we recorded a decrease to equity through OCI of $43.2 million (net of tax) to reflect unrealized actuarial losses during 2014. Those changes are subject to amortization over future years and may be reflected in future income statements.\nCumulative unrecognized actuarial losses for all plans were $309.9 million through December 31, 2015, compared with $334.7 million through December 31, 2014. These unrecognized losses reflect changes in the discount rates, differences between expected and actual asset returns, and changes to mortality expectations for plan participants, which are being amortized over future periods. These unrecognized losses may be recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. However, unless the minimum amount required to be amortized is below a corridor amount equal to 10.0% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, these unrecognized actuarial losses are required to be amortized and recognized in future periods. For example, projected pension plan expense for 2016 includes $13.0 million of amortization of these actuarial losses versus $13.4 million in 2015, $11.8 million in 2014 and $13.3 million in 2013.\nNet periodic pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans is sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions for the expected rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the plans. If our assumptions for the expected returns on plan assets of our U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans changed by 0.5%, representing either an increase or decrease in expected returns, the impact to 2015 consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $3.3 million. If our assumptions for the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected benefits payable under the plans changed by 0.25%, representing either an increase or decrease in interest rates used to value pension plan liabilities, the impact to 2015 consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $0.7 million.\nDetermination of Effective Tax Rate Used for Financial Reporting\nWe account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Provisions for deferred taxes are made in recognition of these temporary differences. The most significant differences relate to revenue recognition, accrued compensation and pensions, self-insurance, and depreciation and amortization.\nFor financial reporting purposes in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes, the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. Currently payable income taxes represent the liability related to our income tax returns for the current year, while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our consolidated balance sheets that are not related to balances in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\" The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon changes between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for income tax purposes, multiplied by the enacted statutory tax rates for the year in which we estimate these differences will reverse. We must estimate the timing of the reversal of temporary differences, as well as whether taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets.\nOther factors which influence our effective tax rate used for financial reporting purposes include changes in enacted statutory tax rates, changes in the composition of taxable income from the countries in which we operate, our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\nOur effective tax rate, defined as our provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes, for financial reporting purposes in 2015, 2014, and 2013 was (43.5)%, 48.1%, and 36.7%, respectively. If our effective tax rate used for financial reporting purposes changed by 1.0%, we would have recognized an increase or decrease to income taxes of approximately $316,000, $591,000, and $811,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes is expected to range between 40% and 42% in 2016 before considering any discrete items.\nIt is possible that future changes in the tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate could have a significant impact on U.S.-based multinational companies such as our Company. At this time we cannot predict the likelihood or details of any such changes or their specific potential impact on our Company.\nOur most significant deferred tax assets are related to the unfunded liability of our defined benefit pension plans, tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards. The tax deduction for defined benefit pension plans generally occurs upon funding of plan liabilities. Assuming that the estimated minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and the income projections are met, the deferred tax asset should be realized.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we have considered the four possible sources of taxable income that may be available to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards and have a $17.2 million valuation allowance on certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in our international and domestic operations. For our remaining deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize these assets based on our forecast of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that are available to the Company. Future changes in the valuation allowance, if required, should not affect our liquidity or our compliance with any existing debt covenants.\nOur tax credit carryforwards for which we have not recorded a valuation allowance primarily consist of $31.7 million of foreign tax credit (\"FTC\") carryforwards, which materially expire in 2020. Companies that cannot credit all the foreign taxes paid or deemed paid in a particular tax year because their foreign taxes exceed their FTC limitation are allowed to carry their excess taxes back to the preceding tax year and then forward to the ten succeeding years. Utilization of our FTCs is dependent upon sufficient U.S. regular taxable income and foreign source income which is impacted by the interaction of overall domestic and overall foreign loss rules. Based on our projections of income through 2019, we expect to fully utilize the FTC carryforwards before expiration without implementing available tax planning strategies. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the FTC carryforwards will be utilized.\nThe NOL carryforwards for which a valuation allowance is not recorded primarily consists of $11.7 million of U.K. NOL carryforwards and $8.5 million of state NOL carryforwards generated by our domestic companies.\nIn the U.K., NOL carryforwards have an unlimited life; therefore, we did not consider available tax planning strategies. Based on our projections of income, we expect to fully utilize the U.K. NOL carryforwards. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we should be able to utilize our U.K. NOL carryforwards.\nIn order to fully utilize these state NOL carryforwards, our domestic companies must generate taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards. Based on our projections of income, the Company expects to fully utilize its state NOL carryforwards before expiration without implementing available tax planning strategies. Accordingly, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the Company should be able to utilize its state NOL carryforwards.\nThe remaining NOL carryforwards were generated by certain foreign jurisdictions and are generally offset by full valuation allowances.\nSelf-Insured Risks\nWe self-insure certain insurable risks consisting primarily of professional liability, auto liability, employee medical, disability, and workers' compensation. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures, including professional liability on a claims-made basis, and those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Most of these self-insured risks are in the U.S. Provisions for claims incurred under self-insured programs are made based on our estimates of the aggregate liabilities for claims incurred, including estimated legal fees, losses that have occurred but have not been reported to us, and the adverse developments on reported losses. These estimated liabilities are calculated based on historical claim payment experience, the expected life of the claims, and other factors considered relevant to the claims. The liabilities for claims incurred under our self-insured workers' compensation and employee disability programs are discounted at the prevailing risk-free rate for government issues of an appropriate duration. All other self-insured liabilities are undiscounted. Each quarter we evaluate the adequacy of the assumptions used in developing these estimated liabilities and make adjustments as necessary. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Historically, our estimates have been materially accurate.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our estimated liabilities for self-insured risks totaled $23.5 million and $24.5 million, respectively. The estimated liability is most sensitive to changes in the ultimate liability for a claim and, if applicable, the interest rate used to discount the liability. We believe our provisions for self-insured losses are adequate to cover the expected net cost of losses incurred. However, these provisions are estimates and amounts ultimately settled may be significantly greater or less than the provisions established. We used a discount rate of 1.67% to determine the present value of our self-insured workers' compensation liabilities as of December 31, 2015. If the average discount rate was reduced by 1.0% or increased by 1.0%, reflecting either an increase or decrease in underlying interest rates, our estimated liabilities for these self-insured risks at December 31, 2015 would have been impacted by approximately $412,000, resulting in an increase or decrease to 2015 consolidated net income of approximately $253,000.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates, or expected dates of adoption, and effects, or expected effects, on our disclosures, results of operations, and financial condition.",

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand Crawford & Company, our operations, and our business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As described in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of those accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, financial results from our operations outside of the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, and certain subsidiaries in the Philippines, are reported and consolidated on a two-month delayed basis in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, \"Consolidation,\" in order to provide sufficient time for accumulation of their results. Accordingly, the Company's December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 consolidated financial statements include the financial position of such operations as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal periods ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nBusiness Overview\nBased in Atlanta, Georgia, Crawford & Company (www.crawfordandcompany.com) is one of the world's largest independent providers of claims management solutions to the risk management and insurance industry, as well as to self-insured entities, with an expansive global network serving clients in more than 70 countries. The Crawford SolutionSM offers comprehensive, integrated claims services, business process outsourcing and consulting services for major product lines including property and casualty claims management, workers' compensation claims and medical management, and legal settlement administration.\nShares of the Company's two classes of common stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbols CRDA and CRDB, respectively. The Company's two classes of stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting rights and the Company's ability to pay greater cash dividends on the non-voting Class A Common Stock than on the voting Class B Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. In addition, with respect to mergers or similar transactions, holders of Class A Common Stock must receive the same type and amount of consideration as holders of Class B Common Stock, unless different consideration is approved by the holders of 75% of the Class A Common Stock, voting as a class.\nAs discussed in more detail in subsequent sections of this MD&A, we have four operating segments: U.S. Services, International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group. Our four operating segments represent components of our Company for which separate financial information is available, and which is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company realigned two of its reportable segments by moving its Canada and Latin America/Caribbean operations from the former Americas segment to the newly formed International segment, previously referred to as the EMEA/AP (Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific) segment. The former Americas segment, without Canada and Latin America/Caribbean, is now the U.S. Services segment. The results of the former EMEA/AP and Americas segments are no longer reported separately. U.S. Services primarily serves the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. International serves the property and casualty insurance company and self-insurance markets outside the U.S. Broadspire serves the U.S. self-insurance marketplace. Garden City Group serves the class action, regulatory, mass tort, bankruptcy, and other legal administration markets, primarily in the U.S. The results of prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation of our reportable segments. The change in reporting segments did not have any impact on previously reported consolidated financial results.\nInsurance companies, which represent the major source of our global revenues, customarily manage their own claims administration function but often rely on third parties for certain services which we provide, primarily field investigation and the evaluation of property and casualty insurance claims. We are also experiencing increased utilization by insurance companies of the managed repair network provided by our Contractor Connection division.\nSelf-insured entities typically rely on us for a broader range of services. In addition to field investigation and claims evaluation, we may also provide initial loss reporting services for their claimants, loss mitigation services such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation, risk management information services, and trust fund administration to pay their claims.\nWe also perform legal settlement administration services related to securities, product liability, and other class action settlements and bankruptcies, including identifying and qualifying class members, determining and dispensing settlement payments, and administering settlement funds.\nThe global claims management services market is highly competitive and comprised of a large number of companies of varying size and that offer a varied scope of services. The demand from insurance companies and self-insured entities for services provided by independent claims service firms like us is largely dependent on industry-wide claims volumes, which are affected by, among other things, the insurance underwriting cycle, weather-related events, general economic activity, overall employment levels, and workplace injury rates. Demand is also impacted by decisions insurance companies and self-insured entities may make with respect to the level of claims outsourced to independent claim service firms as opposed to those handled by their own in-house claims adjusters. In addition, our ability to retain clients and maintain or increase case referrals is also dependent in part on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, competitively priced services and effective sales efforts.\nWe typically earn our revenues on an individual fee-per-claim basis for claims management services we provide to insurance companies and self-insured entities. Accordingly, the volume of claim referrals to us is a key driver of our revenues. Generally, fees are earned on cases as services are provided, which generally occurs in the period the case is assigned to us, although sometimes a portion or substantially all of the revenues generated by a specific case assignment will be earned in subsequent periods. We cannot predict the future trend of case volumes for a number of reasons, including the frequency and severity of weather-related cases and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of cases for us and are not subject to accurate forecasting.\nThe legal settlement administration market within which our Garden City Group segment operates is also highly competitive but is comprised of a smaller number of specialized entities. The demand for legal settlement administration services is generally not directly tied to or affected by the insurance underwriting cycle. The demand for these services is largely dependent on the volume of securities and product liability class action settlements, the volume of bankruptcy filings and the resulting settlements, volume of mass torts and general economic conditions. Our revenues for legal settlement administration services are largely project-based and we earn these revenues as we perform individual tasks and deliver the outputs as outlined in each project.\nOn December 1, 2014, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of GAB Robins, a loss adjusting and claims management provider headquartered in the U.K. which reports through our International segment. We believe the GAB Robins acquisition enables Crawford to significantly expand its claims handling business across a wide range of product lines in the U.K. and bolster its global specialty lines claims business. The success of the GAB Robins acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies and cost savings from integrating GAB Robins on a timely basis. The integration process continues to be complex, costly, and time-consuming, and no assurances of the success of the process can be provided. Because the financial results of certain of our international subsidiaries, including those in the U.K. through which GAB Robins reports, are included in our consolidated financial statements on a two-month delayed basis as described above, the results of GAB Robins' business are included in our consolidated results of operations beginning February 1, 2015. In addition, the $78.4 million in Credit Facility borrowings used to complete the GAB Robins acquisition were not included in outstanding borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014, because the U.K.-based borrowing entity has an October 31 fiscal year end, and the balance sheet of that entity was consolidated as of October 31, 2014.\nIn 2014, we established a wholly-owned global business services center in Manila, Philippines. We have subsequently expanded the capabilities of the center to include Information Technology services performed in Pune, India (the \"Centers\"). The Centers provide us venues for global consolidation of certain business functions, shared services, and currently outsourced processes. The Centers, which are expected to be phased in through 2018, are expected to allow us to continue to strengthen our client service, realize additional operational efficiencies, and invest in new capabilities for growth. Operations in the Centers are expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of approximately $60 million through 2019 and annual cost savings of approximately $20 million per year thereafter. To achieve these savings, we expect to record charges totaling approximately $20 million through 2018. An initial charge of $4.4 million was incurred in 2015, which was partially offset by initial savings in 2015 of approximately $2 million. We expect to record charges of $8.4 million in 2016, which should be partially offset by combined savings in 2016 of $8 million. No assurances can be provided of our ability to timely or cost effectively complete and ramp up operations at the Centers, or to achieve expected cost savings on a timely basis, or at all.\nIn 2015 we also announced various restructuring plans intended to, among other things, reduce overhead costs in certain functions and in our business segments, and streamline senior management to reduce costs and further improve execution. These plans included integration costs related to the GAB Robins acquisition and other special charges discussed in Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring and special charges associated with these plans totaled $30.0 million in 2015, and another $7.2 million of costs are expected in 2016.\nGoodwill impairment charges for 2015 were $49.3 million. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2014 or 2013. See Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\" and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about the 2015 goodwill impairment charges.\nResults of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated revenues before reimbursements were $1.170 billion in 2015, an increase of 2.4% compared with $1.143 billion in 2014. Net loss attributable to Crawford & Company was $(45.5) million in 2015, compared with net income of $30.6 million in 2014 and $51.0 million in 2013. During 2015, the Company recorded restructuring and special charges of $34.4 million. The Company also recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million in 2015. There were no similar charges in 2014 or 2013.\nSegment operating earnings (a measure of segment operating performance used by our management that is defined and discussed in more detail below) improved in our U.S. Services and Broadspire segments from 2013 to 2014 and from 2014 to 2015, while we experienced operating earnings declines in our International and Garden City Group segments in those periods.\nCompared with 2014, our consolidated revenues before reimbursements were 2.4% higher in 2015 due primarily to revenue growth in U.S. Services and Broadspire, and the GAB Robins acquisition in International, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, and lower revenues at Garden City Group.\nIn the U.S. Services segment, operating earnings improved from 2014 to 2015 due to continued growth in our U.S. Contractor Connection managed repair network, growth in U.S. Catastrophe Services primarily due to an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, and cost reduction initiatives in 2015. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in weather related cases in the U.S. Claims Field Operations in 2015.\nOperating earnings in our International segment declined in 2015 compared to 2014, due to a reduction in weather-related claim activity and decline in high-frequency, low-complexity claims in the U.K. and Asia-Pacific in 2015, and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nBroadspire's operating earnings improved each year from 2013 to 2015. The improvements were due to higher revenues from both new and existing clients, and improved control over operating expenses.\nAs expected, Garden City Group's operating earnings declined in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting a decline in revenues from certain special projects. The Garden City Group had lower revenues in 2015 from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project and another non-Gulf related special project, compared with 2014. Operating earnings were higher in this segment in both 2014 and 2013, compared with 2015, due to these special projects.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were 1.6% higher in 2015 than in 2014 and 2.4% higher in 2014 than in 2013. The increase in 2015 was attributable to increases in SG&A expenses from the GAB Robins acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. The increase in 2014 was due to an increase in acquisition-related costs, professional fees and self-insurance expense, partially offset by a decrease in short-term and long-term incentive compensation costs.\nSegment Operating Earnings of our Operating Segments\nWe believe that a discussion and analysis of the segment operating earnings of our four operating segments is helpful in understanding the results of our operations. Operating earnings is our segment measure of profitability as discussed in Note 13, \"Segment and Geographic Information,\" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by our senior management and CODM to evaluate the financial performance of our operating segments and make resource allocation decisions.\nWe believe operating earnings is a measure that is useful to others in that it allows them to evaluate segment operating performance using the same criteria used by our senior management and CODM. Segment operating earnings represent segment earnings, including the direct and indirect costs of certain administrative functions required to operate our business but excludes unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, goodwill impairment, restructuring and special charges, income taxes, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nFor most of our international operations and for Garden City Group, many administrative functions, such as finance, human resources, information technology, quality and compliance, are embedded in those locations and are considered direct costs of those operations. For our domestic operations (primarily Broadspire and the U.S. Services segments), we have a centralized shared-services arrangement for most of these administrative functions, and we allocate the costs of those services to the segments as indirect costs based on usage. Although some of the administrative services in our shared-services center benefit, and are allocated to, more than one of our operating segments, the majority of these shared services are allocated to the Broadspire and U.S. Services segments.\nIncome taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, and amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets are recurring components of our net income, but they are not considered part of our segment operating earnings because they are managed on a corporate-wide basis. Income taxes are calculated for the Company on a consolidated basis based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which we provide services, and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Net corporate interest expense results from capital structure decisions made by senior management and the Board of Directors and affecting the Company as a whole. Stock option expense represents the non-cash costs generally related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan expenses which are not allocated to our operating segments. Amortization expense is a non-cash expense for customer-relationship intangible assets acquired in business combinations. None of these costs relate directly to the performance of our services or operating activities and, therefore, are excluded from segment operating earnings in order to better assess the results of each segment's operating activities on a consistent basis.\nAlthough associated with particular operating segments, goodwill impairment charges are not allocated to any particular segment since they do not impact our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance.\nRestructuring and special charges arise from time to time from events (such as internal restructurings, losses on subleases, arbitration awards, and debt refinancings) that are not allocated to any particular segment since they historically have not regularly impacted our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance on a regular basis.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits represent expenses and credits related to our chief executive officer and Board of Directors, certain provisions for bad debt allowances or subsequent recoveries such as those related to bankrupt clients, defined benefit pension costs or credits for our frozen U.S. pension plan, and certain self-insurance costs and recoveries that are not allocated to our individual operating segments.\nAdditional discussion and analysis of our income taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, goodwill impairment, restructuring and special charges follows the discussion and analysis of the results of operations of our four operating segments.\nSegment Revenues\nIn the normal course of business, our operating segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by our clients. Under GAAP, these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are required to be included when reporting expenses and revenues, respectively, in our consolidated results of operations. In the discussion and analysis of results of operations which follows, we do not include a gross up of expenses and revenues for these pass-through reimbursed expenses. The amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in our results of operations with no impact to our net income or operating earnings. A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to consolidated revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is self-evident from the face of the accompanying statements of income. Unless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses.\nSegment Expenses\nOur discussion and analysis of segment operating expenses is comprised of two components. \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\".\n\"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits provided to the employees of each segment, as well as payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff in each segment. As a service company, these costs represent our most significant and variable operating expenses. In our International and Garden City Group segments, these costs include direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits of certain administrative functions that are embedded in those locations and are considered direct operating costs of those locations. In our U.S. Services and Broadspire operations, certain administrative functions are performed by centralized headquarters staff. These costs are considered indirect and are not included in \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\". Accordingly, the \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" components are not comparable across segments, but are comparable within each segment across periods.\nThe allocated indirect costs of our shared-services infrastructure are included in \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" In addition to allocated corporate and shared costs, \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes travel and entertainment, office rent and occupancy costs, automobile expenses, office operating expenses, data processing costs, cost of risk, professional fees, and amortization and depreciation expense other than amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets.\nUnless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses and expense amounts exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nOperating results for our segments reconciled to income before income taxes and net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company, are as shown in the following table.\n\nnm = not meaningful\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nU.S. SERVICES SEGMENT\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings for our U.S. Services segment increased from $18.0 million in 2014 to $32.7 million in 2015, representing an operating margin of 13.5% in 2015 compared with 8.4% in 2014. Operating earnings improved 81.3% from 2014 to 2015 due to an increase in revenues and the impact of cost reduction initiatives in 2015.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues are primarily generated from the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. U.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\n\nThe increase in U.S. Claims Services revenues in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to an increase in revenues in the U.S. Catastrophe Services service line resulting from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. Claims Field Operations service line revenues due to a reduction of weather-related case volumes. The outsourcing project resulted in $51.3 million in revenues in 2015, compared with $22.1 million in 2014, responsible for a 13.6% positive variance in revenues for 2015 compared with 2014. The variance in revenues was negatively impacted by approximately $4.5 million, or 2.1% of 2014 revenues, as a result of the January 1, 2015 transfer of affinity claims which are now handled by our Broadspire segment. There was also an increase in revenues in the U.S. Technical Services service line due to an increase in case volumes in 2015. Changes in the overall mix of services provided and rates charged for those services increased revenues by approximately 3.9% in 2015 compared with 2014. All of these factors netted to positively impact revenues, before the impact from the decrease in cases discussed below.\nU.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased 17.4% in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the ongoing expansion of this service as an alternative property claims service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks. There was also an increase in the average fee per claim in 2015 compared to 2014.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $8.2 million in 2015, decreasing from $9.6 million in 2014. The decrease in reimbursements is related to the reduction in revenues in U.S. Claims Field Operations. The outsourcing project in U.S. Claims Services discussed above was a primary source of the 2015 revenue increase but does not have reimbursed expenses.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\n\nThe",
    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand Crawford & Company, our operations, and our business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As described in Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,\" of those accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, financial results from our operations outside of the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, and certain subsidiaries in the Philippines, are reported and consolidated on a two-month delayed basis in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, \"Consolidation,\" in order to provide sufficient time for accumulation of their results. Accordingly, the Company's December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 consolidated financial statements include the financial position of such operations as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal periods ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nBusiness Overview\nBased in Atlanta, Georgia, Crawford & Company (www.crawfordandcompany.com) is one of the world's largest independent providers of claims management solutions to the risk management and insurance industry, as well as to self-insured entities, with an expansive global network serving clients in more than 70 countries. The Crawford SolutionSM offers comprehensive, integrated claims services, business process outsourcing and consulting services for major product lines including property and casualty claims management, workers' compensation claims and medical management, and legal settlement administration.\nShares of the Company's two classes of common stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbols CRDA and CRDB, respectively. The Company's two classes of stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting rights and the Company's ability to pay greater cash dividends on the non-voting Class A Common Stock than on the voting Class B Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. In addition, with respect to mergers or similar transactions, holders of Class A Common Stock must receive the same type and amount of consideration as holders of Class B Common Stock, unless different consideration is approved by the holders of 75% of the Class A Common Stock, voting as a class.\nAs discussed in more detail in subsequent sections of this MD&A, we have four operating segments: U.S. Services, International, Broadspire, and Garden City Group. Our four operating segments represent components of our Company for which separate financial information is available, and which is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company realigned two of its reportable segments by moving its Canada and Latin America/Caribbean operations from the former Americas segment to the newly formed International segment, previously referred to as the EMEA/AP (Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific) segment. The former Americas segment, without Canada and Latin America/Caribbean, is now the U.S. Services segment. The results of the former EMEA/AP and Americas segments are no longer reported separately. U.S. Services primarily serves the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. International serves the property and casualty insurance company and self-insurance markets outside the U.S. Broadspire serves the U.S. self-insurance marketplace. Garden City Group serves the class action, regulatory, mass tort, bankruptcy, and other legal administration markets, primarily in the U.S. The results of prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation of our reportable segments. The change in reporting segments did not have any impact on previously reported consolidated financial results.\nInsurance companies, which represent the major source of our global revenues, customarily manage their own claims administration function but often rely on third parties for certain services which we provide, primarily field investigation and the evaluation of property and casualty insurance claims. We are also experiencing increased utilization by insurance companies of the managed repair network provided by our Contractor Connection division.\nSelf-insured entities typically rely on us for a broader range of services. In addition to field investigation and claims evaluation, we may also provide initial loss reporting services for their claimants, loss mitigation services such as medical bill review, medical case management and vocational rehabilitation, risk management information services, and trust fund administration to pay their claims.\nWe also perform legal settlement administration services related to securities, product liability, and other class action settlements and bankruptcies, including identifying and qualifying class members, determining and dispensing settlement payments, and administering settlement funds.\nThe global claims management services market is highly competitive and comprised of a large number of companies of varying size and that offer a varied scope of services. The demand from insurance companies and self-insured entities for services provided by independent claims service firms like us is largely dependent on industry-wide claims volumes, which are affected by, among other things, the insurance underwriting cycle, weather-related events, general economic activity, overall employment levels, and workplace injury rates. Demand is also impacted by decisions insurance companies and self-insured entities may make with respect to the level of claims outsourced to independent claim service firms as opposed to those handled by their own in-house claims adjusters. In addition, our ability to retain clients and maintain or increase case referrals is also dependent in part on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, competitively priced services and effective sales efforts.\nWe typically earn our revenues on an individual fee-per-claim basis for claims management services we provide to insurance companies and self-insured entities. Accordingly, the volume of claim referrals to us is a key driver of our revenues. Generally, fees are earned on cases as services are provided, which generally occurs in the period the case is assigned to us, although sometimes a portion or substantially all of the revenues generated by a specific case assignment will be earned in subsequent periods. We cannot predict the future trend of case volumes for a number of reasons, including the frequency and severity of weather-related cases and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of cases for us and are not subject to accurate forecasting.\nThe legal settlement administration market within which our Garden City Group segment operates is also highly competitive but is comprised of a smaller number of specialized entities. The demand for legal settlement administration services is generally not directly tied to or affected by the insurance underwriting cycle. The demand for these services is largely dependent on the volume of securities and product liability class action settlements, the volume of bankruptcy filings and the resulting settlements, volume of mass torts and general economic conditions. Our revenues for legal settlement administration services are largely project-based and we earn these revenues as we perform individual tasks and deliver the outputs as outlined in each project.\nOn December 1, 2014, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of GAB Robins, a loss adjusting and claims management provider headquartered in the U.K. which reports through our International segment. We believe the GAB Robins acquisition enables Crawford to significantly expand its claims handling business across a wide range of product lines in the U.K. and bolster its global specialty lines claims business. The success of the GAB Robins acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies and cost savings from integrating GAB Robins on a timely basis. The integration process continues to be complex, costly, and time-consuming, and no assurances of the success of the process can be provided. Because the financial results of certain of our international subsidiaries, including those in the U.K. through which GAB Robins reports, are included in our consolidated financial statements on a two-month delayed basis as described above, the results of GAB Robins' business are included in our consolidated results of operations beginning February 1, 2015. In addition, the $78.4 million in Credit Facility borrowings used to complete the GAB Robins acquisition were not included in outstanding borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014, because the U.K.-based borrowing entity has an October 31 fiscal year end, and the balance sheet of that entity was consolidated as of October 31, 2014.\nIn 2014, we established a wholly-owned global business services center in Manila, Philippines. We have subsequently expanded the capabilities of the center to include Information Technology services performed in Pune, India (the \"Centers\"). The Centers provide us venues for global consolidation of certain business functions, shared services, and currently outsourced processes. The Centers, which are expected to be phased in through 2018, are expected to allow us to continue to strengthen our client service, realize additional operational efficiencies, and invest in new capabilities for growth. Operations in the Centers are expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of approximately $60 million through 2019 and annual cost savings of approximately $20 million per year thereafter. To achieve these savings, we expect to record charges totaling approximately $20 million through 2018. An initial charge of $4.4 million was incurred in 2015, which was partially offset by initial savings in 2015 of approximately $2 million. We expect to record charges of $8.4 million in 2016, which should be partially offset by combined savings in 2016 of $8 million. No assurances can be provided of our ability to timely or cost effectively complete and ramp up operations at the Centers, or to achieve expected cost savings on a timely basis, or at all.\nIn 2015 we also announced various restructuring plans intended to, among other things, reduce overhead costs in certain functions and in our business segments, and streamline senior management to reduce costs and further improve execution. These plans included integration costs related to the GAB Robins acquisition and other special charges discussed in Note 16, \"Restructuring and Special Charges\" to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring and special charges associated with these plans totaled $30.0 million in 2015, and another $7.2 million of costs are expected in 2016.\nGoodwill impairment charges for 2015 were $49.3 million. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2014 or 2013. See Note 1, \"Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\" and Note 3, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion about the 2015 goodwill impairment charges.\nResults of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated revenues before reimbursements were $1.170 billion in 2015, an increase of 2.4% compared with $1.143 billion in 2014. Net loss attributable to Crawford & Company was $(45.5) million in 2015, compared with net income of $30.6 million in 2014 and $51.0 million in 2013. During 2015, the Company recorded restructuring and special charges of $34.4 million. The Company also recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $49.3 million in 2015. There were no similar charges in 2014 or 2013.\nSegment operating earnings (a measure of segment operating performance used by our management that is defined and discussed in more detail below) improved in our U.S. Services and Broadspire segments from 2013 to 2014 and from 2014 to 2015, while we experienced operating earnings declines in our International and Garden City Group segments in those periods.\nCompared with 2014, our consolidated revenues before reimbursements were 2.4% higher in 2015 due primarily to revenue growth in U.S. Services and Broadspire, and the GAB Robins acquisition in International, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, and lower revenues at Garden City Group.\nIn the U.S. Services segment, operating earnings improved from 2014 to 2015 due to continued growth in our U.S. Contractor Connection managed repair network, growth in U.S. Catastrophe Services primarily due to an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, and cost reduction initiatives in 2015. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in weather related cases in the U.S. Claims Field Operations in 2015.\nOperating earnings in our International segment declined in 2015 compared to 2014, due to a reduction in weather-related claim activity and decline in high-frequency, low-complexity claims in the U.K. and Asia-Pacific in 2015, and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nBroadspire's operating earnings improved each year from 2013 to 2015. The improvements were due to higher revenues from both new and existing clients, and improved control over operating expenses.\nAs expected, Garden City Group's operating earnings declined in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting a decline in revenues from certain special projects. The Garden City Group had lower revenues in 2015 from the Deepwater Horizon class action settlement project and another non-Gulf related special project, compared with 2014. Operating earnings were higher in this segment in both 2014 and 2013, compared with 2015, due to these special projects.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were 1.6% higher in 2015 than in 2014 and 2.4% higher in 2014 than in 2013. The increase in 2015 was attributable to increases in SG&A expenses from the GAB Robins acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. The increase in 2014 was due to an increase in acquisition-related costs, professional fees and self-insurance expense, partially offset by a decrease in short-term and long-term incentive compensation costs.\nSegment Operating Earnings of our Operating Segments\nWe believe that a discussion and analysis of the segment operating earnings of our four operating segments is helpful in understanding the results of our operations. Operating earnings is our segment measure of profitability as discussed in Note 13, \"Segment and Geographic Information,\" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by our senior management and CODM to evaluate the financial performance of our operating segments and make resource allocation decisions.\nWe believe operating earnings is a measure that is useful to others in that it allows them to evaluate segment operating performance using the same criteria used by our senior management and CODM. Segment operating earnings represent segment earnings, including the direct and indirect costs of certain administrative functions required to operate our business but excludes unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, goodwill impairment, restructuring and special charges, income taxes, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nFor most of our international operations and for Garden City Group, many administrative functions, such as finance, human resources, information technology, quality and compliance, are embedded in those locations and are considered direct costs of those operations. For our domestic operations (primarily Broadspire and the U.S. Services segments), we have a centralized shared-services arrangement for most of these administrative functions, and we allocate the costs of those services to the segments as indirect costs based on usage. Although some of the administrative services in our shared-services center benefit, and are allocated to, more than one of our operating segments, the majority of these shared services are allocated to the Broadspire and U.S. Services segments.\nIncome taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, and amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets are recurring components of our net income, but they are not considered part of our segment operating earnings because they are managed on a corporate-wide basis. Income taxes are calculated for the Company on a consolidated basis based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which we provide services, and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Net corporate interest expense results from capital structure decisions made by senior management and the Board of Directors and affecting the Company as a whole. Stock option expense represents the non-cash costs generally related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan expenses which are not allocated to our operating segments. Amortization expense is a non-cash expense for customer-relationship intangible assets acquired in business combinations. None of these costs relate directly to the performance of our services or operating activities and, therefore, are excluded from segment operating earnings in order to better assess the results of each segment's operating activities on a consistent basis.\nAlthough associated with particular operating segments, goodwill impairment charges are not allocated to any particular segment since they do not impact our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance.\nRestructuring and special charges arise from time to time from events (such as internal restructurings, losses on subleases, arbitration awards, and debt refinancings) that are not allocated to any particular segment since they historically have not regularly impacted our performance and are not expected to impact our future performance on a regular basis.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits represent expenses and credits related to our chief executive officer and Board of Directors, certain provisions for bad debt allowances or subsequent recoveries such as those related to bankrupt clients, defined benefit pension costs or credits for our frozen U.S. pension plan, and certain self-insurance costs and recoveries that are not allocated to our individual operating segments.\nAdditional discussion and analysis of our income taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, goodwill impairment, restructuring and special charges follows the discussion and analysis of the results of operations of our four operating segments.\nSegment Revenues\nIn the normal course of business, our operating segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by our clients. Under GAAP, these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are required to be included when reporting expenses and revenues, respectively, in our consolidated results of operations. In the discussion and analysis of results of operations which follows, we do not include a gross up of expenses and revenues for these pass-through reimbursed expenses. The amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in our results of operations with no impact to our net income or operating earnings. A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to consolidated revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is self-evident from the face of the accompanying statements of income. Unless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses.\nSegment Expenses\nOur discussion and analysis of segment operating expenses is comprised of two components. \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\".\n\"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits provided to the employees of each segment, as well as payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff in each segment. As a service company, these costs represent our most significant and variable operating expenses. In our International and Garden City Group segments, these costs include direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits of certain administrative functions that are embedded in those locations and are considered direct operating costs of those locations. In our U.S. Services and Broadspire operations, certain administrative functions are performed by centralized headquarters staff. These costs are considered indirect and are not included in \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\". Accordingly, the \"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" and \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" components are not comparable across segments, but are comparable within each segment across periods.\nThe allocated indirect costs of our shared-services infrastructure are included in \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor.\" In addition to allocated corporate and shared costs, \"Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits & Non-Employee Labor\" includes travel and entertainment, office rent and occupancy costs, automobile expenses, office operating expenses, data processing costs, cost of risk, professional fees, and amortization and depreciation expense other than amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets.\nUnless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses and expense amounts exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses.\nOperating results for our segments reconciled to income before income taxes and net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company, are as shown in the following table.\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

13.5% in 2015 compared with 8.4% in 2014. Operating earnings improved 81.3% from 2014 to 2015 due to an increase in revenues and the impact of cost reduction initiatives in 2015.\nRevenues before Reimbursements\nU.S. Services revenues are primarily generated from the property and casualty insurance company markets in the U.S. U.S. Services revenues before reimbursements by major service line were as follows:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>28,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>76,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>183,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>59,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Revenues before Reimbursements\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in U.S. Claims Services revenues in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to an increase in revenues in the U.S. Catastrophe Services service line resulting from an outsourcing project for a major U.S. insurance carrier, partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. Claims Field Operations service line revenues due to a reduction of weather-related case volumes. The outsourcing project resulted in $51.3 million in revenues in 2015, compared with $22.1 million in 2014, responsible for a 13.6% positive variance in revenues for 2015 compared with 2014. The variance in revenues was negatively impacted by approximately $4.5 million, or 2.1% of 2014 revenues, as a result of the January 1, 2015 transfer of affinity claims which are now handled by our Broadspire segment. There was also an increase in revenues in the U.S. Technical Services service line due to an increase in case volumes in 2015. Changes in the overall mix of services provided and rates charged for those services increased revenues by approximately 3.9% in 2015 compared with 2014. All of these factors netted to positively impact revenues, before the impact from the decrease in cases discussed below.\nU.S. Contractor Connection revenues increased 17.4% in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the ongoing expansion of this service as an alternative property claims service solution as insurance carriers continued the trend of moving high-frequency, low-complexity property cases directly to managed repair networks. There was also an increase in the average fee per claim in 2015 compared to 2014.\nReimbursed Expenses Included in Total Revenues\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our U.S. Services segment which are included in total Company revenues were $8.2 million in 2015, decreasing from $9.6 million in 2014. The decrease in reimbursements is related to the reduction in revenues in U.S. Claims Field Operations. The outsourcing project in U.S. Claims Services discussed above was a primary source of the 2015 revenue increase but does not have reimbursed expenses.\nCase Volume Analysis\nU.S. Services unit volumes by underlying case category, as measured by cases received, for 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Claims Field Operations\n</td> <td>148,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>219,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Technical Services\n</td> <td>7,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Catastrophe Services\n</td> <td>32,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal U.S. Claims Services\n</td> <td>187,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Contractor Connection\n</td> <td>194,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. Services Cases Received\n</td> <td>382,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe"
