Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results or timing of certain events could differ materially from the results or timing described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a precision therapy company focused on genomically defined cancers, rare diseases and cancer immunotherapy. Our approach is to leverage our novel target discovery engine to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases and to craft highly selective and potent drug candidates that may provide significant and durable clinical responses for patients without adequate treatment options. This integrated biology and chemistry approach enables us to identify, characterize and design drug candidates to inhibit novel kinase targets that have been difficult to selectively inhibit. We believe that our uniquely targeted, scalable approach empowers the rapid design and development of new treatments and increases the likelihood of success.\nOur most advanced drug candidates are avapritinib, BLU-667, BLU-554 and BLU-782. Our lead drug candidate, avapritinib, is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets KIT and PDGFRA mutations. These mutations abnormally activate receptor tyrosine kinases that are drivers of cancer and proliferative disorders, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, and systemic mastocytosis, or SM. GIST is a rare disease that is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the gastrointestinal tract, or GI tract, and SM is a rare disorder that causes an overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs, which can lead to a wide range of debilitating symptoms and organ dysfunction and failure. We are currently evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of GIST in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced GIST, which we refer to\nas our NAVIGATOR trial, and an ongoing global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial comparing avapritinib to regorafenib in third-line GIST, which we refer to as our VOYAGER trial. We have completed enrollment of the NAVIGATOR trial, and we plan to present additional data from this trial in the second quarter of 2019. We expect to complete enrollment of the VOYAGER trial in the second half of 2019. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 precision medicine trial in second-line GIST in the second half of 2019, which we refer to as our COMPASS-2L trial. In addition, we plan to submit a new drug application, or NDA, for avapritinib for the treatment of PDGFRA Exon 18 mutant GIST and fourth-line GIST in the second quarter of 2019, and we plan to submit a supplemental NDA for the treatment of third-line GIST in 2020. We are currently evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of SM in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our EXPLORER trial, an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our PATHFINDER trial, and an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in indolent and smoldering SM, which we refer to as our PIONEER trial. We plan to present updated data from the EXPLORER trial in advanced SM in the second quarter of 2019, and we plan to present initial data from the PIONEER trial in indolent and smoldering SM in the second half of 2019. We expect to complete enrollment of the PATHFINDER trial in the second half of 2019. We plan to submit an NDA for advanced SM in 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and the treatment of mastocytosis, and the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and the treatment of mastocytosis. The FDA has granted fast track designation to avapritinib for (i) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST that progressed following treatment with imatinib and a second TKI and (ii) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with the PDGFRA D842V mutation regardless of prior therapy. In addition, the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation and to avapritinib for the treatment of advanced SM, including the subtypes of aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia.\nBLU-667 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is abnormally activated by mutations or fusions and RET resistance mutations that we predict will arise from treatment with first generation therapies. RET drives disease in subsets of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and cancers of the thyroid, including medullary thyroid carcinoma, or MTC, and papillary thyroid cancer, or PTC, and our research suggests that RET may drive disease in subsets of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer and other cancers. We are currently evaluating BLU-667 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with RET-altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors, which we refer to as our ARROW trial. We expect to complete enrollment of the previously treated NSCLC and MTC cohorts in the ARROW trial in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, we plan to present updated data from the ongoing ARROW trial in the second quarter of 2019. We plan to submit an NDA for BLU-667 in the first half of 2020 based on additional data from the ongoing ARROW trial and currently expect the NDA submission will be for separate potential indications: (1) patients with RET-fusion positive NSCLC who have progressed following prior systemic therapy and (2) patients with RET-mutant MTC who have progressed following treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. In addition, in the second half of 2019, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating BLU-667 in first-line RET-altered NSCLC and plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating BLU-667 in combination with osimertinib in treatment-resistant, EGFR-mutant NSCLC harboring an acquired RET alteration. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to BLU-667 for the treatment of RET-rearranged NSCLC, JAK1/2-positive NSCLC or TRKC-positive NSCLC, and the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to BLU-667 for the treatment of patients with RET mutation-positive MTC that requires systemic treatment and for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments.\nBLU-554 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets FGFR4, a kinase that is aberrantly activated in a defined subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, the most common type of liver cancer. We are currently evaluating BLU-554 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC. We and CStone Pharmaceuticals, or CStone, plan to expand our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of BLU-554 to include clinical sites in Mainland China by the middle of 2019. In addition, we and CStone plan to initiate a proof-of-concept clinical trial in the second half of 2019 in the CStone territory evaluating BLU-554 in combination with CS1001, a clinical stage anti-programmed death ligand-1 immunotherapy being developed by CStone, as a first-line therapy for the treatment of patients with HCC. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to BLU-554 for the treatment of HCC.\nBLU-782 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets mutant activin-like kinase 2, or ALK2. We are developing BLU-782 for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, a rare, severely disabling genetic disease caused by mutations in the ALK2 gene, ACVR1. FOP is characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification, which is the abnormal transformation of muscle, ligaments and tendons into bone. Heterotopic\nossification may be spontaneous or associated with painful episodic disease flare-ups that are usually precipitated by soft tissue injury. As the disease progresses, extra-skeletal bone increasingly restricts joints, resulting in severe disability and loss of mobility, compromised respiratory function and increased risk of early death. Currently, there are no approved therapies for FOP. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2019, and we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating BLU-782 in patients with FOP in the first half of 2020. The FDA has granted fast track designation to BLU-782 for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.\nWe also plan to continue to leverage our discovery platform to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and craft drug candidates that potently and selectively target these kinases. We currently have four wholly-owned discovery programs for undisclosed kinase targets, and we anticipate nominating at least one additional wholly-owned discovery program in 2019.\nIn addition, we entered into collaborations with F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann La Roche Inc., which we collectively refer to as Roche, and CStone in March 2016 and June 2018, respectively. Under our collaboration agreement with Roche, we are seeking to discover, develop and commercialize up to five small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy, as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics. Under our collaboration agreement with CStone, we are seeking to develop and commercialize BLU-554, avapritinib and BLU-667, including back-up forms and certain other forms, in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the CStone territory, either as a monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy. We will continue to evaluate additional collaborations that could maximize the value for our programs and allow us to leverage the expertise of strategic collaborators. We are also focused on engaging in collaborations to capitalize on our discovery platform outside of our primary strategic focus area of cancer.\nWe currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to avapritinib, BLU-667 and BLU-554 other than the rights licensed to CStone in the CStone territory. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to BLU-782 and all of our discovery programs other than the discovery-stage programs under the Roche collaboration.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations and a debt financing. Through December 31, 2018, we have received an aggregate of $1.1 billion from such transactions, including $887.4 million in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our May 2015 initial public offering, or IPO, and December 2016, April 2017 and December 2017 follow-on public offerings, $115.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $18.8 million of upfront and milestone payments under our former collaboration with Alexion Pharma Holding, or Alexion, $55.0 million in upfront and milestone payments under our existing collaboration with Roche, a $40.0 million upfront payment under our existing collaboration with CStone, and $10.0 million in gross proceeds from the debt financing.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $236.6 million, $148.1 million and $72.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $597.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinue to advance and initiate clinical development activities for our lead drug candidate, avapritinib, as well as our other most advanced drug candidates, BLU-667, BLU-554 and BLU-782;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nseek marketing approvals for our drug candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinue to manufacture increasing quantities of drug substance and drug product material for use in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and for any potential commercialization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinue to discover, validate and develop additional drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nconduct research and development activities under our collaborations with Roche and CStone;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nconduct development and commercialization activities for companion diagnostic tests for current or future drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nacquire or in-license other drug candidates or technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhire additional research, clinical, quality, manufacturing, regulatory, commercial and general and administrative personnel; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nincur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from drug sales. Our revenue consists of collaboration revenue under our former collaboration with Alexion, which was terminated in October 2017, and our existing collaborations with Roche and CStone, including amounts that are recognized related to upfront payments, milestone payments and amounts due to us for research and development services. In the future, revenue may include revenues related to the supply of our drug candidates or products to CStone for development and commercialization activities in the CStone territory and additional milestone payments and royalties on any net product sales under our collaborations with Roche and CStone. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of avapritinib until 2020, assuming we are able to file for regulatory approval for avapritinib in the United States in the second quarter of 2019 and receive marketing approval by 2020. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of product sales, if any, license fees, research and development services and related reimbursements, payments for manufacturing services, and milestone and other payments.\nIn the future, subject to obtaining marketing approval for one or more of our drug candidates, we expect to generate revenue from a combination of product sales, royalties on product sales and cost reimbursements, as well as upfront, milestone and royalty payments, if any, under any current or future collaborations\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our drug candidates, which include:\nTable 228: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nemployee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, pre-clinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses incurred under agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of companion diagnostic tests;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost of consultants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost associated with regulatory quality assurance and quality control operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical study materials, clinical trial materials and commercial supply materials; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfacilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other operating costs in support of research and development activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nThe successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these drug candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 235: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nestablishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsuccessful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nreceipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nestablishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncommercializing the drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncontinued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our drug candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. In addition, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nA significant portion of our research and development expenses have been external expenses, which we track on a program-by-program basis following nomination as a development candidate. Our internal research and development expenses are primarily personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense. Except for internal research and development expenses related to collaboration agreements, we do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects under development.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Other development and pre-development candidate expenses, unallocated expenses and internal research and development expenses have been classified separately.\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAvapritinib external expenses\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n83,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBLU-554 external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBLU-667 external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBLU-782 external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther development and pre-development candidate expenses and unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n49,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n243,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with our clinical trials and preparing regulatory filings. These increases will likely include the costs related to the implementation and expansion of clinical trial sites and related patient enrollment, monitoring, program management and drug product and drug substance manufacturing expenses for current and future clinical trials. In addition, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we incur additional costs in connection with research and development activities under our collaboration with Roche, development activities under our collaboration with CStone and development activities for companion diagnostic tests for current and future drug candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, commercial, business development, information technology, legal and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, pre-commercial development activities, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and planned commercialization activities, including establishing a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, legal, auditing and filing fees and general compliance and consulting expenses, among other expenses. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company and expanding the scope of our operations.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of income earned on cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense on amounts outstanding under a loan and security agreement that we entered into with Silicon Valley Bank in May 2013 and amortization of debt discount. We made our final loan payment in 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding principal and interest under the loan and security agreement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are those policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses, available-for-sale investments and stock-based compensation.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we refer to as ASC 606, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. We only applied the modified retrospective transition method to contracts that were not completed as January 1, 2018, the effective date of adoption for ASC 606. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe enter into licensing agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which we may exclusively license rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above; (b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and (c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties and sales-based milestones, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nExclusive Licenses. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a promise or performance obligation is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nResearch and Development Services. The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by our employees on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts. Reimbursements from and payments to the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nCustomer Options. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options that are not determined to be material rights are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised.\nMilestone Payments. At the inception of each arrangement that includes research or development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nRoyalties. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments upon first commercial sales and milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nCollaborative Arrangements. We analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and therefore within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, which we refer to as ASC 808. This assessment is performed throughout the life\nof the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and which elements of the collaboration are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to ASC 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaboration revenues as such amounts are incurred by the collaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaboration revenues in each quarterly period, such amounts are classified as research and development expense. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, we apply the five-step model described above under ASC 606.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments\nWe classify marketable securities with a remaining maturity when purchased of greater than three months as available-for-sale. Marketable securities with a remaining maturity date greater than one year are classified as non-current. Available-for-sale securities are maintained by an investment manager and may consist of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government agency securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity until realized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the instrument. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in value of the investment, we consider all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other-than-temporary\u201d and, if so, mark the investment to market through a charge to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation -Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. We expense the fair value of stock awards granted to employees and members of the board\nof directors over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. Prior to 2017, expense was recognized net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures. Effective January 1, 2017, upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation under the modified retrospective approach, we began recognizing gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur. Compensation cost for restricted stock awards issued to employees is measured using the grant date intrinsic value of the award and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures. We estimate the fair value of options granted to employees at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\nTable 243: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpected volatility, which is calculated based on reported volatility data for a representative group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. For these analyses, we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We intend to consistently apply this process using representative companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrisk-free interest rate, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpected term, which we calculate using the simplified method, as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, as we have insufficient historical information regarding our stock options to provide a basis for an estimate. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the contractual term of ten years and the weighted-average vesting term of the stock options, taking into consideration multiple vesting tranches;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndividend yield, which is zero based on the fact that we never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock-based awards issued to non-employees, including directors for non-board-related services, are accounted for based on the fair value of such services received or of the intrinsic value of equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. The measurement date for non-employee awards is the date of grant without changes in the fair value of the award. Stock-based awards subject to service-based vesting conditions are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\nThe purchase price of common stock under our 2015 employee stock purchase plan, or 2015 ESPP, is equal to 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value per share of the common stock on the first business day of an offering period and (ii) the fair market value per share of the common stock on the purchase date. The fair value of the discounted purchases made under our 2015 ESPP is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of the look-back provision plus the 15% discount is recognized as compensation expense over the 180-day purchase period.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCollaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n44,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n243,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n144,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n98,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n291,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n172,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(73)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(221)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(67)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(236,642)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(148,119)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(88,523)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue increased by $23.1 million from $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to the CStone and Roche agreements. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was related to the Roche and Alexion agreements. We recorded $4.5 million and $5.2 million in collaboration revenue under the Roche agreement for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 and the resulting change in the revenue recognition pattern. We entered into the CStone agreement on June 1, 2018 and recorded collaboration revenue of $40.0 million under the CStone agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recorded collaboration revenue of $16.2 million under the Alexion agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the termination of the agreement during 2017, we did not recognize any revenue under the Alexion agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $98.9 million from $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to the following:\nTable 248: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $35.3 million in increased expenses for external clinical activities related to avapritinib and BLU-667;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $27.5 million in increased personnel expense, primarily due to an increase in headcount, which was driven by growth in the clinical and manufacturing organizations as we advance our lead drug candidates, and an increase of $10.7 million in stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $27.3 million in increased expenses associated with clinical and commercial manufacturing activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $5.6 million in increased expenses associated with continuing to build our discovery platform and advance our discovery pipeline; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $2.8 million in increased toxicology studies, including IND-enabling pre-clinical studies related to BLU-782.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $19.9 million from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to the following:\nTable 253: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $11.1 million in increased personnel expenses, primarily due to an increase in general and administrative headcount to support our overall growth as a publicly traded company and an increase of $7.3 million in stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $6.1 million in increased professional fees including pre-commercial planning activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $2.1 million in increased facility costs related to our new headquarters in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net, increased by $7.1 million from $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to higher average investment balances and a higher rate of return on investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by $0.1 million from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the average outstanding principle balance under the loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank for the year ended December 31, 2018. We made our final loan payment in 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding principal and interest under the loan and security agreement.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCollaboration revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,346)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(23)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n144,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n81,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n172,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n72,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(221)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(469)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(53)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(148,119)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(72,495)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(75,624)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue decreased by $6.3 million from $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was related to the former collaboration with Alexion and the existing collaboration with Roche. We recorded collaboration revenue of $16.2 million and $23.3 million under the Alexion collaboration for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Collaboration revenue under our former collaboration with Alexion began in March\n2015 upon the execution of the Alexion collaboration agreement. The decrease was primarily due to lower reimbursable research and development expenses as a result of the termination of the agreement and the impact of the recognition of two milestone payments upon achievement included in the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the termination of the Alexion collaboration, we recognized the remaining deferred revenue balance related to the upfront payment and non-substantive milestone payment previously received under the collaboration utilizing the proportional performance model over the remaining period of performance, which ended October 24, 2017. We entered into the Roche agreement in March 2016 and recorded $5.2 million and $4.5 million in collaboration revenue under the Roche collaboration for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased by $63.6 million from $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in research and development expense was primarily related to the following:\nTable 257: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $24.7 million in increased expenses associated with clinical and commercial manufacturing activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $20.3 million in increased expenses for external clinical activities related to avapritinib, BLU-667 and BLU-554, further through Phase 1 clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $15.0 million in increased personnel expense primarily due to a 35% increase in headcount and an increase of $3.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, which were driven by growth in the clinical and manufacturing organizations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproximately $0.9 million in increased expenses associated with continuing to build our discovery platform and advance our discovery pipeline.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $8.8 million from $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The increase in other income, net, was primarily related to an increase in investment income during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by $0.2 million from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the average outstanding principle balance under the loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank for the year ended December 31, 2017. We made our final loan payment in 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding principal and interest under the loan and security agreement.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations and a debt financing.\nThrough December 31, 2018, we have received an aggregate of $1.1 billion from such transactions, including $887.4 million in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our May 2015 IPO and December 2016, April 2017 and December 2017 follow-on public offerings, $115.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $18.8 million of upfront and milestone payments from Alexion, $55.0 million in upfront and milestone payments from Roche, a $40.0 million upfront payment under our existing collaboration with CStone and $10.0 million in gross proceeds from the debt financing.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $494.0 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(175,009)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(119,865)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(24,513)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(161,088)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(72,347)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(218,821)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n543,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n132,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(331,643)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n351,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(110,757)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the $55.1 million increase in net cash used in operating was primarily due to the increase in net loss during this period of $88.5 million, which was driven by increased payroll and payroll-related expenses and spending on pre-clinical, clinical and pre-commercial activities, partially offset by upfront and milestone payments received during year ended December 31, 2018. The net cash flows provided by operating activities for year ended December 31, 2018 reflect a $40.0 million upfront payment received under the CStone agreement and a $10.0 milestone payment received under the Roche agreement. We did not receive any upfront payments or milestones during year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, the $95.4 million increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net loss of $75.6 million for the year end December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as changes in deferred revenue related to the timing and amount of upfront payment from Roche. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we received a $45.0 million upfront payment from Roche compared to no upfront payments received during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the $88.7 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, the $146.5 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of available-for-sale investments which was partially offset by purchases of property and equipment that mainly related to the relocation of our headquarters.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the $539.5 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a total of $541.5 million decrease in net proceeds received from our April 2017 and December 2017 follow-on underwritten public offerings, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us, partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, the $411.4 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to $406.3 million increase in net proceeds from public offerings, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, and $4.3 million increase in proceeds received for the issuance of common stock.\nBorrowings\nIn May 2013, we entered into the loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. Under the terms of the loan and security agreement, we borrowed $5.0 million. Loan advances under the loan and security agreement accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.0% above the prime rate. In November 2014, we amended the loan and security agreement and borrowed an additional $5.0 million. Each loan advance included an interest-only payment period. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we paid principal payments of $1.5 million, $2.6 million, and $3.3 million, respectively, on the $10.0 million of advances. We were required to pay a fee of 4% of the total loan advances at the end of the term of the loan. There were no financial covenants associated with the loan and security agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding principal and interest under the loan and security agreement.\nSee Note 9, Term Loan,\u201d in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue and initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our drug candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our drug candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential collaborators. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $494.0 million. Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, excluding any potential option fees and milestone payments under our existing collaborations with Roche and CStone, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2020. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 264: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, pre-clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of securing and producing drug substance and drug product material for use in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and for use as commercial supply;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe success of our collaborations with Roche and CStone;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe success of our current or future companion diagnostic test collaborations for companion diagnostic tests;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under our collaboration agreements with Roche and CStone or any collaboration agreements that we may enter into in the future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other drug candidates and technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for development activities and commercial production;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of establishing operations outside the United States; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of establishing or contracting for sales, marketing and distribution capabilities if we obtain regulatory approvals to market our drug candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIdentifying potential drug candidates and conducting pre-clinical development and testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve drug sales. In addition, our drug candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial drug revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. At this time, we do not have any committed external source of funds other than potential funds to be earned under our collaborations with Roche and CStone. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2018:\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n154,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n88,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n154,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n88,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRepresents future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases, net of payments under our sublease for the office and laboratory space located at 38 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Certain of these agreements require us to pay milestones to such third parties upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones, which may not be achieved.\nWe also have obligations to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain milestones, including future payments to third parties with whom we have entered into agreements to develop and commercialize companion diagnostic tests for certain of our lead drug candidates. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet or in the table above because the achievement and timing of these milestones is not fixed and determinable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.", "summary": "This report provides a detailed overview of the company's financial and operational performance, highlighting the progress and future plans for drug candidates, including avapritinib, BLU-667, BLU-554, and BLU-782.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results or timing of certain events could differ materially from the results or timing described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a precision therapy company focused on genomically defined cancers, rare diseases and cancer immunotherapy. Our approach is to leverage our novel target discovery engine to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases and to craft highly selective and potent drug candidates that may provide significant and durable clinical responses for patients without adequate treatment options. This integrated biology and chemistry approach enables us to identify, characterize and design drug candidates to inhibit novel kinase targets that have been difficult to selectively inhibit. We believe that our uniquely targeted, scalable approach empowers the rapid design and development of new treatments and increases the likelihood of success.\nOur most advanced drug candidates are avapritinib, BLU-667, BLU-554 and BLU-782. Our lead drug candidate, avapritinib, is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets KIT and PDGFRA mutations. These mutations abnormally activate receptor tyrosine kinases that are drivers of cancer and proliferative disorders, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, and systemic mastocytosis, or SM. GIST is a rare disease that is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the gastrointestinal tract, or GI tract, and SM is a rare disorder that causes an overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs, which can lead to a wide range of debilitating symptoms and organ dysfunction and failure. We are currently evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of GIST in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced GIST, which we refer to\nas our NAVIGATOR trial, and an ongoing global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial comparing avapritinib to regorafenib in third-line GIST, which we refer to as our VOYAGER trial. We have completed enrollment of the NAVIGATOR trial, and we plan to present additional data from this trial in the second quarter of 2019. We expect to complete enrollment of the VOYAGER trial in the second half of 2019. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 precision medicine trial in second-line GIST in the second half of 2019, which we refer to as our COMPASS-2L trial. In addition, we plan to submit a new drug application, or NDA, for avapritinib for the treatment of PDGFRA Exon 18 mutant GIST and fourth-line GIST in the second quarter of 2019, and we plan to submit a supplemental NDA for the treatment of third-line GIST in 2020. We are currently evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of SM in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our EXPLORER trial, an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our PATHFINDER trial, and an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in indolent and smoldering SM, which we refer to as our PIONEER trial. We plan to present updated data from the EXPLORER trial in advanced SM in the second quarter of 2019, and we plan to present initial data from the PIONEER trial in indolent and smoldering SM in the second half of 2019. We expect to complete enrollment of the PATHFINDER trial in the second half of 2019. We plan to submit an NDA for advanced SM in 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and the treatment of mastocytosis, and the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and the treatment of mastocytosis. The FDA has granted fast track designation to avapritinib for (i) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST that progressed following treatment with imatinib and a second TKI and (ii) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with the PDGFRA D842V mutation regardless of prior therapy. In addition, the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation and to avapritinib for the treatment of advanced SM, including the subtypes of aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia.\nBLU-667 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is abnormally activated by mutations or fusions and RET resistance mutations that we predict will arise from treatment with first generation therapies. RET drives disease in subsets of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and cancers of the thyroid, including medullary thyroid carcinoma, or MTC, and papillary thyroid cancer, or PTC, and our research suggests that RET may drive disease in subsets of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer and other cancers. We are currently evaluating BLU-667 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with RET-altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors, which we refer to as our ARROW trial. We expect to complete enrollment of the previously treated NSCLC and MTC cohorts in the ARROW trial in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, we plan to present updated data from the ongoing ARROW trial in the second quarter of 2019. We plan to submit an NDA for BLU-667 in the first half of 2020 based on additional data from the ongoing ARROW trial and currently expect the NDA submission will be for separate potential indications: (1) patients with RET-fusion positive NSCLC who have progressed following prior systemic therapy and (2) patients with RET-mutant MTC who have progressed following treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. In addition, in the second half of 2019, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating BLU-667 in first-line RET-altered NSCLC and plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating BLU-667 in combination with osimertinib in treatment-resistant, EGFR-mutant NSCLC harboring an acquired RET alteration. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to BLU-667 for the treatment of RET-rearranged NSCLC, JAK1/2-positive NSCLC or TRKC-positive NSCLC, and the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to BLU-667 for the treatment of patients with RET mutation-positive MTC that requires systemic treatment and for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments.\nBLU-554 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets FGFR4, a kinase that is aberrantly activated in a defined subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, the most common type of liver cancer. We are currently evaluating BLU-554 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC. We and CStone Pharmaceuticals, or CStone, plan to expand our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of BLU-554 to include clinical sites in Mainland China by the middle of 2019. In addition, we and CStone plan to initiate a proof-of-concept clinical trial in the second half of 2019 in the CStone territory evaluating BLU-554 in combination with CS1001, a clinical stage anti-programmed death ligand-1 immunotherapy being developed by CStone, as a first-line therapy for the treatment of patients with HCC. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to BLU-554 for the treatment of HCC.\nBLU-782 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets mutant activin-like kinase 2, or ALK2. We are developing BLU-782 for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, a rare, severely disabling genetic disease caused by mutations in the ALK2 gene, ACVR1. FOP is characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification, which is the abnormal transformation of muscle, ligaments and tendons into bone. Heterotopic\nossification may be spontaneous or associated with painful episodic disease flare-ups that are usually precipitated by soft tissue injury. As the disease progresses, extra-skeletal bone increasingly restricts joints, resulting in severe disability and loss of mobility, compromised respiratory function and increased risk of early death. Currently, there are no approved therapies for FOP. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2019, and we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating BLU-782 in patients with FOP in the first half of 2020. The FDA has granted fast track designation to BLU-782 for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.\nWe also plan to continue to leverage our discovery platform to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and craft drug candidates that potently and selectively target these kinases. We currently have four wholly-owned discovery programs for undisclosed kinase targets, and we anticipate nominating at least one additional wholly-owned discovery program in 2019.\nIn addition, we entered into collaborations with F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann La Roche Inc., which we collectively refer to as Roche, and CStone in March 2016 and June 2018, respectively. Under our collaboration agreement with Roche, we are seeking to discover, develop and commercialize up to five small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy, as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics. Under our collaboration agreement with CStone, we are seeking to develop and commercialize BLU-554, avapritinib and BLU-667, including back-up forms and certain other forms, in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the CStone territory, either as a monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy. We will continue to evaluate additional collaborations that could maximize the value for our programs and allow us to leverage the expertise of strategic collaborators. We are also focused on engaging in collaborations to capitalize on our discovery platform outside of our primary strategic focus area of cancer.\nWe currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to avapritinib, BLU-667 and BLU-554 other than the rights licensed to CStone in the CStone territory. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to BLU-782 and all of our discovery programs other than the discovery-stage programs under the Roche collaboration.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations and a debt financing. Through December 31, 2018, we have received an aggregate of $1.1 billion from such transactions, including $887.4 million in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our May 2015 initial public offering, or IPO, and December 2016, April 2017 and December 2017 follow-on public offerings, $115.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $18.8 million of upfront and milestone payments under our former collaboration with Alexion Pharma Holding, or Alexion, $55.0 million in upfront and milestone payments under our existing collaboration with Roche, a $40.0 million upfront payment under our existing collaboration with CStone, and $10.0 million in gross proceeds from the debt financing.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $236.6 million, $148.1 million and $72.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $597.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we:\n \u00b7 continue to advance and initiate clinical development activities for our lead drug candidate, avapritinib, as well as our other most advanced drug candidates, BLU-667, BLU-554 and BLU-782; \n \u00b7 seek marketing approvals for our drug candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u00b7 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval; \n \u00b7 continue to manufacture increasing quantities of drug substance and drug product material for use in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and for any potential commercialization; \n \u00b7 continue to discover, validate and develop additional drug candidates; \n \u00b7 conduct research and development activities under our collaborations with Roche and CStone; \n \u00b7 conduct development and commercialization activities for companion diagnostic tests for current or future drug candidates; \n \u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u00b7 acquire or in-license other drug candidates or technologies; \n \u00b7 hire additional research, clinical, quality, manufacturing, regulatory, commercial and general and administrative personnel; and \n \u00b7 incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. \nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from drug sales. Our revenue consists of collaboration revenue under our former collaboration with Alexion, which was terminated in October 2017, and our existing collaborations with Roche and CStone, including amounts that are recognized related to upfront payments, milestone payments and amounts due to us for research and development services. In the future, revenue may include revenues related to the supply of our drug candidates or products to CStone for development and commercialization activities in the CStone territory and additional milestone payments and royalties on any net product sales under our collaborations with Roche and CStone. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of avapritinib until 2020, assuming we are able to file for regulatory approval for avapritinib in the United States in the second quarter of 2019 and receive marketing approval by 2020. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of product sales, if any, license fees, research and development services and related reimbursements, payments for manufacturing services, and milestone and other payments.\nIn the future, subject to obtaining marketing approval for one or more of our drug candidates, we expect to generate revenue from a combination of product sales, royalties on product sales and cost reimbursements, as well as upfront, milestone and royalty payments, if any, under any current or future collaborations\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our drug candidates, which include:\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, pre-clinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of companion diagnostic tests; \n \u00b7 the cost of consultants; \n \u00b7 the cost associated with regulatory quality assurance and quality control operations; \n \u00b7 the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical study materials, clinical trial materials and commercial supply materials; and \n \u00b7 facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other operating costs in support of research and development activities. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nThe successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these drug candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u00b7 establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies; \n \u00b7 successful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials; \n \u00b7 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u00b7 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; \n \u00b7 obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates; \n \u00b7 commercializing the drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and \n \u00b7 continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our drug candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. In addition, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nA significant portion of our research and development expenses have been external expenses, which we track on a program-by-program basis following nomination as a development candidate. Our internal research and development expenses are primarily personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense. Except for internal research and development expenses related to collaboration agreements, we do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects under development.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Other development and pre-development candidate expenses, unallocated expenses and internal research and development expenses have been classified separately.\n\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with our clinical trials and preparing regulatory filings. These increases will likely include the costs related to the implementation and expansion of clinical trial sites and related patient enrollment, monitoring, program management and drug product and drug substance manufacturing expenses for current and future clinical trials. In addition, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we incur additional costs in connection with research and development activities under our collaboration with Roche, development activities under our collaboration with CStone and development activities for companion diagnostic tests for current and future drug candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, commercial, business development, information technology, legal and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, pre-commercial development activities, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and planned commercialization activities, including establishing a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, legal, auditing and filing fees and general compliance and consulting expenses, among other expenses. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company and expanding the scope of our operations.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of income earned on cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense on amounts outstanding under a loan and security agreement that we entered into with Silicon Valley Bank in May 2013 and amortization of debt discount. We made our final loan payment in 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding principal and interest under the loan and security agreement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are those policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses, available-for-sale investments and stock-based compensation.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we refer to as ASC 606, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. We only applied the modified retrospective transition method to contracts that were not completed as January 1, 2018, the effective date of adoption for ASC 606. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe enter into licensing agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which we may exclusively license rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above; (b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and (c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties and sales-based milestones, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nExclusive Licenses. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a promise or performance obligation is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nResearch and Development Services. The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by our employees on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts. Reimbursements from and payments to the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nCustomer Options. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options that are not determined to be material rights are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u2018\u2018Risk Factors'' section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results or timing of certain events could differ materially from the results or timing described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a precision therapy company focused on genomically defined cancers, rare diseases and cancer immunotherapy. Our approach is to leverage our novel target discovery engine to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases and to craft highly selective and potent drug candidates that may provide significant and durable clinical responses for patients without adequate treatment options. This integrated biology and chemistry approach enables us to identify, characterize and design drug candidates to inhibit novel kinase targets that have been difficult to selectively inhibit. We believe that our uniquely targeted, scalable approach empowers the rapid design and development of new treatments and increases the likelihood of success.\nOur most advanced drug candidates are avapritinib, BLU-667, BLU-554 and BLU-782. Our lead drug candidate, avapritinib, is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets KIT and PDGFRA mutations. These mutations abnormally activate receptor tyrosine kinases that are drivers of cancer and proliferative disorders, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, and systemic mastocytosis, or SM. GIST is a rare disease that is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the gastrointestinal tract, or GI tract, and SM is a rare disorder that causes an overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs, which can lead to a wide range of debilitating symptoms and organ dysfunction and failure. We are currently evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of GIST in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced GIST, which we refer to\nas our NAVIGATOR trial, and an ongoing global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial comparing avapritinib to regorafenib in third-line GIST, which we refer to as our VOYAGER trial. We have completed enrollment of the NAVIGATOR trial, and we plan to present additional data from this trial in the second quarter of 2019. We expect to complete enrollment of the VOYAGER trial in the second half of 2019. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 precision medicine trial in second-line GIST in the second half of 2019, which we refer to as our COMPASS-2L trial. In addition, we plan to submit a new drug application, or NDA, for avapritinib for the treatment of PDGFRA Exon 18 mutant GIST and fourth-line GIST in the second quarter of 2019, and we plan to submit a supplemental NDA for the treatment of third-line GIST in 2020. We are currently evaluating avapritinib for the treatment of SM in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our EXPLORER trial, an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced SM, which we refer to as our PATHFINDER trial, and an ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial in indolent and smoldering SM, which we refer to as our PIONEER trial. We plan to present updated data from the EXPLORER trial in advanced SM in the second quarter of 2019, and we plan to present initial data from the PIONEER trial in indolent and smoldering SM in the second half of 2019. We expect to complete enrollment of the PATHFINDER trial in the second half of 2019. We plan to submit an NDA for advanced SM in 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and the treatment of mastocytosis, and the European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and the treatment of mastocytosis. The FDA has granted fast track designation to avapritinib for (i) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST that progressed following treatment with imatinib and a second TKI and (ii) the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with the PDGFRA D842V mutation regardless of prior therapy. In addition, the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRA D842V mutation and to avapritinib for the treatment of advanced SM, including the subtypes of aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia.\nBLU-667 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is abnormally activated by mutations or fusions and RET resistance mutations that we predict will arise from treatment with first generation therapies. RET drives disease in subsets of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and cancers of the thyroid, including medullary thyroid carcinoma, or MTC, and papillary thyroid cancer, or PTC, and our research suggests that RET may drive disease in subsets of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer and other cancers. We are currently evaluating BLU-667 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with RET-altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors, which we refer to as our ARROW trial. We expect to complete enrollment of the previously treated NSCLC and MTC cohorts in the ARROW trial in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, we plan to present updated data from the ongoing ARROW trial in the second quarter of 2019. We plan to submit an NDA for BLU-667 in the first half of 2020 based on additional data from the ongoing ARROW trial and currently expect the NDA submission will be for separate potential indications: (1) patients with RET-fusion positive NSCLC who have progressed following prior systemic therapy and (2) patients with RET-mutant MTC who have progressed following treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. In addition, in the second half of 2019, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating BLU-667 in first-line RET-altered NSCLC and plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating BLU-667 in combination with osimertinib in treatment-resistant, EGFR-mutant NSCLC harboring an acquired RET alteration. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to BLU-667 for the treatment of RET-rearranged NSCLC, JAK1/2-positive NSCLC or TRKC-positive NSCLC, and the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to BLU-667 for the treatment of patients with RET mutation-positive MTC that requires systemic treatment and for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments.\nBLU-554 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets FGFR4, a kinase that is aberrantly activated in a defined subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, the most common type of liver cancer. We are currently evaluating BLU-554 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC. We and CStone Pharmaceuticals, or CStone, plan to expand our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of BLU-554 to include clinical sites in Mainland China by the middle of 2019. In addition, we and CStone plan to initiate a proof-of-concept clinical trial in the second half of 2019 in the CStone territory evaluating BLU-554 in combination with CS1001, a clinical stage anti-programmed death ligand-1 immunotherapy being developed by CStone, as a first-line therapy for the treatment of patients with HCC. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to BLU-554 for the treatment of HCC.\nBLU-782 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets mutant activin-like kinase 2, or ALK2. We are developing BLU-782 for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, a rare, severely disabling genetic disease caused by mutations in the ALK2 gene, ACVR1. FOP is characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification, which is the abnormal transformation of muscle, ligaments and tendons into bone. Heterotopic\nossification may be spontaneous or associated with painful episodic disease flare-ups that are usually precipitated by soft tissue injury. As the disease progresses, extra-skeletal bone increasingly restricts joints, resulting in severe disability and loss of mobility, compromised respiratory function and increased risk of early death. Currently, there are no approved therapies for FOP. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers in the first quarter of 2019, and we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating BLU-782 in patients with FOP in the first half of 2020. The FDA has granted fast track designation to BLU-782 for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.\nWe also plan to continue to leverage our discovery platform to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and craft drug candidates that potently and selectively target these kinases. We currently have four wholly-owned discovery programs for undisclosed kinase targets, and we anticipate nominating at least one additional wholly-owned discovery program in 2019.\nIn addition, we entered into collaborations with F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann La Roche Inc., which we collectively refer to as Roche, and CStone in March 2016 and June 2018, respectively. Under our collaboration agreement with Roche, we are seeking to discover, develop and commercialize up to five small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy, as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics. Under our collaboration agreement with CStone, we are seeking to develop and commercialize BLU-554, avapritinib and BLU-667, including back-up forms and certain other forms, in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the CStone territory, either as a monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy. We will continue to evaluate additional collaborations that could maximize the value for our programs and allow us to leverage the expertise of strategic collaborators. We are also focused on engaging in collaborations to capitalize on our discovery platform outside of our primary strategic focus area of cancer.\nWe currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to avapritinib, BLU-667 and BLU-554 other than the rights licensed to CStone in the CStone territory. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to BLU-782 and all of our discovery programs other than the discovery-stage programs under the Roche collaboration.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations and a debt financing. Through December 31, 2018, we have received an aggregate of $1.1 billion from such transactions, including $887.4 million in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common stock in our May 2015 initial public offering, or IPO, and December 2016, April 2017 and December 2017 follow-on public offerings, $115.1 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, $18.8 million of upfront and milestone payments under our former collaboration with Alexion Pharma Holding, or Alexion, $55.0 million in upfront and milestone payments under our existing collaboration with Roche, a $40.0 million upfront payment under our existing collaboration with CStone, and $10.0 million in gross proceeds from the debt financing.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $236.6 million, $148.1 million and $72.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $597.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we:\n \u00b7 continue to advance and initiate clinical development activities for our lead drug candidate, avapritinib, as well as our other most advanced drug candidates, BLU-667, BLU-554 and BLU-782; \n \u00b7 seek marketing approvals for our drug candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u00b7 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval; \n \u00b7 continue to manufacture increasing quantities of drug substance and drug product material for use in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and for any potential commercialization; \n \u00b7 continue to discover, validate and develop additional drug candidates; \n \u00b7 conduct research and development activities under our collaborations with Roche and CStone; \n \u00b7 conduct development and commercialization activities for companion diagnostic tests for current or future drug candidates; \n \u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u00b7 acquire or in-license other drug candidates or technologies; \n \u00b7 hire additional research, clinical, quality, manufacturing, regulatory, commercial and general and administrative personnel; and \n \u00b7 incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. \nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from drug sales. Our revenue consists of collaboration revenue under our former collaboration with Alexion, which was terminated in October 2017, and our existing collaborations with Roche and CStone, including amounts that are recognized related to upfront payments, milestone payments and amounts due to us for research and development services. In the future, revenue may include revenues related to the supply of our drug candidates or products to CStone for development and commercialization activities in the CStone territory and additional milestone payments and royalties on any net product sales under our collaborations with Roche and CStone. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of avapritinib until 2020, assuming we are able to file for regulatory approval for avapritinib in the United States in the second quarter of 2019 and receive marketing approval by 2020. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of product sales, if any, license fees, research and development services and related reimbursements, payments for manufacturing services, and milestone and other payments.\nIn the future, subject to obtaining marketing approval for one or more of our drug candidates, we expect to generate revenue from a combination of product sales, royalties on product sales and cost reimbursements, as well as upfront, milestone and royalty payments, if any, under any current or future collaborations\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our drug candidates, which include:\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties that conduct research and development, pre-clinical activities, clinical activities and manufacturing on our behalf; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of companion diagnostic tests; \n \u00b7 the cost of consultants; \n \u00b7 the cost associated with regulatory quality assurance and quality control operations; \n \u00b7 the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical study materials, clinical trial materials and commercial supply materials; and \n \u00b7 facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other operating costs in support of research and development activities. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nThe successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these drug candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u00b7 establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies; \n \u00b7 successful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials; \n \u00b7 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u00b7 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; \n \u00b7 obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates; \n \u00b7 commercializing the drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and \n \u00b7 continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our drug candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. In addition, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nA significant portion of our research and development expenses have been external expenses, which we track on a program-by-program basis following nomination as a development candidate. Our internal research and development expenses are primarily personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense. Except for internal research and development expenses related to collaboration agreements, we do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they are deployed across multiple projects under development.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Other development and pre-development candidate expenses, unallocated expenses and internal research and development expenses have been classified separately.\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAvapritinib external expenses\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n83,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n46,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBLU-554 external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBLU-667 external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBLU-782 external expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther development and pre-development candidate expenses and unallocated expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n49,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n243,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with our clinical trials and preparing regulatory filings. These increases will likely include the costs related to the implementation and expansion of clinical trial sites and related patient enrollment, monitoring, program management and drug product and drug substance manufacturing expenses for current and future clinical trials. In addition, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we incur additional costs in connection with research and development activities under our collaboration with Roche, development activities under our collaboration with CStone and development activities for companion diagnostic tests for current and future drug candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, commercial, business development, information technology, legal and human resources functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, pre-commercial development activities, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and planned commercialization activities, including establishing a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, legal, auditing and filing fees and general compliance and consulting expenses, among other expenses. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company and expanding the scope of our operations.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of income earned on cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense on amounts outstanding under a loan and security agreement that we entered into with Silicon Valley Bank in May 2013 and amortization of debt discount. We made our final loan payment in 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding principal and interest under the loan and security agreement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are those policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses, available-for-sale investments and stock-based compensation.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we refer to as ASC 606, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. We only applied the modified retrospective transition method to contracts that were not completed as January 1, 2018, the effective date of adoption for ASC 606. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe enter into licensing agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which we may exclusively license rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under our agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above; (b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and (c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties and sales-based milestones, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.\nExclusive Licenses. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a promise or performance obligation is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promise, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promise, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promise, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promise. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.\nResearch and Development Services. The promises under our collaboration agreements may include research and development services to be performed by our employees on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because we are the principal for such efforts. Reimbursements from and payments to the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nCustomer Options. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options that are not determined to be material rights are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized"}
