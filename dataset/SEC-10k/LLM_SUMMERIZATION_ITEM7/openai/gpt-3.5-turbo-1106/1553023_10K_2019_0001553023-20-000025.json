MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Form 10-K\"). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, statements regarding the industry outlook, our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non-historical statements contained herein are forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d You should also review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K reflect the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of CyrusOne for all periods presented.\nOverview\nOur Company. We are a fully integrated, self-managed data center real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") that owns, operates and develops enterprise-class, carrier-neutral, multi-tenant and single-tenant data center properties. Our data centers are generally purpose-built facilities with redundant power and cooling. They are not network specific and enable customer connectivity to a range of telecommunication carriers. We provide mission-critical data center facilities that protect and ensure the continued operation of information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure for approximately 1,000 customers in 49 data centers, including two recovery centers in 13 markets (10 cities in the U.S., London, U.K., Singapore and Frankfurt, Germany).\nOur Portfolio\nWe own and operate 49 data centers, including two recovery centers totaling 7.1 million Net Rentable Square Feet (\"NRSF\"), of which 85% of the Colocation Square Feet (\"CSF\") is leased and has 797 megawatts (\"MW\") of power capacity. This includes 13 buildings where the Company leases such facilities. We are lessee of approximately 13% of our total operating NRSF as of December 31, 2019. Also included in our total NRSF, CSF and MW are pre-stabilized assets (which include data halls that have been in service for less than 24 months and are less than 85% leased) that have approximately 315,125 NRSF and 28% of the CSF is leased with capacity of 30 MW of power.\nIn addition, we have properties under development comprising approximately 1.7 million NRSF and 92 MW of power capacity. The estimated remaining total costs to develop these properties is estimated to be a range between $544.0 million and $634.0 million. The final costs to develop could change depending on the capital improvements required based on the lease contracts executed on such properties. We also have 499 acres of land available for future data center development.\nIn 2018, we expanded our data center operations through the acquisition of data centers, buildings under development and land for future development in Europe including London, United Kingdom, Frankfurt, Germany, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Dublin, the Republic of Ireland. Through our acquisition of Zenium, we established a team, primarily based in London, U.K., to oversee and manage our European activities.\nOperational Overview\nThe following discussion provides an overview of the Company's capital and financing activity, operations and transactions for the year ended December 31, 2019 and should be read in conjunction with the full discussion of the Company's operating results, liquidity and capital resources included in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A.\nOutlook\nWe seek to maximize long-term earnings growth and shareholder value primarily through increasing cash flow at existing properties and developing high-quality data center assets and campuses at attractive cash yields with long-term, stable operating income. In addition, the Company will, from time to time, acquire existing properties which meet our strategic criteria, offer in-place cash flow and have strong growth prospects.\nFundamentals for data center real estate remain strong, supported by trends that particularly favor data center assets, including the exponential growth in global data, the growth of e-commerce and demand for outsourcing of data storage and cloud-based applications. Growth in large cloud-based demand has moderated in the U.S. in 2019 due to what we believe has been increased supply in major U.S. markets and following very strong absorption in 2018. We anticipate continued general economic growth in\nthe U.S. markets and strong demand in Europe in 2020, which we expect to result in ongoing positive demand for data center space in the markets we operate as companies expand and upgrade information system platforms.\nNew data center development, including speculative development, is present in most domestic and international metropolitan markets in response to strong tenant demand. However, construction remains rational in relation to net absorption in most markets. We expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for market demand for data center real estate.\nIn terms of capital investment, we will continue to pursue selective development of new buildings and the opportunistic acquisition of buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns.\nWe may, from time to time, selectively dispose of non-strategic assets in an effort to enhance long-term growth in earnings and cash flows, as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio and to recycle capital.\nWe anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our capital and operating expenses, including costs to maintain our properties and distributions, though we may finance investments, including acquisitions and developments, with the issuance of new shares of our common stock, proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional discussion.\nInflation\nThe U.S. economy has experienced low inflation over the last several years, as a result, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. Our customer leases generally do not provide for annual increases in rent based on inflation. As a result, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of operating and maintaining our data center facilities. Some of our leases have annual rent escalators, typically ranging from 1-3%; as a result we bear the risk of increases in operating costs. Some of our leases are structured to pass-through the cost of sub-metered utilities. In the future, we expect more of our leases to pass-through utility costs. In addition, approximately 70% of our leases expire within six years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at then existing rates.\nSummary of Significant Transactions and Activities for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nReal Estate Acquisitions, Development and Other Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we had cash capital expenditures of $876.4 million, of which $866.5 million related to the construction of data centers. The expansion and development of additional power capacity and building square feet contributed to our year-over-year revenue increase in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining cost to our existing development pipeline is $544.0 million to $634.0 million and are expected to add 92 MWs and 379,902 CSF. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired 74 acres of land in Dublin, the Republic of Ireland, San Antonio, Texas, Santa Clara, California, and Council Bluffs, Iowa for future development for $54.7 million.\nCapital and Financing Activity\nOn December 5, 2019, the Operating Partnership and CyrusOne Finance Corp., a single-purpose finance subsidiary, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (together, the \"Issuers\") completed a public offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% senior notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\") and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.450% senior notes due 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\"). The Company received proceeds of $1,197.4 million, net of underwriting costs and other deferred financing costs. The Company used the proceeds to finance the repurchase of all of its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \"Old 2024 Notes\") and all of its 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 (the \"Old 2027 Notes\" and together with the Old 2024 Notes, the \"Existing Notes\"), including the payment of consent payments, for the redemption and discharge of Existing Notes that remained outstanding after the completion of the tender offers and consent solicitations, for the payment of related premiums, fees, discounts and expenses and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the repurchase of the Existing Notes, the Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $71.8 million.\nIn August 2019, the Company entered into $500.0 million of cross-currency swaps that mature in March 2023 whereby the Company pays floating interest rate and receives floating interest rate to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1-month USD LIBOR versus EUR LIBOR rates (a pay-floating, receive-floating interest rate swap). In addition, in September 2019 the Company entered into a $300.0 million interest rate swap to hedge variable rate exposure to 1-month LIBOR to a fixed rate of 1.185%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold approximately 6.5 million shares of its common stock under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program. The sales generated net proceeds of approximately $355.6 million, net of sales commissions, underwriting discounts and estimated expenses of $4.3 million. As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $290.1 million in remaining capacity of the $750.0 million authorized under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program (as defined in Item 7 under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\").\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, CyrusOne Inc. entered into a forward sale agreement with a financial institution acting as forward purchaser under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program with respect to 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward price of $61.67 per share. The Company has twelve months to settle the forward sale agreement. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of its common shares by the forward purchasers. The Company currently expects to fully physically settle the forward equity sale agreement and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates at the Company's discretion, prior to the final settlement dates under the forward equity sale agreement in November 2020, in which case we expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares specified in such forward equity sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of the agreement will be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchasers' stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends during the term of the agreement. We have not settled any portion of this forward equity sale agreement as of the date of this filing.\nConcentration of revenue\nWe define our annualized backlog as the twelve-month recurring revenue (calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\")) for executed lease contracts achieved upon full occupancy which have not commenced as of the end of a period. Our backlog as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $51.7 million and approximately $54.0 million, respectively. During 2019, one customer represented 21% of our revenue. We expect these backlog lease contracts to primarily commence through the first half of 2020. Because GAAP revenue for any period is generally a function of straight line revenue recognized from lease contracts in existence at the beginning of a period, as well as lease contract renewals and new customer lease contracts commencing during the period, backlog as of any period is not necessarily indicative of near-term performance. Our definition of backlog may differ from other companies in our industry.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are based on historical experiences that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. From time to time we re-evaluate those estimates and assumptions. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of the financial statements.\nOur actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue consists of lease revenue and revenue from contracts with customers. The revenues from colocation rent revenue, metered power reimbursements and interconnection revenue are recognized under the lease accounting standard and revenues from managed services, equipment sales, installations and other services (generally revenue from contracts with customers) are recognized under the revenue accounting standard. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized when the collection of rent receivables is deemed to be unlikely. We adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d), the new accounting standard for leases, effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and prior periods were not restated. In addition, we adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d), the new accounting standard for revenue from contracts with customers, effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. See Note 4, Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Note 5, Revenue Recognition and Note 6, Leases - As a Lessee, in our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information related to the adoption.\nLease Revenue\nOur leasing revenue primarily consists of colocation rent, metered power reimbursements and interconnection revenue and is accounted for under ASC 842, Leases. We generally are not entitled to reimbursements for rental expenses including real estate taxes, insurance or other common area operating expenses. The accounting for leases is highly dependent on the classification of the lease as an operating or finance lease and requires judgment and estimates in evaluating the principles of the new accounting standard for leases, including whether an arrangement is a lease, the fair value of the identified asset, expected lease term and economic life of the asset.\nColocation Rent Revenue\nColocation rent revenues, including interconnection revenue, are fixed minimum lease payments generally billed monthly in advance based on the contracted power or leased space. Some contracts may provide initial free rent periods and rents that escalate over the term of the contract. If rents escalate without the lessee gaining access to or control over additional leased power or space at the beginning of the lease term, the rental payments are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. If rents escalate because the lessee gains access to and control over additional power and or leased space, revenue is recognized in proportion to the additional power or space in the periods that the lessee has control over the use of the additional power or space. The excess of revenue recognized over amounts contractually due is recognized as a straight-line receivable, which is included in rent and other receivables in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Some of our leases are structured on a gross basis in which the customer pays a fixed amount for colocation space and power. The revenue for these types of leases is recorded in colocation rent revenue.\nMetered Power Reimbursements Revenue\nSome of our leases provide that the customer is separately billed for power based upon actual or estimated metered usage at rates then in effect. Metered power reimbursement revenue is variable lease payments generally billed one month in arrears, and an estimate of this revenue is accrued in the month that the associated power is provided and recorded in metered power reimbursements revenue.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nManaged services, equipment sales, installations and other services are recognized under ASC 606.\nEquipment sold by us generally consists of servers, switches, networking equipment, cable infrastructure and cabinets. Revenue is recognized at a point-in-time when control of the equipment transfers to the customer from the Company, which generally occurs upon delivery to the customer.\nManaged services include providing a full-service managed data center, monitoring customer computer equipment, managing backups and storage, utilization reporting and other related ancillary information technology services. Management service contracts generally range from one to five years.\nInstallation services include mounting, wiring, and testing of customer owned equipment. The installation period is typically short term in duration, and accordingly, revenue from the installation of customer equipment is recognized at a point-in-time once the installation is complete and the performance obligation is satisfied. Other services generally include installation of customer equipment, performing customer system re-boots, server cabinet and cage management, power monitoring, shipping and receiving, resolving technical issues, and other services requested by the customer. Other service revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract and recognized over time as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nAcquisition of Properties\nInvestment in real estate consist of land, buildings, improvements and integral equipment utilized in our data center operations. We expect most acquisitions to be asset acquisitions rather than a business combination as our typical acquisitions consist of properties whereby substantially all the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset set (land, building and in-place leases), which are treated as asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are recorded at the cumulative acquisition costs and allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of identifiable tangible assets such as land, building, building and land improvements, and tenant improvements is determined on an as-if-vacant\u201d basis. In estimating the fair value of each component acquired, management uses its judgment and estimates, considers appraisals, replacement cost, its own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties, market rental data and other related information.\nCapitalization of Costs\nWe capitalize costs directly related to the development, pre-development or improvement of our investment in real estate, referred to as capital projects and other activities included within this paragraph. Costs associated with our capital projects are capitalized as incurred. If the project is abandoned, these costs are expensed during the period in which the project is abandoned. The accounting for capitalization of costs requires judgment and estimates to evaluate each project, including the timing and activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, evaluation of direct and indirect project costs, and the allocation of costs to specific projects. Costs considered for capitalization include, but are not limited to, construction costs, interest, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, if appropriate. We capitalize indirect costs such as personnel, office and administrative expenses that are directly related to our development projects based on an estimate of the time spent on the construction and development activities. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. We determine when the capitalization period begins and ends through communication with project and other managers responsible for the tracking and oversight of individual projects. In the event that the activities to ready the asset for its intended use are suspended, the capitalization period will cease until such activities are resumed. In addition, we capitalize incremental initial direct costs incurred for successful origination of new leases which include internal and external leasing commissions. Interest expense is capitalized based on actual qualifying capital expenditures from the period when development commences until the asset is ready for its intended use, at the weighted average borrowing rate during the period. These costs are included in investment in real estate and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related assets.\nCosts incurred for maintaining and repairing our properties, which do not extend their useful lives, are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment\nManagement reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset (or group of assets) and proceeds from its eventual disposition and compare such amount to its carrying amount. To determine the cash flows we consider factors such as future operating income, leasing demand, rental rates, competition and other factors. The estimate of expected future cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies to a considerable extent on management estimates and assumptions, including current and future market conditions, projected growth in our CSF, projected recurring rent churn (as described below), lease renewal rates and our ability to generate new leases on favorable terms. If our undiscounted net cash flows indicate that we are unable to recover the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The evaluation whether assets may not be recoverable and the estimates and assumptions used to determine undiscounted cash flows and fair value requires significant judgment by management.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an impairment loss of $0.7 million, primarily due to an impairment loss on the South Bend-Monroe facility, which is being actively marketed to sell. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized no impairment losses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized impairment losses of $58.0 million which included the impairment loss of $54.4 million for our leased data center facilities in the Connecticut markets and $3.6 million related to our leased facility in Singapore, which are included in impairment losses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nKey Operating Metrics\nAnnualized Rent. We calculate annualized rent as monthly contractual rent (defined as cash rent including customer reimbursements for metered power) under existing customer leases as of December 31, 2019, multiplied by 12. Monthly contractual rent is primarily for data center space, power and connectivity; however, it includes rent for office space and other ancillary services. For the month of December 2019, customer reimbursements were $137.6 million annualized and consisted of reimbursements by customers across all facilities with separately metered power. Other companies may not define annualized rent in the same manner. Accordingly, our annualized rent may not be comparable to others. Management believes annualized rent provides a useful measure of our in-place lease revenue.\nColocation Square Feet (\"CSF\"). We calculate leased total CSF as the NRSF at an operating facility that is leased or readily available for lease as colocation space, where customers locate their servers and other IT equipment.\nLeased Rate. We calculate leased rate by dividing leased total CSF by total CSF. Percent occupied differs from Percent leased. Percent occupied is determined based on occupied CSF billed to customers under signed leases divided by total CSF. Leases signed but that have not commenced are not included.\nRecurring Rent Churn Percentage. We calculate recurring rent churn percentage as any reduction in recurring rent due to customer terminations, service reductions or net pricing decreases as a percentage of rent at the beginning of the period, excluding any impact from metered power reimbursements or other usage-based billing.\nCapital Expenditures. Expenditures that expand, improve or extend the life of real estate and non-real estate property are capital expenditures. Management views its capital expenditures as comprised of acquisitions of real estate, development of real estate, recurring real estate expenditures and all other non-real estate capital expenditures. Purchases of land or buildings from third parties represent acquisitions of real estate. Capital spending that expands or improves our data centers is deemed development of real estate. Replacements of data center equipment are considered recurring real estate expenditures. Purchases of software, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures are included in non-real estate capital expenditures.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nRental Income. Our revenue growth depends on our ability to maintain our existing revenue base and to sell new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development activities. As of December 31, 2019, we have leased approximately 85% of our CSF. Our ability to grow revenue with our existing customers will also be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. We believe the current rates charged to our customers generally reflect appropriate market rates. This is consistent with our relatively flat historical re-leasing spreads. As such, we do not anticipate significant rate increases or decreases in the aggregate as contracts renew. However, negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods. Future economic downturns, regional downturns affecting our markets, or oversupply of or decrease in demand for data center colocation services could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers' leases on favorable terms, and this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase revenues.\nLeasing Arrangements. As of December 31, 2019, 18% of our leased NRSF was to customers on a gross basis. Under a gross lease, the customer pays a fixed monthly rent amount, and we are responsible for all data center facility electricity, maintenance and repair costs, property taxes, insurance and other utilities associated with that customer's space. For leases under this model, fluctuations in our customers' monthly utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us impact our profitability. As of December 31, 2019, 82% of our leased NRSF was to customers with separately billed metered power. Under the metered power model, the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount, plus its actual costs of sub-metered electricity used to power its data center equipment, plus an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center, expressed as a factor of the customer's actual electricity usage. We are responsible for all other costs listed in the description of the gross lease above. Fluctuations in a customer's utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not impact our profitability under the metered power model. In future periods, we expect more of our contracts to be structured to bill power on a metered power basis.\nGrowth and Expansion Activities. Our ability to grow our revenue and profitability will depend on our ability to acquire and develop data center space globally at an appropriate cost and to lease the data center space to customers on favorable terms. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased our operational NRSF by 6.1%, bringing our total operating NRSF to approximately 7.1 million at December 31, 2019. Our portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, also included approximately 1.7 million NRSF under development, as well as 1.9 million NRSF of additional powered shell space under roof available for development. In addition, we have approximately 499 acres of land that are available for future data center shell development. We expect that the eventual construction of this future development space will enable us to accommodate a portion of the future demand of our existing and future customers and increase our future revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nScheduled Lease Expirations. Our ability to maintain low recurring rent churn and renew expiring customer leases on favorable terms will impact our results of operations. Our data center uncommitted capacity as of December 31, 2019, was approximately 1.7 million NRSF. Excluding month-to-month leases, leases representing 11% and 9% of our total NRSF are scheduled to expire in 2020 and 2021, respectively. These leases represented approximately 15% and 16% of our total annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. Month-to-month leases represented 3% of our total annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. Recurring rent churn was 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our recurring rent churn for each quarter in 2019 ranged from 0.6% to 2.1%, in comparison to a range of 0.5% to 2.6% in 2018.\nConditions in Significant Markets. Our properties are located in 13 distinct markets (10 cities in the U.S., plus London, U.K., Singapore and Frankfurt, Germany). Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, New York Metro, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and San Antonio accounted for approximately 83% of our annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. We have recently expanded into development in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Dublin, the Republic of Ireland. General economic conditions and regulations in these markets could impact our overall profitability.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nTable 117:

customers (not including customers that have signed leases but have not begun occupying space), many of which have signed leases for multiple sites and multiple services, amenities and/or features. We generate recurring revenues from leasing colocation space and nonrecurring revenues from equipment sales and installation services. We provide customers with data center services pursuant to leases with initial terms ranging from three to ten years. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining term was 4.3 years based upon annualized rent. Lease expirations through 2022, excluding month-to-month leases, represent 28% of our total NRSF, or 42% of our aggregate annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. At the end of the lease term, customers may allow the contract to expire, sign a new lease or automatically renew pursuant to the terms of their lease. The automatic renewal period could be for varying lengths, depending on the terms of the contract, such as, for the original lease term, one year or month-to-month. As of December 31, 2019, 1% of our NRSF was subject to month-to-month leases.\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue was $981.3 million, an increase of $159.9 million, or 19.5% compared to $821.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Recurring rent churn of 4.9%, excluding a 0.4% impact related to a customer that terminated in 2016, for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 0.1% as compared to 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe revenue increase of $159.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to the following:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$125.4 million increase in colocation rent primarily due to increases from existing and new customers, including a $36.1 million increase due to the acquisition of Zenium in August 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$29.9 million decrease in colocation rent primarily due to rent churn in Houston, Dallas, Cincinnati and New York;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$34.8 million increase in metered power reimbursements primarily due to a $37.9 million increase from existing and new customers, including a $14.2 million increase due to the acquisition of Zenium in August 2018, offset in part by $3.1 million of rent churn;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$14.4 million increase in equipment sales and installation services primarily due to one significant customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$7.1 million increase in termination fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$6.3 million increase in interconnection revenue;

See Note 9, Equity Investments, related to our sale of a portion of our equity investment in GDS.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, loss on early extinguishment of debt was $71.8 million, primarily due to the Company's repayment of the $1.2 billion aggregate outstanding principal balance of existing senior notes upon the completion of a new senior notes offering in December 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, loss on early extinguishment of debt was $3.1 million, primarily due to the Company's repayment of the $900.0 million aggregate outstanding principal balance of its previous credit facility upon entering into a new senior unsecured credit agreement in March 2018.\nForeign currency and derivative losses, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Foreign currency and derivative losses, net were $7.5 million which was the result of a decrease in the fair value of the portion of our Euro/USD cross-currency swap that were not designated as hedges and changes in the fair value were immediately recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2019, we have $290.9 million notional Euro/USD cross-currency swaps contracts for \u20ac261.1 million not designated and changes in the forward USD/Euro spot exchange rate will impact the fair value of these swaps. If the US dollar weakens versus the Euro, the fair value of the swap liability may increase and since these hedges are not designated, we may incur losses that would be immediately recognized in earnings.\nImpairment loss on real estate\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, impairment loss on real estate was $0.7 million, primarily due to an impairment loss on the South Bend - Monroe

increase of $149.4 million, or 22%, compared to $672.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Fluctuations in revenue are dependent upon our ability to maintain our existing\nrevenue base, sell new capacity, and maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. Rent churn of 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 1.1% as compared to the 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Colocation square feet increased 17% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Leased CSF as of December 31, 2018 was 88%, a 5% increase as compared to 83% as of December 31, 2017. The occupancy percentage increase is primarily related to data centers in the lease-up stage that moved into stabilized properties (which include data halls that have been in service for at least 24 months or are at least 85% leased) during the year ended December 31, 2018. The properties are located in Austin, Houston, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and San Antonio.\nThe revenue increase of $149.4 million in 2018, as compared to 2017 is primarily due to the following:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$144.2 million increase in revenue from existing and new customers including $96.9 million in colocation rent revenue, $28.3 million in metered power rent reimbursements and $6.8 million in interconnection revenue,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$27.7 million increase as a result of the timing of acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, as we benefited in 2018 from a full year of revenue related to the acquisition of two data centers completed in February 2017 and the acquisition of Zenium which closed in August 2018 (see Note 7, Acquisitions and Purchases of Fixed Assets, for further information regarding acquisitions), and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>offset in part by a $23.1 million decrease as a result of the increase of 1.1 percent in churn.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, property operating expenses were $292.4 million, an increase of $57.3 million, or 24%, compared to $235.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the following:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$9.9 million increase in property operating expenses as a result of the timing of acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the Sentinel acquisition completed in February 2017 and the acquisition of Zenium which closed in August 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$41.8 million increase primarily due to electricity, repairs and maintenance, and security primarily due to our increased NRSF, higher utility rates, and power usage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$2.6 million increase in equipment cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$5.7 million increase in personnel, property taxes and other operating expenses, primarily related to personnel supporting our additional CSF deployed and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>offset in part by a $2.7 million decrease in rental expense due to the expiration of two leased facilities in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, sales and marketing expenses were $19.6 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 15%, compared to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to transition costs of $1.6 million related to increases in sales relocation costs for our new Seattle office and payroll-related costs of $0.8 million.\nGeneral and administrative\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, general and administrative expenses were $80.6 million, an increase of $13.6 million, or 20%, compared to $67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the following:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$2.9 million increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of the acquisitions of Sentinel and Zenium discussed previously,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$10.7 million increase in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increases of $6.0 million in personnel expenses and $2.3 million in legal and professional fees associated with implementing new accounting standards, new European privacy regulatory compliance and related system implementation costs, IT license support and legal fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, depreciation and amortization expense was $334.1 million, an increase of $75.2 million, or 29%, compared to $258.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The acquisition of Sentinel and Zenium resulted in an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The remaining increase was primarily driven by assets that were placed in service in 2018. Since December 31, 2017, approximately $829.7 million of new data center assets have been placed in service. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to increase in future periods as we acquire and develop new properties and expand our existing data center facilities.\nTransaction, acquisition, integration and other related expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred costs of $5.0 million primarily related to diligence efforts on certain targeted acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred costs of $11.9 million primarily related to diligence efforts on certain targeted acquisitions and costs incurred for integration of acquisitions.\nImpairment losses\nThere were no impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized impairments of $58.0 million which includes the impairment loss of $54.4 million for our leased data center facilities in the Connecticut markets and $3.6 million related to our leased facility in Singapore.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nInterest expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, interest expense was $94.7 million, an increase of $26.6 million, or 39%, as compared to $68.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in our capitalized interest from the year ended December 31, 2017 of $7.4 million due to increased development activity. The gross increase in interest expense was primarily a result of the increase in the average principal balances of senior notes outstanding of $800.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, versus $1.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018. We anticipate drawing on our $1.7 Billion Revolving Credit Facility to fund, in part, capital investments in data centers, including acquisitions. Accordingly, we anticipate our interest expense to increase in future periods.\nUnrealized gain on marketable equity investment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the unrealized gain on our marketable equity investment in GDS was $9.9 million, primarily as a result of an appreciation in GDS's share price since December 31, 2017.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, loss on early extinguishment of debt was $3.1 million, primarily due to the Company's entering into the $3.0 Billion Credit Facility and fully retiring the then-existing facility. For the year ended December 31, 2017, loss on early extinguishment of debt was $36.5 million, primarily due to costs associated with the repurchase of the $474.8 million in aggregate face value of our 2022 Notes ($525.0 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\")).\nIncome tax expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, income tax expense was $0.6 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily related to deferred tax benefits associated with our assets acquired in the Zenium acquisition.\nSignificant Balance Sheet Fluctuations\nThe table below relates to significant fluctuations in certain line items of our Consolidated Balance Sheets from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 (in millions):\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>Difference\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment in real estate, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,710.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,293.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity investments\n</td> <td>135.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, net\n</td> <td>161.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1.7 Billion Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>615.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loans\n</td> <td>1,100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(200.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease liabilities\n</td> <td>31.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(124.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease liabilities\n</td> <td>195.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax liability\n</td> <td>60.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional paid in capital\n</td> <td>3,202.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,837.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>364.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in total investment in real estate, net was primarily due to the continued development of data centers in Amsterdam, Austin, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Northern Virginia, Phoenix, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio and Santa Clara, less depreciation expense of $364.4 million. Land purchases for future development were made in Dublin, San Antonio, Santa Clara and Council Bluffs.\nThe decrease in equity investments was primarily due to the sale of 5.7 million GDS ADSs in April 2019. We continue to hold approximately 2.3 million GDS ADSs. This equity investment had a fair value of $118.7 million as of December 31, 2019. We did not receive any distributions related to our equity investment during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nThe increase in operating lease ROU assets is due to the new accounting standard for leases. For more information, see Note 4, Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Note 6, Leases - As a Lessee.\nThe increase in borrowing under the $1.7 Billion Revolving Credit Facility was primarily due to borrowing under the U.S. and EUR revolvers to fund development and operations.\nThe decrease in the term loans was primarily due the repayment of $200.0 million of the 2023 Term Loan using the proceeds of the sale of GDS ADSs.\nThe decrease in finance lease liabilities and the increase in operating lease liabilities are due to the new accounting standard for leases. For more information, see Note 4, Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Note 6, Leases - As a Lessee.\nThe decrease in deferred tax liability is primarily related to the decrease in deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of Zenium in August 2018. For more information, see Note 19, Income Taxes.\nThe increase in additional paid in capital was primarily due to proceeds from sales of the Company's common stock pursuant to the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, capital expenditures were $876.4 million primarily related to the acquisition of land for future development and continued development in key markets, primarily in Amsterdam, Austin, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and Raleigh-Durham. Included in capital expenditures are land purchases of $54.7 million in Santa Clara, San Antonio, Dublin and Council Bluffs for future development. We also made a capital contribution of approximately $3.8 million to our investment in ODATA Brasil S.A. and ODATA Colombia S.A.S (collectively \"ODATA\").\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, capital expenditures were $1,328.5 million. Our capital expenditures for 2018 included the acquisition of Zenium for $462.8 million. In addition, 2018 capital expenditures included $865.7 million related primarily to the continued development in key markets, primarily Chicago, Dallas, Northern Virginia and Somerset. We also made an equity investment in ODATA for $12.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, capital expenditures were $1,406.8 million, including the purchase price of the Sentinel Properties on February 28, 2017 for $492.3 million. Other capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 related primarily to development projects underway in Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and San Antonio; and the purchase of land parcels in Allen, Texas, Atlanta, Georgia and Quincy, Washington for future development for approximately $20.2 million.\nKey Performance Indicators - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures related to our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as being more important than, or a substitute for, comparable GAAP financial measures. In compliance with SEC requirements, our non-GAAP financial measures presented herein are reconciled to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Neither the SEC nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on these non-GAAP measurements.\nFunds from Operations and Normalized Funds from Operations\nWe use funds from operations (\"FFO\") and normalized funds from operations (\"Normalized FFO\"), which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry, as supplemental performance measures. We use FFO and Normalized FFO as supplemental performance measures because, when compared period over period, they capture trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs, FFO and Normalized FFO are used by investors as a basis to evaluate REITs.\nWe calculate FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP before real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment losses and loss on disposal of assets. While it is consistent with the definition of FFO promulgated by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), our computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other REITs. Accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to others.\nWe calculate Normalized FFO as FFO plus loss on early extinguishment of debt; gain on marketable equity investment; foreign currency and derivative losses, net; new accounting standards and regulatory compliance and the related system implementation costs; amortization of tradenames; transaction, acquisition, integration and other related expenses; severance and management transition costs; legal claim costs and other items as appropriate. We believe our Normalized FFO calculation provides a comparable measure between different periods. Other REITs may not calculate Normalized FFO in the same manner. Accordingly, our Normalized FFO may not be comparable to others.\nIn addition, because FFO and Normalized FFO exclude real estate depreciation and amortization, and capture neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or from market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO and Normalized FFO as measures of our performance is limited. Therefore, FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered only as supplements to net income (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our performance. FFO and Normalized FFO should not be used as measures of our liquidity or as indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. FFO and Normalized FFO also should not be used as supplements to or substitutes for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted the new accounting standard with respect to leases, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6, Leases - As a Lessee, to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information. We have adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective transition method, where financial statement presentations prior to the date of adoption are not restated. Accordingly, all information related to periods prior to 2019 have not been adjusted, including non-GAAP measurements.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to FFO and Normalized FFO for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (amounts in millions):\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(83.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate depreciation and amortization(1)\n</td> <td>408.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>325.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses and loss on disposal of assets(1)\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from Operations (\"FFO\") - NAREIT defined\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>451.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>71.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on marketable equity investment\n</td> <td>(132.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency and derivative losses, net\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New accounting standards and regulatory compliance and the related system implementation costs\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of tradenames(1)\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction, acquisition, integration and other related expenses(1)\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and management transition costs\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal claim costs\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Normalized Funds from Operations (\"Normalized FFO\")\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>409.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Reflects certain reclassifications of previously reported amortization of customer intangibles and transaction costs to conform with the current presentation.\nNet Operating Income\nWe use Net Operating Income (\"NOI\"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the REIT industry, as a supplemental performance measure. We use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, when compared period over period, it captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating expenses. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, NOI is used by investors as a basis to evaluate REITs.\nWe calculate NOI as net income (loss), adjusted for sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, transaction, acquisition, integration and other related expenses, interest expense, net, gain on marketable equity investment, loss on early extinguishment of debt, impairment losses, foreign currency and derivative losses, net, other expense, income tax (benefit) expense and other items as appropriate. Amortization of deferred leasing costs is presented in depreciation and amortization expenses, which is excluded from NOI. Sales and marketing expenses are not property-specific, rather these expenses support our entire portfolio. As a result, we have excluded these sales and marketing expenses from our NOI calculation, consistent with the treatment of general and administrative expenses, which also support our entire portfolio. Because the calculation of NOI excludes various expenses, the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate NOI in the same manner. Accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to others. Therefore, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity or as indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. NOI also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(83.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>83.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expenses\n</td> <td>417.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction, acquisition, integration and other related expenses\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>82.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on marketable equity investment\n</td> <td>(132.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>71.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency and derivative losses, net\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Operating Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>597.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>529.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Material Terms of Our Indebtedness\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis in order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to common stockholders from cash flows from operating activities. All such distributions are at the discretion of our board of directors.\nWe have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to offer for sale unspecified amounts of various classes of equity and debt securities and warrants. As circumstances arise, we may issue debt, equity and/or warrants from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Board authorized us to enter into sales agreements pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell from time to time shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $750.0 million (the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program\u201d). The New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program replaced our prior at-the-market stock offering program. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program, generating net proceeds of approximately $355.6 million, net of sales commissions, underwriting discounts and estimated expenses of $4.3 million. As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $290.1 million under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program available for future offerings.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, CyrusOne Inc. entered into a forward sale agreement with a financial institution acting as forward purchaser under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program with respect to 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward price of $61.67 per share. The Company has twelve months to settle the forward sale agreement. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of its common shares by the forward purchasers. The Company currently expects to fully physically settle the forward equity sale agreement and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates at the Company's discretion, prior to the final settlement dates under the forward equity sale agreement in November 2020, in which case we expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares specified in such forward equity sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of the agreement will be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchasers' stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends during the term of the agreement. We have not settled any portion of this forward equity sale agreement as of the date of this filing.\nOur total common stock issuance for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $357.2 million which included $355.6 million under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program and $1.6 million related to employee stock purchases and stock options exercised.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total number of outstanding shares of common stock was approximately 114.8 million.\nShort-term Liquidity\nOur short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, dividend payments and recurring capital expenditures for our data center properties. We generally expect to meet these requirements from our cash flow from operations, cash balances and availability under our $1.7 Billion Revolving Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our cash provided by operating activities was $365.7 million. This was more than our dividend payment for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $210.4 million.\nAvailable capacity under the $3.0 Billion Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 was $1,076.8 million related to the $1.7 Billion Revolving Credit Facility. Total liquidity as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $1,153.2 million, which included the $1,076.8 million available revolver capacity and cash and cash equivalents of $76.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had borrowings of $615.0 million under the $1.7 Billion Revolving Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had borrowings of $143.0 million under the $1.7 Billion Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn January 2020, CyrusOne LP and CyrusOne Finance Corp. closed their previously announced offering of \u20ac500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.450% Senior Notes due 2027. See Note 23, Subsequent Event.\nLong-term Liquidity\nOur long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of our capital expenditures for the development and acquisition of our data centers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our cash capital expenditures were $876.4 million. Our capital expenditures are primarily discretionary, excluding leases under contract, and have been utilized to expand our existing data center properties, acquire or construct new facilities. We intend to continue to develop and expand properties and are prepared to commit additional resources to support this growth. We expect our total estimated capital expenditures for 2020 to be between $750.0 million and $850.0 million. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including potential acquisitions, from cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from our operations, issuances of debt and equity securities, and borrowings under our $1.7 Billion Revolving Credit Facility.\nWhile we regularly monitor commodity and labor pricing trends related to our data center development capital expenditures, a large proportion of our current development project costs are under firm price commitments. Accordingly, while we have experienced price increases in certain selective materials due to recent international trade negotiations and actions, we currently do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our overall development costs.\nAs of December 31, 2019, all of our outstanding debt matures from March 2023 to November 2029, with a weighted average of 5.2 years to maturity. We expect to refinance these debts at or before their maturities, or retire the debt from the sources described in this section. Our interest rate mix was 51% fixed and 49% floating.\nIn addition to the sources of capital described herein, we have access to other potential sources of capital including mortgage financing, property dispositions and proceeds from contributions and partial sale of properties into joint ventures.\nMaterial Terms of Our Indebtedness\nSee Note 12, Debt, for the material terms of our indebtedness under the $3.0 Billion Credit Facility and our 2024 Notes and 2029 Notes.\nCash Flows\nOur primary sources of cash during 2019 were earnings from our operations, net proceeds from our $3.0 Billion Credit Facility, and net proceeds from the issuances of common stock, 2024 Notes and 2029 Notes. Our primary uses of cash during 2019 were capital expenditures for the development of real estate, funding our operations and payment of dividends.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IN MILLIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(679.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,341.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,506.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>324.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,354.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $365.7 million compared to $309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Our capital expenditures for 2019 of $876.4 million primarily related to the acquisition of land for future development and continued development in key markets, primarily in Amsterdam, Austin, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and Raleigh-Durham. Included in capital expenditures are land purchases of $54.7 million in Santa Clara, San Antonio, Dublin, and Council Bluffs for future development. We also made a capital contribution of approximately $3.8 million to our ODATA investment. These investment outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $199.0 million from the sale of 5.7 million ADSs from our GDS investment and proceeds from the sale of real estate assets of $1.3 million. Our capital expenditures for 2018 included the acquisition of Zenium for $462.8 million.

Liabilities are established for these claims when losses associated with these matters are judged to be probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Based on information currently available, consultation with counsel and established reserves, management believes the outcome of all claims will not individually, nor in the aggregate, have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we were not involved in any material lawsuits that required us to recognize an expense.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIndemnification\nDuring the normal course of business, we make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include (i) intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sale and/or license of products and services, (ii) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on our negligence or willful misconduct and (iii) indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts. In addition, we have made contractual commitments to several employees providing for payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that we could be obligated to make.\nAlso as a part of our normal course of business we procure certain data center equipment (generally generators and power distribution units) and electricity power under purchase commitments, where we would be required to purchase certain minimum volumes. In general, we expect to manage these contracts such that the committed volume levels are below our current requirements and at prices that are below current spot market prices. However, if our requirements were to decrease or the spot market prices were to decrease, we could be obligated to complete the remaining minimum purchase commitments, holding the excess equipment for future development or disposing at then current prices.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, statements regarding the industry outlook, our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non-historical statements contained herein are forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d You should also review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K reflect the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of CyrusOne for all periods presented.\nOverview\nOur Company. We are a fully integrated, self-managed data center real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") that owns, operates and develops enterprise-class, carrier-neutral, multi-tenant and single-tenant data center properties. Our data centers are generally purpose-built facilities with redundant power and cooling. They are not network specific and enable customer connectivity to a range of telecommunication carriers. We provide mission-critical data center facilities that protect and ensure the continued operation of information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure for approximately 1,000 customers in 49 data centers, including two recovery centers in 13 markets (10 cities in the U.S., London, U.K., Singapore and Frankfurt, Germany).\nOur Portfolio\nWe own and operate 49 data centers, including two recovery centers totaling 7.1 million Net Rentable Square Feet (\"NRSF\"), of which 85% of the Colocation Square Feet (\"CSF\") is leased and has 797 megawatts (\"MW\") of power capacity. This includes 13 buildings where the Company leases such facilities. We are lessee of approximately 13% of our total operating NRSF as of December 31, 2019. Also included in our total NRSF, CSF and MW are pre-stabilized assets (which include data halls that have been in service for less than 24 months and are less than 85% leased) that have approximately 315,125 NRSF and 28% of the CSF is leased with capacity of 30 MW of power.\nIn addition, we have properties under development comprising approximately 1.7 million NRSF and 92 MW of power capacity. The estimated remaining total costs to develop these properties is estimated to be a range between $544.0 million and $634.0 million. The final costs to develop could change depending on the capital improvements required based on the lease contracts executed on such properties. We also have 499 acres of land available for future data center development.\nIn 2018, we expanded our data center operations through the acquisition of data centers, buildings under development and land for future development in Europe including London, United Kingdom, Frankfurt, Germany, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Dublin, the Republic of Ireland. Through our acquisition of Zenium, we established a team, primarily based in London, U.K., to oversee and manage our European activities.\nOperational Overview\nThe following discussion provides an overview of the Company's capital and financing activity, operations and transactions for the year ended December 31, 2019 and should be read in conjunction with the full discussion of the Company's operating results, liquidity and capital resources included in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A.\nOutlook\nWe seek to maximize long-term earnings growth and shareholder value primarily through increasing cash flow at existing properties and developing high-quality data center assets and campuses at attractive cash yields with long-term, stable operating income. In addition, the Company will, from time to time, acquire existing properties which meet our strategic criteria, offer in-place cash flow and have strong growth prospects.\nFundamentals for data center real estate remain strong, supported by trends that particularly favor data center assets, including the exponential growth in global data, the growth of e-commerce and demand for outsourcing of data storage and cloud-based applications. Growth in large cloud-based demand has moderated in the U.S. in 2019 due to what we believe has been increased supply in major U.S. markets and following very strong absorption in 2018. We anticipate continued general economic growth in\nthe U.S. markets and strong demand in Europe in 2020, which we expect to result in ongoing positive demand for data center space in the markets we operate as companies expand and upgrade information system platforms.\nNew data center development, including speculative development, is present in most domestic and international metropolitan markets in response to strong tenant demand. However, construction remains rational in relation to net absorption in most markets. We expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for market demand for data center real estate.\nIn terms of capital investment, we will continue to pursue selective development of new buildings and the opportunistic acquisition of buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns.\nWe may, from time to time, selectively dispose of non-strategic assets in an effort to enhance long-term growth in earnings and cash flows, as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio and to recycle capital.\nWe anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our capital and operating expenses, including costs to maintain our properties and distributions, though we may finance investments, including acquisitions and developments, with the issuance of new shares of our common stock, proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional discussion.\nInflation\nThe U.S. economy has experienced low inflation over the last several years, as a result, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. Our customer leases generally do not provide for annual increases in rent based on inflation. As a result, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of operating and maintaining our data center facilities. Some of our leases have annual rent escalators, typically ranging from 1-3%; as a result we bear the risk of increases in operating costs. Some of our leases are structured to pass-through the cost of sub-metered utilities. In the future, we expect more of our leases to pass-through utility costs. In addition, approximately 70% of our leases expire within six years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at then existing rates.\nSummary of Significant Transactions and Activities for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nReal Estate Acquisitions, Development and Other Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we had cash capital expenditures of $876.4 million, of which $866.5 million related to the construction of data centers. The expansion and development of additional power capacity and building square feet contributed to our year-over-year revenue increase in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining cost to our existing development pipeline is $544.0 million to $634.0 million and are expected to add 92 MWs and 379,902 CSF. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired 74 acres of land in Dublin, the Republic of Ireland, San Antonio, Texas, Santa Clara, California, and Council Bluffs, Iowa for future development for $54.7 million.\nCapital and Financing Activity\nOn December 5, 2019, the Operating Partnership and CyrusOne Finance Corp., a single-purpose finance subsidiary, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (together, the \"Issuers\") completed a public offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% senior notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\") and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.450% senior notes due 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\"). The Company received proceeds of $1,197.4 million, net of underwriting costs and other deferred financing costs. The Company used the proceeds to finance the repurchase of all of its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \"Old 2024 Notes\") and all of its 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 (the \"Old 2027 Notes\" and together with the Old 2024 Notes, the \"Existing Notes\"), including the payment of consent payments, for the redemption and discharge of Existing Notes that remained outstanding after the completion of the tender offers and consent solicitations, for the payment of related premiums, fees, discounts and expenses and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the repurchase of the Existing Notes, the Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $71.8 million.\nIn August 2019, the Company entered into $500.0 million of cross-currency swaps that mature in March 2023 whereby the Company pays floating interest rate and receives floating interest rate to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1-month USD LIBOR versus EUR LIBOR rates (a pay-floating, receive-floating interest rate swap). In addition, in September 2019 the Company entered into a $300.0 million interest rate swap to hedge variable rate exposure to 1-month LIBOR to a fixed rate of 1.185%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold approximately 6.5 million shares of its common stock under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program. The sales generated net proceeds of approximately $355.6 million, net of sales commissions, underwriting discounts and estimated expenses of $4.3 million. As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $290.1 million in remaining capacity of the $750.0 million authorized under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program (as defined in Item 7 under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\").\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, CyrusOne Inc. entered into a forward sale agreement with a financial institution acting as forward purchaser under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program with respect to 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward price of $61.67 per share. The Company has twelve months to settle the forward sale agreement. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of its common shares by the forward purchasers. The Company currently expects to fully physically settle the forward equity sale agreement and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates at the Company's discretion, prior to the final settlement dates under the forward equity sale agreement in November 2020, in which case we expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares specified in such forward equity sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of the agreement will be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchasers' stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends during the term of the agreement. We have not settled any portion of this forward equity sale agreement as of the date of this filing.\nConcentration of revenue\nWe define our annualized backlog as the twelve-month recurring revenue (calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\")) for executed lease contracts achieved upon full occupancy which have not commenced as of the end of a period. Our backlog as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $51.7 million and approximately $54.0 million, respectively. During 2019, one customer represented 21% of our revenue. We expect these backlog lease contracts to primarily commence through the first half of 2020. Because GAAP revenue for any period is generally a function of straight line revenue recognized from lease contracts in existence at the beginning of a period, as well as lease contract renewals and new customer lease contracts commencing during the period, backlog as of any period is not necessarily indicative of near-term performance. Our definition of backlog may differ from other companies in our industry.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are based on historical experiences that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. From time to time we re-evaluate those estimates and assumptions. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of the financial statements.\nOur actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue consists of lease revenue and revenue from contracts with customers. The revenues from colocation rent revenue, metered power reimbursements and interconnection revenue are recognized under the lease accounting standard and revenues from managed services, equipment sales, installations and other services (generally revenue from contracts with customers) are recognized under the revenue accounting standard. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized when the collection of rent receivables is deemed to be unlikely. We adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d), the new accounting standard for leases, effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and prior periods were not restated. In addition, we adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d), the new accounting standard for revenue from contracts with customers, effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. See Note 4, Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Note 5, Revenue Recognition and Note 6, Leases - As a Lessee, in our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information related to the adoption.\nLease Revenue\nOur leasing revenue primarily consists of colocation rent, metered power reimbursements and interconnection revenue and is accounted for under ASC 842, Leases. We generally are not entitled to reimbursements for rental expenses including real estate taxes, insurance or other common area operating expenses. The accounting for leases is highly dependent on the classification of the lease as an operating or finance lease and requires judgment and estimates in evaluating the principles of the new accounting standard for leases, including whether an arrangement is a lease, the fair value of the identified asset, expected lease term and economic life of the asset.\nColocation Rent Revenue\nColocation rent revenues, including interconnection revenue, are fixed minimum lease payments generally billed monthly in advance based on the contracted power or leased space. Some contracts may provide initial free rent periods and rents that escalate over the term of the contract. If rents escalate without the lessee gaining access to or control over additional leased power or space at the beginning of the lease term, the rental payments are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. If rents escalate because the lessee gains access to and control over additional power and or leased space, revenue is recognized in proportion to the additional power or space in the periods that the lessee has control over the use of the additional power or space. The excess of revenue recognized over amounts contractually due is recognized as a straight-line receivable, which is included in rent and other receivables in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Some of our leases are structured on a gross basis in which the customer pays a fixed amount for colocation space and power. The revenue for these types of leases is recorded in colocation rent revenue.\nMetered Power Reimbursements Revenue\nSome of our leases provide that the customer is separately billed for power based upon actual or estimated metered usage at rates then in effect. Metered power reimbursement revenue is variable lease payments generally billed one month in arrears, and an estimate of this revenue is accrued in the month that the associated power is provided and recorded in metered power reimbursements revenue.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nManaged services, equipment sales, installations and other services are recognized under ASC 606.\nEquipment sold by us generally consists of servers, switches, networking equipment, cable infrastructure and cabinets. Revenue is recognized at a point-in-time when control of the equipment transfers to the customer from the Company, which generally occurs upon delivery to the customer.\nManaged services include providing a full-service managed data center, monitoring customer computer equipment, managing backups and storage, utilization reporting and other related ancillary information technology services. Management service contracts generally range from one to five years.\nInstallation services include mounting, wiring, and testing of customer owned equipment. The installation period is typically short term in duration, and accordingly, revenue from the installation of customer equipment is recognized at a point-in-time once the installation is complete and the performance obligation is satisfied. Other services generally include installation of customer equipment, performing customer system re-boots, server cabinet and cage management, power monitoring, shipping and receiving, resolving technical issues, and other services requested by the customer. Other service revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract and recognized over time as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nAcquisition of Properties\nInvestment in real estate consist of land, buildings, improvements and integral equipment utilized in our data center operations. We expect most acquisitions to be asset acquisitions rather than a business combination as our typical acquisitions consist of properties whereby substantially all the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset set (land, building and in-place leases), which are treated as asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are recorded at the cumulative acquisition costs and allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of identifiable tangible assets such as land, building, building and land improvements, and tenant improvements is determined on an as-if-vacant\u201d basis. In estimating the fair value of each component acquired, management uses its judgment and estimates, considers appraisals, replacement cost, its own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties, market rental data and other related information.\nCapitalization of Costs\nWe capitalize costs directly related to the development, pre-development or improvement of our investment in real estate, referred to as capital projects and other activities included within this paragraph. Costs associated with our capital projects are capitalized as incurred. If the project is abandoned, these costs are expensed during the period in which the project is abandoned. The accounting for capitalization of costs requires judgment and estimates to evaluate each project, including the timing and activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, evaluation of direct and indirect project costs, and the allocation of costs to specific projects. Costs considered for capitalization include, but are not limited to, construction costs, interest, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, if appropriate. We capitalize indirect costs such as personnel, office and administrative expenses that are directly related to our development projects based on an estimate of the time spent on the construction and development activities. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. We determine when the capitalization period begins and ends through communication with project and other managers responsible for the tracking and oversight of individual projects. In the event that the activities to ready the asset for its intended use are suspended, the capitalization period will cease until such activities are resumed. In addition, we capitalize incremental initial direct costs incurred for successful origination of new leases which include internal and external leasing commissions. Interest expense is capitalized based on actual qualifying capital expenditures from the period when development commences until the asset is ready for its intended use, at the weighted average borrowing rate during the period. These costs are included in investment in real estate and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related assets.\nCosts incurred for maintaining and repairing our properties, which do not extend their useful lives, are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment\nManagement reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset (or group of assets) and proceeds from its eventual disposition and compare such amount to its carrying amount. To determine the cash flows we consider factors such as future operating income, leasing demand, rental rates, competition and other factors. The estimate of expected future cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies to a considerable extent on management estimates and assumptions, including current and future market conditions, projected growth in our CSF, projected recurring rent churn (as described below), lease renewal rates and our ability to generate new leases on favorable terms. If our undiscounted net cash flows indicate that we are unable to recover the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The evaluation whether assets may not be recoverable and the estimates and assumptions used to determine undiscounted cash flows and fair value requires significant judgment by management.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an impairment loss of $0.7 million, primarily due to an impairment loss on the South Bend-Monroe facility, which is being actively marketed to sell. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized no impairment losses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized impairment losses of $58.0 million which included the impairment loss of $54.4 million for our leased data center facilities in the Connecticut markets and $3.6 million related to our leased facility in Singapore, which are included in impairment losses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nKey Operating Metrics\nAnnualized Rent. We calculate annualized rent as monthly contractual rent (defined as cash rent including customer reimbursements for metered power) under existing customer leases as of December 31, 2019, multiplied by 12. Monthly contractual rent is primarily for data center space, power and connectivity; however, it includes rent for office space and other ancillary services. For the month of December 2019, customer reimbursements were $137.6 million annualized and consisted of reimbursements by customers across all facilities with separately metered power. Other companies may not define annualized rent in the same manner. Accordingly, our annualized rent may not be comparable to others. Management believes annualized rent provides a useful measure of our in-place lease revenue.\nColocation Square Feet (\"CSF\"). We calculate leased total CSF as the NRSF at an operating facility that is leased or readily available for lease as colocation space, where customers locate their servers and other IT equipment.\nLeased Rate. We calculate leased rate by dividing leased total CSF by total CSF. Percent occupied differs from Percent leased. Percent occupied is determined based on occupied CSF billed to customers under signed leases divided by total CSF. Leases signed but that have not commenced are not included.\nRecurring Rent Churn Percentage. We calculate recurring rent churn percentage as any reduction in recurring rent due to customer terminations, service reductions or net pricing decreases as a percentage of rent at the beginning of the period, excluding any impact from metered power reimbursements or other usage-based billing.\nCapital Expenditures. Expenditures that expand, improve or extend the life of real estate and non-real estate property are capital expenditures. Management views its capital expenditures as comprised of acquisitions of real estate, development of real estate, recurring real estate expenditures and all other non-real estate capital expenditures. Purchases of land or buildings from third parties represent acquisitions of real estate. Capital spending that expands or improves our data centers is deemed development of real estate. Replacements of data center equipment are considered recurring real estate expenditures. Purchases of software, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures are included in non-real estate capital expenditures.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nRental Income. Our revenue growth depends on our ability to maintain our existing revenue base and to sell new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development activities. As of December 31, 2019, we have leased approximately 85% of our CSF. Our ability to grow revenue with our existing customers will also be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. We believe the current rates charged to our customers generally reflect appropriate market rates. This is consistent with our relatively flat historical re-leasing spreads. As such, we do not anticipate significant rate increases or decreases in the aggregate as contracts renew. However, negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods. Future economic downturns, regional downturns affecting our markets, or oversupply of or decrease in demand for data center colocation services could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers' leases on favorable terms, and this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase revenues.\nLeasing Arrangements. As of December 31, 2019, 18% of our leased NRSF was to customers on a gross basis. Under a gross lease, the customer pays a fixed monthly rent amount, and we are responsible for all data center facility electricity, maintenance and repair costs, property taxes, insurance and other utilities associated with that customer's space. For leases under this model, fluctuations in our customers' monthly utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us impact our profitability. As of December 31, 2019, 82% of our leased NRSF was to customers with separately billed metered power. Under the metered power model, the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount, plus its actual costs of sub-metered electricity used to power its data center equipment, plus an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center, expressed as a factor of the customer's actual electricity usage. We are responsible for all other costs listed in the description of the gross lease above. Fluctuations in a customer's utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not impact our profitability under the metered power model. In future periods, we expect more of our contracts to be structured to bill power on a metered power basis.\nGrowth and Expansion Activities. Our ability to grow our revenue and profitability will depend on our ability to acquire and develop data center space globally at an appropriate cost and to lease the data center space to customers on favorable terms. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased our operational NRSF by 6.1%, bringing our total operating NRSF to approximately 7.1 million at December 31, 2019. Our portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, also included approximately 1.7 million NRSF under development, as well as 1.9 million NRSF of additional powered shell space under roof available for development. In addition, we have approximately 499 acres of land that are available for future data center shell development. We expect that the eventual construction of this future development space will enable us to accommodate a portion of the future demand of our existing and future customers and increase our future revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nScheduled Lease Expirations. Our ability to maintain low recurring rent churn and renew expiring customer leases on favorable terms will impact our results of operations. Our data center uncommitted capacity as of December 31, 2019, was approximately 1.7 million NRSF. Excluding month-to-month leases, leases representing 11% and 9% of our total NRSF are scheduled to expire in 2020 and 2021, respectively. These leases represented approximately 15% and 16% of our total annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. Month-to-month leases represented 3% of our total annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. Recurring rent churn was 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our recurring rent churn for each quarter in 2019 ranged from 0.6% to 2.1%, in comparison to a range of 0.5% to 2.6% in 2018.\nConditions in Significant Markets. Our properties are located in 13 distinct markets (10 cities in the U.S., plus London, U.K., Singapore and Frankfurt, Germany). Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, New York Metro, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and San Antonio accounted for approximately 83% of our annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. We have recently expanded into development in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Dublin, the Republic of Ireland. General economic conditions and regulations in these markets could impact our overall profitability.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Form 10-K\"). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, statements regarding the industry outlook, our expectations regarding the future performance of our business and the other non-historical statements contained herein are forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d You should also review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K reflect the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of CyrusOne for all periods presented.\nOverview\nOur Company. We are a fully integrated, self-managed data center real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") that owns, operates and develops enterprise-class, carrier-neutral, multi-tenant and single-tenant data center properties. Our data centers are generally purpose-built facilities with redundant power and cooling. They are not network specific and enable customer connectivity to a range of telecommunication carriers. We provide mission-critical data center facilities that protect and ensure the continued operation of information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure for approximately 1,000 customers in 49 data centers, including two recovery centers in 13 markets (10 cities in the U.S., London, U.K., Singapore and Frankfurt, Germany).\nOur Portfolio\nWe own and operate 49 data centers, including two recovery centers totaling 7.1 million Net Rentable Square Feet (\"NRSF\"), of which 85% of the Colocation Square Feet (\"CSF\") is leased and has 797 megawatts (\"MW\") of power capacity. This includes 13 buildings where the Company leases such facilities. We are lessee of approximately 13% of our total operating NRSF as of December 31, 2019. Also included in our total NRSF, CSF and MW are pre-stabilized assets (which include data halls that have been in service for less than 24 months and are less than 85% leased) that have approximately 315,125 NRSF and 28% of the CSF is leased with capacity of 30 MW of power.\nIn addition, we have properties under development comprising approximately 1.7 million NRSF and 92 MW of power capacity. The estimated remaining total costs to develop these properties is estimated to be a range between $544.0 million and $634.0 million. The final costs to develop could change depending on the capital improvements required based on the lease contracts executed on such properties. We also have 499 acres of land available for future data center development.\nIn 2018, we expanded our data center operations through the acquisition of data centers, buildings under development and land for future development in Europe including London, United Kingdom, Frankfurt, Germany, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Dublin, the Republic of Ireland. Through our acquisition of Zenium, we established a team, primarily based in London, U.K., to oversee and manage our European activities.\nOperational Overview\nThe following discussion provides an overview of the Company's capital and financing activity, operations and transactions for the year ended December 31, 2019 and should be read in conjunction with the full discussion of the Company's operating results, liquidity and capital resources included in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A.\nOutlook\nWe seek to maximize long-term earnings growth and shareholder value primarily through increasing cash flow at existing properties and developing high-quality data center assets and campuses at attractive cash yields with long-term, stable operating income. In addition, the Company will, from time to time, acquire existing properties which meet our strategic criteria, offer in-place cash flow and have strong growth prospects.\nFundamentals for data center real estate remain strong, supported by trends that particularly favor data center assets, including the exponential growth in global data, the growth of e-commerce and demand for outsourcing of data storage and cloud-based applications. Growth in large cloud-based demand has moderated in the U.S. in 2019 due to what we believe has been increased supply in major U.S. markets and following very strong absorption in 2018. We anticipate continued general economic growth in\nthe U.S. markets and strong demand in Europe in 2020, which we expect to result in ongoing positive demand for data center space in the markets we operate as companies expand and upgrade information system platforms.\nNew data center development, including speculative development, is present in most domestic and international metropolitan markets in response to strong tenant demand. However, construction remains rational in relation to net absorption in most markets. We expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for market demand for data center real estate.\nIn terms of capital investment, we will continue to pursue selective development of new buildings and the opportunistic acquisition of buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns.\nWe may, from time to time, selectively dispose of non-strategic assets in an effort to enhance long-term growth in earnings and cash flows, as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio and to recycle capital.\nWe anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our capital and operating expenses, including costs to maintain our properties and distributions, though we may finance investments, including acquisitions and developments, with the issuance of new shares of our common stock, proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional discussion.\nInflation\nThe U.S. economy has experienced low inflation over the last several years, as a result, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. Our customer leases generally do not provide for annual increases in rent based on inflation. As a result, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of operating and maintaining our data center facilities. Some of our leases have annual rent escalators, typically ranging from 1-3%; as a result we bear the risk of increases in operating costs. Some of our leases are structured to pass-through the cost of sub-metered utilities. In the future, we expect more of our leases to pass-through utility costs. In addition, approximately 70% of our leases expire within six years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at then existing rates.\nSummary of Significant Transactions and Activities for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nReal Estate Acquisitions, Development and Other Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we had cash capital expenditures of $876.4 million, of which $866.5 million related to the construction of data centers. The expansion and development of additional power capacity and building square feet contributed to our year-over-year revenue increase in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining cost to our existing development pipeline is $544.0 million to $634.0 million and are expected to add 92 MWs and 379,902 CSF. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired 74 acres of land in Dublin, the Republic of Ireland, San Antonio, Texas, Santa Clara, California, and Council Bluffs, Iowa for future development for $54.7 million.\nCapital and Financing Activity\nOn December 5, 2019, the Operating Partnership and CyrusOne Finance Corp., a single-purpose finance subsidiary, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (together, the \"Issuers\") completed a public offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% senior notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\") and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.450% senior notes due 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\"). The Company received proceeds of $1,197.4 million, net of underwriting costs and other deferred financing costs. The Company used the proceeds to finance the repurchase of all of its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \"Old 2024 Notes\") and all of its 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 (the \"Old 2027 Notes\" and together with the Old 2024 Notes, the \"Existing Notes\"), including the payment of consent payments, for the redemption and discharge of Existing Notes that remained outstanding after the completion of the tender offers and consent solicitations, for the payment of related premiums, fees, discounts and expenses and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the repurchase of the Existing Notes, the Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $71.8 million.\nIn August 2019, the Company entered into $500.0 million of cross-currency swaps that mature in March 2023 whereby the Company pays floating interest rate and receives floating interest rate to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1-month USD LIBOR versus EUR LIBOR rates (a pay-floating, receive-floating interest rate swap). In addition, in September 2019 the Company entered into a $300.0 million interest rate swap to hedge variable rate exposure to 1-month LIBOR to a fixed rate of 1.185%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold approximately 6.5 million shares of its common stock under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program. The sales generated net proceeds of approximately $355.6 million, net of sales commissions, underwriting discounts and estimated expenses of $4.3 million. As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $290.1 million in remaining capacity of the $750.0 million authorized under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program (as defined in Item 7 under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\").\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, CyrusOne Inc. entered into a forward sale agreement with a financial institution acting as forward purchaser under the New 2018 ATM Stock Offering Program with respect to 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward price of $61.67 per share. The Company has twelve months to settle the forward sale agreement. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of its common shares by the forward purchasers. The Company currently expects to fully physically settle the forward equity sale agreement and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates at the Company's discretion, prior to the final settlement dates under the forward equity sale agreement in November 2020, in which case we expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares specified in such forward equity sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of the agreement will be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchasers' stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends during the term of the agreement. We have not settled any portion of this forward equity sale agreement as of the date of this filing.\nConcentration of revenue\nWe define our annualized backlog as the twelve-month recurring revenue (calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\")) for executed lease contracts achieved upon full occupancy which have not commenced as of the end of a period. Our backlog as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $51.7 million and approximately $54.0 million, respectively. During 2019, one customer represented 21% of our revenue. We expect these backlog lease contracts to primarily commence through the first half of 2020. Because GAAP revenue for any period is generally a function of straight line revenue recognized from lease contracts in existence at the beginning of a period, as well as lease contract renewals and new customer lease contracts commencing during the period, backlog as of any period is not necessarily indicative of near-term performance. Our definition of backlog may differ from other companies in our industry.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are based on historical experiences that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. From time to time we re-evaluate those estimates and assumptions. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of the financial statements.\nOur actual results may differ from these estimates. We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue consists of lease revenue and revenue from contracts with customers. The revenues from colocation rent revenue, metered power reimbursements and interconnection revenue are recognized under the lease accounting standard and revenues from managed services, equipment sales, installations and other services (generally revenue from contracts with customers) are recognized under the revenue accounting standard. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized when the collection of rent receivables is deemed to be unlikely. We adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d), the new accounting standard for leases, effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and prior periods were not restated. In addition, we adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d), the new accounting standard for revenue from contracts with customers, effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. See Note 4, Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Note 5, Revenue Recognition and Note 6, Leases - As a Lessee, in our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information related to the adoption.\nLease Revenue\nOur leasing revenue primarily consists of colocation rent, metered power reimbursements and interconnection revenue and is accounted for under ASC 842, Leases. We generally are not entitled to reimbursements for rental expenses including real estate taxes, insurance or other common area operating expenses. The accounting for leases is highly dependent on the classification of the lease as an operating or finance lease and requires judgment and estimates in evaluating the principles of the new accounting standard for leases, including whether an arrangement is a lease, the fair value of the identified asset, expected lease term and economic life of the asset.\nColocation Rent Revenue\nColocation rent revenues, including interconnection revenue, are fixed minimum lease payments generally billed monthly in advance based on the contracted power or leased space. Some contracts may provide initial free rent periods and rents that escalate over the term of the contract. If rents escalate without the lessee gaining access to or control over additional leased power or space at the beginning of the lease term, the rental payments are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. If rents escalate because the lessee gains access to and control over additional power and or leased space, revenue is recognized in proportion to the additional power or space in the periods that the lessee has control over the use of the additional power or space. The excess of revenue recognized over amounts contractually due is recognized as a straight-line receivable, which is included in rent and other receivables in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Some of our leases are structured on a gross basis in which the customer pays a fixed amount for colocation space and power. The revenue for these types of leases is recorded in colocation rent revenue.\nMetered Power Reimbursements Revenue\nSome of our leases provide that the customer is separately billed for power based upon actual or estimated metered usage at rates then in effect. Metered power reimbursement revenue is variable lease payments generally billed one month in arrears, and an estimate of this revenue is accrued in the month that the associated power is provided and recorded in metered power reimbursements revenue.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nManaged services, equipment sales, installations and other services are recognized under ASC 606.\nEquipment sold by us generally consists of servers, switches, networking equipment, cable infrastructure and cabinets. Revenue is recognized at a point-in-time when control of the equipment transfers to the customer from the Company, which generally occurs upon delivery to the customer.\nManaged services include providing a full-service managed data center, monitoring customer computer equipment, managing backups and storage, utilization reporting and other related ancillary information technology services. Management service contracts generally range from one to five years.\nInstallation services include mounting, wiring, and testing of customer owned equipment. The installation period is typically short term in duration, and accordingly, revenue from the installation of customer equipment is recognized at a point-in-time once the installation is complete and the performance obligation is satisfied. Other services generally include installation of customer equipment, performing customer system re-boots, server cabinet and cage management, power monitoring, shipping and receiving, resolving technical issues, and other services requested by the customer. Other service revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract and recognized over time as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nAcquisition of Properties\nInvestment in real estate consist of land, buildings, improvements and integral equipment utilized in our data center operations. We expect most acquisitions to be asset acquisitions rather than a business combination as our typical acquisitions consist of properties whereby substantially all the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset set (land, building and in-place leases), which are treated as asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are recorded at the cumulative acquisition costs and allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of identifiable tangible assets such as land, building, building and land improvements, and tenant improvements is determined on an as-if-vacant\u201d basis. In estimating the fair value of each component acquired, management uses its judgment and estimates, considers appraisals, replacement cost, its own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties, market rental data and other related information.\nCapitalization of Costs\nWe capitalize costs directly related to the development, pre-development or improvement of our investment in real estate, referred to as capital projects and other activities included within this paragraph. Costs associated with our capital projects are capitalized as incurred. If the project is abandoned, these costs are expensed during the period in which the project is abandoned. The accounting for capitalization of costs requires judgment and estimates to evaluate each project, including the timing and activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, evaluation of direct and indirect project costs, and the allocation of costs to specific projects. Costs considered for capitalization include, but are not limited to, construction costs, interest, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, if appropriate. We capitalize indirect costs such as personnel, office and administrative expenses that are directly related to our development projects based on an estimate of the time spent on the construction and development activities. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. We determine when the capitalization period begins and ends through communication with project and other managers responsible for the tracking and oversight of individual projects. In the event that the activities to ready the asset for its intended use are suspended, the capitalization period will cease until such activities are resumed. In addition, we capitalize incremental initial direct costs incurred for successful origination of new leases which include internal and external leasing commissions. Interest expense is capitalized based on actual qualifying capital expenditures from the period when development commences until the asset is ready for its intended use, at the weighted average borrowing rate during the period. These costs are included in investment in real estate and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related assets.\nCosts incurred for maintaining and repairing our properties, which do not extend their useful lives, are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment\nManagement reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset (or group of assets) and proceeds from its eventual disposition and compare such amount to its carrying amount. To determine the cash flows we consider factors such as future operating income, leasing demand, rental rates, competition and other factors. The estimate of expected future cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies to a considerable extent on management estimates and assumptions, including current and future market conditions, projected growth in our CSF, projected recurring rent churn (as described below), lease renewal rates and our ability to generate new leases on favorable terms. If our undiscounted net cash flows indicate that we are unable to recover the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The evaluation whether assets may not be recoverable and the estimates and assumptions used to determine undiscounted cash flows and fair value requires significant judgment by management.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an impairment loss of $0.7 million, primarily due to an impairment loss on the South Bend-Monroe facility, which is being actively marketed to sell. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized no impairment losses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized impairment losses of $58.0 million which included the impairment loss of $54.4 million for our leased data center facilities in the Connecticut markets and $3.6 million related to our leased facility in Singapore, which are included in impairment losses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nKey Operating Metrics\nAnnualized Rent. We calculate annualized rent as monthly contractual rent (defined as cash rent including customer reimbursements for metered power) under existing customer leases as of December 31, 2019, multiplied by 12. Monthly contractual rent is primarily for data center space, power and connectivity; however, it includes rent for office space and other ancillary services. For the month of December 2019, customer reimbursements were $137.6 million annualized and consisted of reimbursements by customers across all facilities with separately metered power. Other companies may not define annualized rent in the same manner. Accordingly, our annualized rent may not be comparable to others. Management believes annualized rent provides a useful measure of our in-place lease revenue.\nColocation Square Feet (\"CSF\"). We calculate leased total CSF as the NRSF at an operating facility that is leased or readily available for lease as colocation space, where customers locate their servers and other IT equipment.\nLeased Rate. We calculate leased rate by dividing leased total CSF by total CSF. Percent occupied differs from Percent leased. Percent occupied is determined based on occupied CSF billed to customers under signed leases divided by total CSF. Leases signed but that have not commenced are not included.\nRecurring Rent Churn Percentage. We calculate recurring rent churn percentage as any reduction in recurring rent due to customer terminations, service reductions or net pricing decreases as a percentage of rent at the beginning of the period, excluding any impact from metered power reimbursements or other usage-based billing.\nCapital Expenditures. Expenditures that expand, improve or extend the life of real estate and non-real estate property are capital expenditures. Management views its capital expenditures as comprised of acquisitions of real estate, development of real estate, recurring real estate expenditures and all other non-real estate capital expenditures. Purchases of land or buildings from third parties represent acquisitions of real estate. Capital spending that expands or improves our data centers is deemed development of real estate. Replacements of data center equipment are considered recurring real estate expenditures. Purchases of software, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures are included in non-real estate capital expenditures.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nRental Income. Our revenue growth depends on our ability to maintain our existing revenue base and to sell new capacity that becomes available as a result of our development activities. As of December 31, 2019, we have leased approximately 85% of our CSF. Our ability to grow revenue with our existing customers will also be affected by our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. We believe the current rates charged to our customers generally reflect appropriate market rates. This is consistent with our relatively flat historical re-leasing spreads. As such, we do not anticipate significant rate increases or decreases in the aggregate as contracts renew. However, negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenue in future periods. Future economic downturns, regional downturns affecting our markets, or oversupply of or decrease in demand for data center colocation services could impair our ability to attract new customers or renew existing customers' leases on favorable terms, and this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase revenues.\nLeasing Arrangements. As of December 31, 2019, 18% of our leased NRSF was to customers on a gross basis. Under a gross lease, the customer pays a fixed monthly rent amount, and we are responsible for all data center facility electricity, maintenance and repair costs, property taxes, insurance and other utilities associated with that customer's space. For leases under this model, fluctuations in our customers' monthly utilization of power and the prices our utility providers charge us impact our profitability. As of December 31, 2019, 82% of our leased NRSF was to customers with separately billed metered power. Under the metered power model, the customer pays us a fixed monthly rent amount, plus its actual costs of sub-metered electricity used to power its data center equipment, plus an estimate of costs for electricity used to power supporting infrastructure for the data center, expressed as a factor of the customer's actual electricity usage. We are responsible for all other costs listed in the description of the gross lease above. Fluctuations in a customer's utilization of power and the supplier pricing of power do not impact our profitability under the metered power model. In future periods, we expect more of our contracts to be structured to bill power on a metered power basis.\nGrowth and Expansion Activities. Our ability to grow our revenue and profitability will depend on our ability to acquire and develop data center space globally at an appropriate cost and to lease the data center space to customers on favorable terms. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased our operational NRSF by 6.1%, bringing our total operating NRSF to approximately 7.1 million at December 31, 2019. Our portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, also included approximately 1.7 million NRSF under development, as well as 1.9 million NRSF of additional powered shell space under roof available for development. In addition, we have approximately 499 acres of land that are available for future data center shell development. We expect that the eventual construction of this future development space will enable us to accommodate a portion of the future demand of our existing and future customers and increase our future revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nScheduled Lease Expirations. Our ability to maintain low recurring rent churn and renew expiring customer leases on favorable terms will impact our results of operations. Our data center uncommitted capacity as of December 31, 2019, was approximately 1.7 million NRSF. Excluding month-to-month leases, leases representing 11% and 9% of our total NRSF are scheduled to expire in 2020 and 2021, respectively. These leases represented approximately 15% and 16% of our total annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. Month-to-month leases represented 3% of our total annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. Recurring rent churn was 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our recurring rent churn for each quarter in 2019 ranged from 0.6% to 2.1%, in comparison to a range of 0.5% to 2.6% in 2018.\nConditions in Significant Markets. Our properties are located in 13 distinct markets (10 cities in the U.S., plus London, U.K., Singapore and Frankfurt, Germany). Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, New York Metro, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and San Antonio accounted for approximately 83% of our annualized rent as of December 31, 2019. We have recently expanded into development in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Dublin, the Republic of Ireland. General economic conditions and regulations in these markets could impact our overall profitability.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IN MILLIONS, except per share data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>$ Change\n2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>% Change\n2019 vs. 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colocation rent\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>793.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>684.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metered power reimbursements\n</td> <td>138.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment sales\n</td> <td>29.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>981.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating expenses\n</td> <td>383.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>83.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>417.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction, acquisition, integration and other related expenses\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>914.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>731.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>67.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(25.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(82.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(94.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on marketable equity investment\n</td> <td>132.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment"}
