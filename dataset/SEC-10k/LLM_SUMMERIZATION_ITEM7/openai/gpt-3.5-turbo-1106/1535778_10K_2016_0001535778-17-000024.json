Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nStatements we make in the following discussion which express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a specialty finance company sponsored by Hines that makes debt and equity investments in Middle Market and LMM companies. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We are, therefore, required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under the Code.\nOur primary investment objective is to generate current income through debt and equity investments. A secondary objective is to generate long-term capital appreciation through equity and equity-related investments including warrants, convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities. Our portfolio strategy calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by LMM companies and Middle Market companies in private placements and negotiated transactions, which are traded in private over-the-counter markets for institutional investors. We will also invest in, and a significant portion of our assets are invested in, customized direct secured and unsecured loans to and equity securities of LMM companies, referred to as LMM securities. Typically, our investments in LMM companies will require us to co-invest with Main Street and/or its affiliates. We categorize some of our investments in LMM companies and Middle Market companies as Private Loan portfolio investments. Private Loan investments, often referred to in the debt markets as club deals,\u201d are investments, generally in debt instruments, that we originate on a collaborative basis with other investment funds. Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our portfolio also includes Other Portfolio investments primarily consisting of investments managed by third parties, which differ from the typical profiles for our LMM portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments or Private Loan portfolio investments.\nAs a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments, including limitations on our ability to co-invest with certain affiliates, including Main Street. However, we received an order from the SEC that permits us, subject to certain conditions, to co-invest with Main Street in certain transactions originated by Main Street and/or our Advisers. The exemptive relief permits us, and certain of our directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries on one hand, and Main Street, and/or certain of its affiliates on the other hand, to co-invest in the same investment opportunities where such investment may otherwise be prohibited under Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may continue to co-invest with Main Street and/or its affiliates in syndicated deals and secondary loan market purchases in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance or interpretations where price is the only negotiated point.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had investments in 75 Middle Market debt investments, 29 Private Loan debt investments, 29 LMM debt investments, 28 LMM equity investments, nine Private Loan equity investments, five Middle Market equity investments and three Other Portfolio investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $989.2 million, a cost basis of approximately $1.0 billion, and a weighted average effective annual yield of approximately 8.9%. The weighted average annual yield was calculated using the effective interest rates for all investments at December 31, 2016, including accretion of original issue discount and amortization of the premium to par value, the amortization of fees received in connection with transactions, and assumes zero yield for investments on non-accrual status. Approximately 80.0% and 11.6% of our total portfolio investments (at fair value) were secured by first priority liens and second priority liens on portfolio company assets, respectively, with the remainder in unsecured debt investments and equity investments.\nThe level of new portfolio investment activity will fluctuate from period to period based upon the status of our capital raising efforts under the Offering, our view of the current economic fundamentals, our ability to identify new investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria and our ability to close on the identified transactions. The level of new investment activity and associated interest and fee income will directly impact future investment income. While we intend to grow our portfolio and our investment income over the long-term, our growth and our operating results may be more limited during depressed economic periods. However, we intend to appropriately manage our cost structure and liquidity position based on applicable economic conditions and our investment outlook. The level of realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation will also\nfluctuate depending upon portfolio activity and the performance of our individual portfolio companies. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results.\nInvestment Income\nWe have generated, and plan to continue to generate, investment income primarily in the form of interest on the debt securities that we hold, dividends and other distributions with respect to any equity interests that we hold and capital gains, if any, on convertible debt or other equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. All such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned or as additional yield over the life of the debt investment. To date our investment income has been interest income on debt investments, accretion of original issue discounts, dividend income, amortization of premiums and fees received from transactions and net realized/unrealized appreciation (depreciation).\nExpenses\nOn both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to our stockholders. Our primary operating expenses will be debt service payments, general and administrative expenses and payment of advisory fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The investment advisory fees paid to our Adviser (and the fees paid by our Adviser to our Sub-Adviser pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement) will compensate our Advisers for their work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. We expect our expenses to fluctuate based upon the amount of assets under management.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including fees and expenses relating to:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to certain limitations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of calculating our NAV, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of effecting sales and repurchase of shares of our common stock and other securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, monitoring our financial and legal affairs, making investments, and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest payable on debt, if any, including any hedging costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>investment advisory fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>transfer agent and custodial fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>federal and state registration fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>federal, state and local taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>independent directors' fees and expenses, including travel expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of director and stockholder meetings, proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cost of fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>direct costs such as printing of stockholder reports and advertising or sales materials, mailing, long distance telephone, and staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the 1940 Act, and other applicable federal and state securities laws;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable federal and state securities laws;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>brokerage commissions for our investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>all other expenses incurred by our Advisers in performing their obligations, subject to the limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>all other expenses incurred by us or any administrator in connection with administering our business, including payments under any administration agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by any administrator in performing its obligations under any proposed administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines.\nBase Management and Incentive Fee, Administrative Services Expense Waiver and Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement\nFrom time to time, our Advisers may waive certain fees accrued under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Sub-Advisory Agreement, as applicable, and our Adviser may pay to us Expense Support Payments. We may reimburse such waived fees and Expense Support Payments within three years from the date of each respective fee waiver and from the date that each respective Expense Support Payment was determined. See Note 10 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information on our fee waivers and expense reimbursements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Under the 1940 Act rules, regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X and Topic 946 of the Accounting Standards Codification, as amended (the ASC\u201d), of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), Financial Accounting Services-Investment Companies, we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest, unless the portfolio company is a wholly-owned investment company. An exception to this general principle occurs if we own a controlled operating company whose purpose is to provide services to us such as an investment adviser or transfer agent. None of our investments qualifies for this exception. Therefore, our portfolio company investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes to fair value recognized as Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations until the investment is realized, usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss on exit being recognized as a realized gain or loss. However, in the event that any controlled subsidiary exceeds the tests of significance set forth in Rules 3-09 or 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, we will include required financial information for such subsidiary in the notes or as an attachment to our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Classification\nWe classify our investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, (a) Control\u201d investments are defined as investments in companies in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities or has rights to nominate greater than 50% of the directors or managers of the entity, (b) Affiliate\u201d investments are defined as investments in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned, or an investment in an investment company's investment adviser, and the investments are not classified as Control investments and (c) Non-Control/Non-Affiliate\u201d investments are defined as investments that are neither Control investments nor Affiliated investments.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe account for our portfolio investments at fair value under the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.\nOur portfolio strategy calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by private, LMM companies and debt securities issued by Middle Market companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies. We categorize some of our investments in LMM companies and Middle Market companies as Private Loan portfolio investments. Private Loan investments, often referred to in the debt markets as club deals,\u201d are investments, generally in debt instruments, that we originate on a collaborative basis with other investment funds or lenders. Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to the investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our portfolio also includes Other Portfolio investments primarily consisting of investments managed by third parties, which differ from the typical profiles for our LMM portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments or Private Loan portfolio investments. Our portfolio\ninvestments may be subject to restrictions on resale. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Investments - The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\u201d\nLMM investments and Other Portfolio investments generally have no established trading market while Middle Market securities generally have established markets that are not active. Private Loan investments may include investments which have no established trading market or have established markets that are not active. We determine in good faith the fair value of our investment portfolio pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with ASC 820 and a valuation process approved by our board of directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act. Our valuation policies and processes are intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio.\nFor LMM portfolio investments, we generally review external events, including private mergers, sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies, and includes these events in the valuation process by using an enterprise value waterfall ( Waterfall\u201d) for our LMM equity investments and an income approach using a yield-to-maturity model ( Yield-to-Maturity\u201d) for our LMM debt investments. For Middle Market portfolio investments, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in the valuation process. We determine the appropriateness of the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer, the depth and consistency of broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance of the portfolio company and other market indices. We often cannot observe the inputs considered by the third party in determining their quotes. For Middle Market and Private Loan portfolio investments in debt securities for which it has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, we generally estimate the fair value based on the assumptions that we believe hypothetical market participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method. For our Other Portfolio equity investments, we generally calculate the fair value of the investment primarily based on the NAV of the fund. All of the valuation approaches for our portfolio investments estimate the value of the investment as if we were to sell, or exit, the investment as of the measurement date.\nUnder the Waterfall valuation method, we estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company using a combination of market and income approaches or other appropriate valuation methods, such as considering recent transactions in the equity securities of the portfolio company or third-party valuations of the portfolio company, and then perform a Waterfall calculation by using the enterprise value over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another. The enterprise value is the fair value at which an enterprise could be sold in a transaction between two willing parties, rather than through a forced or liquidation sale. Typically, private companies are bought and sold based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. There is no single methodology for estimating enterprise value. For any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally described as a range of values from which a single estimate of enterprise value is derived. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyze various factors including the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results. The operating results of a portfolio company may include unaudited, projected, budgeted or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for non-recurring items or to normalize the operating results that may require significant judgment in its determination. In addition, projecting future financial results requires significant judgment regarding future growth assumptions. In evaluating the operating results, we also analyze the impact of exposure to litigation, loss of customers or other contingencies. After determining the appropriate enterprise value, we allocate the enterprise value to investments in order of the legal priority of the various components of the portfolio company's capital structure. In applying the Waterfall valuation method, we assume the loans are paid off at the principal amount in a change in control transaction and are not assumed by the buyer, which we believe is consistent with our past transaction history and standard industry practices.\nUnder the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method, we also use the income approach to determine the fair value of debt securities based on projections of the discounted future free cash flows that the debt security will likely generate, including analyzing the discounted cash flows of interest and principal amounts for the debt security, as set forth in the associated loan agreements, as well as the financial position and credit risk of the portfolio investments. We estimate the expected repayment date of our debt securities is generally the legal maturity date of the instrument, as we generally intend to hold our loans and debt securities to maturity. The Yield-to-Maturity analysis also considers changes in leverage levels, credit quality, portfolio company performance and other factors. We will generally use the value determined by the Yield-to-Maturity analysis as the fair value for that security. However, it is our position that assuming a borrower is outperforming underwriting expectations and because these respective investments do not generally contain pre-payment penalties, the borrower would most likely prepay or refinance the borrowing if the market interest rate, given the borrower's credit quality, is lower than the stated loan interest rate. Therefore, we do not believe that a market participant would pay a premium for the investment, and because of our general intent to hold its loans to maturity, we generally do not believe that the fair value of the investment should be adjusted in excess of the face amount. A change in the assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our debt securities using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method could have a material impact on the determination of fair value. If there is deterioration in credit quality or if a debt security is in workout status, we may consider other factors in determining the fair value of the debt security, including the value attributable\nto the debt security from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would most likely be received in a liquidation analysis.\nUnder the NAV valuation method, for an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, we measure the fair value of the investment predominately based on the NAV of the investment fund as of the measurement date. However, in determining the fair value of the investment, we may consider whether adjustments to the NAV are necessary in certain circumstances, based on the analysis of any restrictions on redemption of our investment as of the measurement date, recent actual sales or redemptions of interests in the investment fund, and expected future cash flows available to equity holders, including the rate of return on those cash flows compared to an implied market return on equity required by market participants, or other uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize the full NAV of our interests in the investment fund.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors will undertake a multi-step valuation process, as described below:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by investment professionals of our Advisers responsible for credit monitoring.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and our Advisers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For our LMM portfolio companies and certain Private Loan portfolio companies, we have valuations reviewed by an independent valuation firm on a periodic basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to our internal valuation process and the requirements under the 1940 Act, we perform valuation procedures on our unquoted investments in LMM portfolio companies and certain Private Loan portfolio companies (the Internally Valued Investments\u201d) at least once a quarter. Among other things, we generally consult with a nationally recognized independent valuation firm on the Internally Valued Investments at least once in every calendar year, and for new Internally Valued Investments, at least once in the twelve-month period subsequent to the initial investment. In certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in our stockholders' best interest, to consult with the nationally recognized independent valuation firm on our investments in one or more of these Internally Valued Investments. Such instances include situations where the fair value of our investment is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we consulted with our independent valuation firm in arriving at our determination of fair value on our investments in a total of 21 of the 23 LMM portfolio companies and in a total of 15 of the 29 Private Loan portfolio companies. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we consulted with our independent valuation firm in arriving at our determination of fair value on our investments in a total of 11 of the 16 LMM portfolio companies and in a total of seven of the 20 Private Loan portfolio companies.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our estimate of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We estimate the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest, Fee and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Prepayment penalties received by us are recorded as income upon receipt. Dividend income is recorded when dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Accrued interest and dividend income are evaluated quarterly for collectability. When a debt security becomes 90 days or more past due and we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, the debt security will generally be placed on non-accrual status, and we will cease recognizing interest income on that debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any previously accrued interest, then the interest income will be written off. Additionally, if a debt security has deferred interest payment terms and we become aware of a deterioration in the credit quality, we will evaluate the collectability of the deferred interest payment. If it is determined that the deferred interest is unlikely to be collected, we will place the security on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay the contractual amounts due. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. If a debt security's status significantly improves with respect to the debtor's ability to service the debt or other obligations, or if a debt security is fully impaired, sold or written off, it will be removed from non-accrual status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had five debt investments in four portfolio companies that were more than 90 days past due (two of which were in the oil and gas industry), including three debt investments in two portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status. Each of these portfolio companies experienced a significant decline in credit quality raising doubt regarding our ability to collect the principal and interest contractually due. Given the credit deterioration,we ceased accruing interest income on the non-accrual debt investments and wrote off any previously accrued interest deemed uncollectable. There was no allowance recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016. Aside from these three investments on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2016, we are not aware of any material changes to the creditworthiness of the borrowers underlying its debt investments.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had three debt investments in two portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status including two debt investments in one portfolio company that were more than 90 days past due. Each of these portfolio companies experienced a significant decline in credit quality raising doubt regarding our ability to collect the principal and interest contractually due. Given the credit deterioration, we have recognized no interest income on two of the three non-accrual debt investments during the year ended December 31, 2015. For the other non-accrual debt investment, an allowance of $196,000 was booked for the interest income recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2015.\nFrom time to time, we may hold debt instruments in our investment portfolio that contain a PIK interest provision. If these borrowers elect to pay or are obligated to pay interest under the optional PIK provision, and, if deemed collectible, then the interest would be computed at the contractual rate specified in the investment's credit agreement, recorded as interest income and periodically added to the principal balance of the investment. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. We stop accruing PIK interest and write off any accrued and uncollected interest in arrears when we determine that such PIK interest in arrears is no longer collectible.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015 we held 19 and seven investments, respectively, which contained a PIK provision. As discussed above, two of the 19 investments with PIK provisions as of December 31, 2016 and two of the seven investments with PIK provisions as of December 31, 2015 were on non-accrual status. No PIK interest was recorded on these investments during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized approximately $469,000, $1.2 million and $274,000, respectively, of PIK interest. We stop accruing PIK interest and write off any accrued and uncollected interest in arrears when we determine that such PIK interest in arrears is no longer collectible.\nWe may periodically provide services, including structuring and advisory services, to our portfolio companies or other third parties. The income from such services is non-recurring. For services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value, income is recognized as earned, which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes. Fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are deferred and accreted into interest income over the life of the financing.\nA presentation of the investment income we received from our investment portfolio in each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands) is as follows:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest, Fee and Dividend Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Fee Income\n</td> <td>1,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Dividend Income\n</td> <td>2,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest, Fee and Dividend Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnearned Income - Original Issue Discount / Premium to Par Value\nWe purchased some of our debt investments for an amount different than their respective principal values. For purchases at less than par value a discount is recorded at acquisition, which is accreted into interest income based on the effective interest method over the life of the debt investment. For purchases at greater than par value, a premium is recorded at acquisition, which is amortized as a reduction to interest income based on the effective interest method over the life of the investment. Upon repayment or sale, any unamortized discount or premium is also recognized into interest income. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we accreted approximately a net $11.9 million, $4.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, into interest income.\nOffering Costs\nIn accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Sub-Advisory Agreement, we reimburse our Advisers for any offering costs that are paid on our behalf, which consist of, among other things, actual legal, accounting, bona fide out-of-pocket itemized and detailed due diligence costs, printing, filing fees, transfer agent costs, postage, escrow fees, data processing fees, advertising and sales literature and other offering costs. Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement, we expect to reimburse the Advisers for such costs incurred on our behalf on a monthly basis, up to a maximum aggregate amount of 1.5% of the gross stock offering proceeds. The Advisers are responsible for the payment of offering costs to the extent they exceed 1.5% of the aggregate gross stock offering proceeds.\nPrior to January 1, 2016, offering costs were capitalized as incurred by our Advisers, and such costs, up to 1.5% of the gross proceeds, were recorded as a charge to additional paid in capital and a reduction of deferred offering costs. Effective January 1, 2016, we capitalize offering costs as deferred offering costs as incurred by us and subsequently amortize such costs to expense over a 12-month period to more closely track applicable guidance. Deferred offering costs related to an offering will be fully amortized to expense upon the expiration or earlier termination of an offering. We currently expect offering costs to be fully amortized by September 30, 2017, the anticipated date of the Closing. We evaluated this change in accounting treatment of offering costs and determined that it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for periods prior to January 1, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) convert dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income into ordinary income, (ii) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for deductions available to certain U.S. corporations under the Code as ineligible for such treatment, (iii) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (iv) convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (v) convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses, (vi) convert an ordinary loss or deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (vii) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (viii) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions, and (ix) produce gross income that will not constitute qualifying gross income for purposes of the gross income requirement that applies to RICs. These rules also could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions on our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.\nSome of the income that we might otherwise earn, such as fees for providing managerial assistance, certain fees earned with respect to our investments, income recognized in a work-out or restructuring of a portfolio investment, or income recognized from an equity investment in an operating partnership, may not satisfy the 90% Income Test. To manage the risk that such income might disqualify us as a RIC for failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may establish one or more Taxable Subsidiaries to hold assets from which we do not anticipate earning qualifying income under the 90% Income Test. Any investments held through a Taxable Subsidiary generally will be subject to U.S. federal income and other taxes, and therefore we can expect to achieve a reduced after-tax yield on such investments).\nUncertainty in Income Taxes\nWe evaluate our tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax benefits or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is more likely than not\u201d to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nPORTFOLIO INVESTMENT COMPOSITION\nOur Middle Market portfolio investments primarily consist of direct or secondary purchases of interest-bearing debt securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our LMM portfolio. While our Middle Market debt investments are generally secured by a first priority lien, 17.0% of the fair value of our Middle Market portfolio is secured by second priority liens.\nOur current LMM portfolio consists of debt investments secured by first and second priority liens (64.3% and 3.3% of the total fair value of the LMM portfolio, respectively) on the assets of the portfolio companies and equity investments (32.4% of the total\nfair value of the LMM portfolio) in privately held LMM companies as of December 31, 2016. The LMM debt investments generally mature between five and seven years from the original investment date. The LMM equity investments represent an equity position or the right to acquire an equity position through warrants.\nOur Private Loan portfolio primarily consists of debt investments secured by first and second priority liens (91.5% and 0.7% of the total fair value of the Private Loan portfolio, respectively) on the assets of the portfolio companies, unsecured debt investments (4.9% of the total fair value of the Private Loan portfolio) and equity investments (2.9% of the total fair value of the Private Loan portfolio) in six Private Loan companies as of December 31, 2016. The Private Loan debt investments typically have stated terms between three and seven years from the original investment date. The Private Loan equity investments represent an equity position or the right to acquire an equity position through warrants.\nOur Other Portfolio investments primarily consist of investments managed by third parties, which differ from the typical profiles for LMM, Middle Market and Private Loan portfolio investments. In the Other Portfolio investments, we may incur indirect fees and expenses in connection with investments managed by third parties, such as investments in other investment companies or private funds.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we funded investment purchases of approximately $464.9 million and had three investments under contract to purchase as of December 31, 2016, for approximately $11.0 million, which settled or we scheduled to settle after December 31, 2016. We also received proceeds from sales and repayments of existing portfolio investments of approximately $349.6 million including $106.6 million in sales. Additionally, we had two investments under contract to sell as of December 31, 2016, for approximately $7.6 million, which represented the contract sales price. The combined result of these transactions increased our portfolio, on a cost basis, by approximately $97.7 million, or 10.8%, and the number of portfolio investments by 31, or 21.1%, compared to the portfolio as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the largest investment in an individual portfolio company represented approximately 1.8% of our portfolio's fair value with the remaining investments in an individual portfolio company ranging from 0.01% to 1.6%. The average single investment in our portfolio is approximately $5.6 million or 0.6% of the total portfolio. As a result of these transactions, our portfolio has become increasingly broadened across individual portfolio investments, geographic regions, and industries. Further, our total portfolio's investment composition (excluding our Other Portfolio investments) at fair value is comprised of 81.5% first lien debt securities, 11.8% second lien debt securities, with the remainder in unsecured debt investments and equity investments. First lien debt securities have priority over subordinated debt owed by the issuer with respect to the collateral pledged as security for the loan. Due to the relative priority of payment of first lien investments, these generally have lower yields than lower priority, less secured investments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we funded investment purchases of approximately $631.1 million and had five investments under contract to purchase as of December 31, 2015 for approximately $11.7 million, which settled or we scheduled to settle after December 31, 2015. We also received proceeds from sales and repayments of existing portfolio investments of approximately $176.1 million including $45.7 million in sales. Additionally, we had one investment under contract to sell as of December 31, 2015, for approximately $2.0 million, which represented the contract sales price. The combined result of which increased our portfolio, on a cost basis, by approximately $417.1 million, or 85.5%, and the number of portfolio investments by 38, or 34.9%, compared to the portfolio as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the largest investment in an individual portfolio company represented approximately 2.3% of our portfolio's fair value with the remaining investments in an individual portfolio company ranging from 0.03% to 1.8%. The average single investment in our portfolio is approximately $5.8 million or 0.7% of the total portfolio. As a result of these transactions, our portfolio has become increasingly broadened across individual portfolio investments, geographic regions, and industries. Further, our total portfolio's investment composition (excluding our Other Portfolio investments) at fair value is comprised of 80.3% first lien debt securities, 16.7% second lien debt securities, with the remainder in unsecured debt investments and equity investments. First lien debt securities have priority over subordinated debt owed by the issuer with respect to the collateral pledged as security for the loan. Due to the relative priority of payment of first lien investments, these generally have lower yields than lower priority, less secured investments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we made investment purchases of approximately $477.5 million and had 11 investments under contract to purchase as of December 31, 2014 for approximately $50.5 million, which settled or are scheduled to settle after December 31, 2014. We also received proceeds from sales and repayments of existing portfolio investments of approximately $96.3 million including $58.9 million in sales. Additionally, we had three investments under contract to sell as of December 31, 2014, for approximately $3.0 million, which represented the contract sales price. The combined result of which increased our portfolio, on a cost basis, by approximately $421.2 million, or 634.2%, and the number of portfolio investments by 43, or 65.0%, compared to the portfolio as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2014, the largest investment in an individual portfolio company represented approximately 3.1% of our portfolio's fair value with the remaining investments in an individual portfolio company ranging from 0.08% to 1.2%. The average single investment in our portfolio is approximately $4.3 million or 0.9% of the total portfolio. As a result of these transactions, our portfolio has become increasingly broadened across individual portfolio investments, geographic regions, and industries. Further, our total portfolio's investment composition (excluding our Other\nPortfolio investments) at fair value is comprised of 79.4% first lien debt securities, 18.0% second lien debt securities, with the remainder in unsecured debt investments and equity investments. First lien debt securities have priority over subordinated debt owed by the issuer with respect to the collateral pledged as security for the loan. Due to the relative priority of payment of first lien investments, these generally have lower yields than lower priority, less secured investments.\nSee - Portfolio Asset Quality\u201d for further discussion of the investment rating system. The result of the aforementioned transactions further diversified our geographic and industry concentrations and based upon our investment rating system, which is described further below, the weighted average rating of our LMM investments was approximately 2.6 and 3.0 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Lastly, the overall weighted average effective yield on our investment portfolio has increased from 8.3% at December 31, 2015 to 8.9% as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of both December 31, 2015 and 2014, the weighted average rating of our LMM investments was approximately 3.0. Lastly, the overall weighted average effective yield on our investment portfolio increased from 8.1% at December 31, 2014 to 8.3% as of December 31, 2015. For a discussion of calculation of effective yield, see Item 7.

One of the two portfolio companies on non-accrual status was in default due to failure to pay its outstanding principal balance of $2.9 million due upon the maturity of its two loans, while the other portfolio company on non-accrual status was in default due to failure to pay its required quarterly interest payments. Our Advisers are currently working with the borrowers to maximize recovery of the amounts borrowed. As of December 31, 2016, these three investments on non-accrual status comprised approximately 0.2% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and 0.8% of the total investment portfolio at cost. As of December 31, 2015, we had three investments in two portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status. These two investments on non-accrual status comprised approximately 0.4% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and 1.3% of the total investment portfolio at cost. For those investments in which S&P credit ratings are available, approximately 47.7% of the portfolio, the portfolio had a weighted average effective credit rating of B as of December 31, 2016.\nWe utilize a rating system developed by our Sub-Adviser to rate the performance of each LMM portfolio company.

The increase in interest income was primarily due to (i) the growth in our total portfolio resulting from the investment of additional equity capital raised and borrowings under the Credit Facilities, (ii) an increase in the amount of accretion of unearned income into interest income and (iii) an increase in our investment portfolio's weighted average annual effective yield. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average investment portfolio was $912.6 million, compared to $723.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we accreted approximately $11.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of unearned income into interest income. Finally, as of December 31, 2016 the portfolio had a weighted average annual effective yield on investments of approximately 8.9%, compared to 8.3% as of December 31, 2015. The increase in the weighted average annual effective yield is largely due to the additional investments in LMM and Private Loan companies during the year, which are higher yielding than the Middle Market investments. We believe further increases in investment income in future periods may arise due to (i) a growing base of portfolio company investments, and (ii) investments being held for the entire period relative to incremental net investment activity during each quarter.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, expenses, net of any fee and expense waivers, were approximately $37.8 million as compared to expenses of approximately $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in expenses was primarily due to (i) an increase in interest expense of $3.9 million, (ii) an increase in base management and incentive fees (net of fee waivers) of $3.6 million and (iii) commencing amortization of deferred offering costs to expense effective January 1, 2016 (see - Critical Accounting Policies - Organizational and Offering Costs). Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in the average borrowings during the period and an increase in our cost of borrowing on the Credit Facilities. Average borrowings were $396.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $305.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the annualized interest rate on borrowings was approximately 3.5% and 3.0%, respectively. Base management and incentive fees (net of fee waivers) increased primarily due to an increase in our average gross assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the base management and incentive fees, net of fee waivers, were approximately $19.2 million compared to a net fee of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no waivers of base management fees for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively; however, our Advisers waived the subordinated incentive fees on income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, totaling approximately $1.7 million and $2.6 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $66.6 million. The increase was attributable to unrealized appreciation on investments of approximately $38.2 million and net investment income of approximately $51.3 million, offset by net realized losses of approximately $22.9 million. The unrealized appreciation on investments in our portfolio was primarily driven by a recovery in the leveraged loan markets and the appreciation of our LMM and Private Loan equity investments. The net realized losses were primarily the result of (i) the realized loss of $20.3 million relating to the restructure of four Middle Market investments and (ii) the realized loss of $2.4 million relating to the exit of one Middle Market investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $7.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to unrealized depreciation on investments of approximately $38.0 million and realized losses of approximately $5.5 million, offset by net investment income of approximately $36.5 million. The unrealized depreciation on investments in our portfolio was primarily driven by the impact of broad price declines in the high yield bond and leveraged loan markets and the effect of declining oil prices on our investments in companies in the oil and gas sector. The realized losses were primarily driven by the Private Loan debt investment in Relativity Media, LLC that was converted into equity and warrants following a declaration of bankruptcy by the company. In conjunction with the conversion, we recognized a $5.5 million realized loss on the debt investment.\nRESULTS COMPARISONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nTotal Investment Income, Operating Expenses, Net Assets\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our total investment income was approximately $65.4 million and $19.2 million, respectively, consisting predominately of interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to (i) the growth in our total portfolio resulting from the investment of additional equity capital raised and borrowings under the Credit Facilities, (ii) an increase in the amount of accretion of unearned income into interest income and (iii) an increase in our investment portfolio's\nweighted average annual effective yield. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our average investment portfolio was $723.5 million, compared to $258.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we accreted approximately $4.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of unearned income into interest income. Finally, as of December 31, 2015, the portfolio had a weighted average annual effective yield on investments of approximately 8.3% compared to 8.1% as of December 31, 2014. The increase in yield is largely due to the additional investments in LMM and Private Loan companies during the year, which are higher yielding than the Middle Market investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, expenses, net of any fee and expense waivers and Expense Support Payments, were approximately $28.8 million as compared to expenses of approximately $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in expenses was primarily due to (i) an increase in base management and incentive fees (net of fee waivers) of $11.8 million and (ii) an increase in interest expense of approximately $7.8 million. Base management and incentive fees (net of fee waivers) increased primarily due to an increase in our average gross assets. Interest expense increased due to an increase in the average borrowings during the period. Average borrowings were $305.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, interest expense was higher for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the increase in amortization of deferred financing costs as a result of costs paid in connection with the Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the annualized interest rate on borrowings was approximately 3%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the base management and incentive fees, net of fee waivers, were approximately $11.8 million compared to a net fee of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our Adviser waived its base management fees in 2014 in an amount necessary for distributions declared to not represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No such waiver was necessary for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, our Advisers waived the subordinated incentive fee on income for the period October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, totaling approximately $451,000 and for year ended December 31, 2015, totaling approximately $2.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $7.0 million. The decrease was attributable to unrealized depreciation on investments of approximately $38.0 million and realized losses of approximately $5.5 million, offset by net investment income of approximately $36.5 million. The unrealized depreciation on investments in our portfolio was primarily driven by the impact of broad price declines in the high yield bond and leveraged loan markets and the effect of declining oil prices on our investments in companies in the oil and gas sector. The realized losses were primarily driven by the Private Loan debt investment in Relativity Media, LLC that was converted into equity and warrants following a declaration of bankruptcy by the company. In conjunction with the conversion, we recognized a $5.5 million realized loss on the debt investment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was approximately $3.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to unrealized depreciation on investments of approximately $14.2 million, offset by net investment income of approximately $11.2 million. The unrealized depreciation on investments in our portfolio was primarily driven by the decline in the fair value of two investments, in one portfolio company, which went into default after December 31, 2014, and the impact of broad price declines in the high yield bond and leveraged loan markets and the effect of declining oil prices on our investments in companies in the oil and gas sector.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $23.7 million in cash, which we held in various custodial accounts. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had $97.0 million in capacity available under the Credit Facilities. To seek to enhance our returns, we intend to continue to employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of our Adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See - Financing Arrangements.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 22 senior secured loan investments and three equity investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $42.7 million. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nWe currently generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of our Offering and the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan and from cash flows from fees, interest earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments.\nPrior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the net proceeds from our Offering, from the issuance of shares of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan and from sales and pay-downs of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.\nCash Flows\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.3 million. During that period, approximately $71.6 million of cash was used in our operating activities, which principally consisted of the purchase of new portfolio investments of $464.9 million, offset by the repayment of portfolio investments of $349.6 million and a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $66.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately $71.3 million was generated from financing activities, which principally consisted of $72.0 million in net offering proceeds received and a net $33.0 million increase in borrowings under the Credit Facilities, offset by $22.4 million in cash distributions paid to stockholders and $10.9 million in redemptions paid to stockholders.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.1 million. During that period, approximately $425.4 million of cash was used in our operating activities, which principally consisted of the purchase of new portfolio investments of $631.1 million and a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $7.0 million, offset by the repayment of portfolio debt investments of $176.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately $429.5 million was generated from financing activities, which principally consisted of $254.2 million in net offering proceeds received and a net $197.1 million increase in borrowings under the Credit Facilities , offset by $15.3 million in cash distributions paid to stockholders and $3.5 million paid for financing costs related to the Credit Facilities entered into during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $13.5 million. During that period, approximately $365.3 million of cash was used in our operating activities, which principally consisted of the purchase of new portfolio debt investments of $477.5 million and a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $3.0 million, offset by the repayment of portfolio debt investments of $96.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $378.8 million was generated from financing activities, which principally consisted of $217.9 million in net offering proceeds received and a net $168.9 million increase in borrowings under the Credit Facilities, offset by $5.1 million in cash distributions paid to stockholders and $2.7 million paid for financing costs related to the Credit Facilities entered into during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nContinuous Public Offering and Distribution Reinvestment Plan\nWe are engaged in a continuous public offering of our common stock. We accept subscriptions on a continuous basis and issue shares at weekly closings at prices that, after deducting selling commissions and Dealer Manager fees, must be above our NAV per share. Since commencing our Initial Offering through March 3, 2017, we have issued 75,147,989 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $706.6 million. On February 22, 2017, our board of directors, after determining that it would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders, decided to continue the Offering until September 30, 2017 and authorized the Closing to occur on or about September 30, 2017. However, our board of directors retained its right to provide final approval on the specific terms of the Closing, including its right to accelerate the Closing or to further continue the Offering if our board of directors determines that it is in the best interest of us and our stockholders to do so.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 12,387,347 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $105.4 million at an average price per share of $8.51. The gross proceeds received during the year ended December 31, 2016 include reinvested distributions of $24.8 million for which we issued 3,115,762 shares of common stock. The selling commissions and Dealer Manager fees related to the sale of our common stock were $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also incurred offering costs of $1.6 million related to the Offering, which consisted primarily of marketing expenses and legal, due diligence and printing fees.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we raised proceeds of $306.0 million from the Initial Offering, including proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan, and made payments of $25.7 million for selling commissions and Dealer Manager fees. We also incurred an obligation for $4.6 million of Initial Offering costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we raised proceeds of $253.1 million from the Initial Offering, including proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan, and made payments of $23.0 million for selling commissions and Dealer Manager fees. We also incurred an obligation for $3.8 million of Initial Offering costs.\nDistributions\nThe following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we declared on our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands except per share amounts).\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Distributions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Period Ended\n</td> <td>Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months ended March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 21, 2016, with the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions to our stockholders for the period of January 2017 through March 2017. These distributions have been, or will be, calculated based on stockholders of record each day from January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2017 in an amount equal to $0.00191781 per share, per day. Distributions are paid on the first business day following the completion of each month to which they relate.\nSpecific tax characteristics of all distributions are reported to stockholders shortly after the close of each calendar year on Form 1099-DIV. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, approximately 93.9%, 99.7% and 99.5% of the distributions paid were taxable to the investor as ordinary income and approximately 6.1%, 0.3% and 0.5% were treated as capital gain distributions for federal income tax purposes. No portion of the distributions paid during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 represented a return of capital.\nWe have adopted an opt in\u201d distribution reinvestment plan for our stockholders. As a result, if we make a distribution, our stockholders will receive distributions in cash unless they specifically opt in\u201d to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. We may, for the foreseeable future, pay a portion of our distributions from sources other than net realized income from operations, which may include stock offering proceeds, borrowings, fee and expense waivers from our Advisers and support payments from the Adviser.\nWe may fund our cash distributions from any sources of funds legally available, including stock offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and fee waivers from our Advisers. We have not established any limit on the extent to which we may use borrowings or stock offering proceeds to fund distributions. Our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the stock offering proceeds. As a result, a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe timing and amount of any future distributions to stockholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors.\nIn order to satisfy the Code's requirements applicable to entities subject to tax as a RIC, we must distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income on an annual basis. However, we may elect to spill over certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year, which may require us to pay a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on such excess undistributed taxable income. For the taxable years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, no portion of our undistributed income was subject to the 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax. For the taxable year ended December 31, 2015, we distributed $3.8 million, or $0.0615 per share, of our taxable income in 2016, prior to the filing of our U.S. federal income tax return for our 2015 taxable year. As a result, we were subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax of $119,000. In 2016, we distributed $7.3 million, or $0.099478 per share, of our taxable income in 2017, prior to the filing of our federal income tax return for our 2016 taxable year. As a result, we were subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax liability of approximately $246,000. In order to avoid the imposition of the 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax, we need to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.\nFinancing Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $23.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and our NAV totaled approximately $597.8 million equating to approximately $8.15 per share. The change from the December 31, 2015 NAV per share of $7.88 was largely due to the unrealized appreciation on investments in the portfolio. The unrealized appreciation on investments in our portfolio was primarily driven by a recovery in the high yield bond and leveraged loan markets in the last three quarters of the year.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $24.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and our NAV totaled approximately $491.7 million equating to approximately $7.88 per share. The change from the December 31, 2014 NAV per share of $8.40 was largely due to the unrealized depreciation on investments in the portfolio. The unrealized depreciation on investments in our portfolio was primarily driven by the broad price declines in the high yield bond and leveraged loan markets and by the effect of declining oil prices on our investments in the oil and gas sector.\nOn March 11, 2014, the Company entered into the Capital One Credit Facility, which as of December 31, 2016, had revolver commitments of $125.0 million, with an accordion provision allowing borrowing capacity to increase up to $150.0 million.\nOn June 2, 2014, HMS Funding, entered into the Deutsche Bank Credit Facility, which was most recently amended on February 9, 2016, increasing the revolver commitments to $385.0 million. The Company contributes certain assets to HMS Funding from time to time, as permitted under the Capital One Credit Facility, as collateral to secure the Deutsche Bank Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $80.0 million outstanding and $45.0 million available under our Capital One Credit Facility, and $333.0 million outstanding and $52.0 million available under the Deutsche Bank Credit Facility, both of which we estimated approximated fair value and subject to certain limitations and the asset coverage restrictions under the 1940 Act. As of December 31, 2015, we had $105.0 million outstanding and $20.0 million available under our Capital One Credit Facility, and $275.0 million outstanding and $85.0 million available under our Deutsche Bank Credit Facility, both of which we estimated approximated fair value and subject to certain limitations and the asset coverage restrictions under the 1940 Act. See Note 5 - Borrowings to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Credit Facilities.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash, capital raised from our Offering and borrowings on the Credit Facilities. Our primary uses of funds in both the short-term and long-term will be investments in portfolio companies, operating expenses and cash distributions to holders of our common stock.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with our Adviser, our Sub-Adviser and our Dealer Manager, whereby we pay certain fees and reimbursements to these entities. These include payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions and the Dealer Manager fee and payments to our Adviser for reimbursement of offering costs. In addition, we make payments for certain services that include the identification, execution, and management of our investments and also the management of our day-to-day operations provided to us by our Adviser and Sub-Adviser, pursuant to various agreements that we have entered into. See Note 10 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding related party transactions.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $413.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities. Unless extended, the Deutsche Bank Credit Facility will mature on June 16, 2020. As of December 31, 2016, the Capital One Credit Facility had a maturity date of March 11, 2017, with two one-year extension options, subject to lender approval. On March 6, 2017, the Capital One Credit Facility was amended and restated to, among other things, extend the maturity date to March 6, 2020. See above for a description of the Credit Facilities.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2016 is as follows:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period (dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital One Credit Facility (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deutsche Bank Credit Facility (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016, $45.0 million remained available under our Capital One Credit Facility; however, our borrowing ability is limited to the asset coverage ratio restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, as discussed above.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016, $52.0 million remained available under the Deutsche Bank Credit Facility; however, our borrowing ability is limited to the asset coverage ratio restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, as discussed above.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarified the implementation guidance regarding performance obligations and licensing arrangements. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which clarified guidance on assessing collectability, presenting sales tax, measuring non-cash consideration, and certain transition matters. The new guidance will be effective for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption would be permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We expect to identify similar performance obligations under ASC 606 as compared with deliverables and separate units of account previously identified. As a result, we expect the timing of our revenue recognition to remain the same.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810)-Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\u201d This guidance applies to entities in all industries and provides a new scope exception to registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds. This guidance also makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entities guidance. We adopted this standard during the three months ended March 31, 2016. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this new accounting standard.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which amends the required presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet. The guidance will require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the ASU No. 2015-03. For public business entities, the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements which clarified ASU 2015-03. This guidance allows an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize these deferred costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. We adopted this standard during the three months ended March 31, 2016. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this new accounting standard since the guidance allows us to continue to present our debt issuance costs for our line-of-credit arrangements as assets that are amortized over the term of the arrangements.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurements-Disclosures for Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share. This amendment updates guidance intended to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how investments measured at net asset value under the practical expedient with future redemption dates have been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. Under the updated guidance, investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share using\nthe practical expedient should no longer be categorized in the fair value hierarchy, while investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share but the practical expedient is not applied should continue to be categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The updated guidance requires retrospective adoption for all periods presented and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard during the three months ended March 31, 2016. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this new accounting standard as none of our investments are measured through the use of the practical expedient.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities which amends the guidance related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities. The guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU will also amend the guidance related to the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value and certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. For public companies, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\u201d which addresses eight specific cash flow issues including, among other things, the classification of debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and the interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),\u201d which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The amendment should be adopted retrospectively. The impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued standards and any that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2016, we had a total of approximately $42.7 million in outstanding commitments comprised of (i) 22 commitments to fund revolving loans that had not been fully drawn or term loans that had not been funded and (ii) three capital commitments that had not been fully called. We recognized unrealized depreciation of $266,000 on the outstanding unfunded loan commitments and unrealized appreciation of $14,000 on the outstanding unfunded capital commitments during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2015, we had a total of approximately $34.1 million in outstanding commitments comprised of (i) 14 commitments to fund revolving loans that had not been fully drawn or term loans that had not been funded and (ii) three capital commitments that had not been fully called. We recognized unrealized depreciation of $79,000 on our outstanding unfunded loan commitments and unrealized depreciation of $14,000 on our outstanding unfunded capital commitments during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commitments and Contingencies\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded Loan Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AccuMed Corp.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apex Linen Services, Inc.\n</td> <td>397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arcus Hunting, LLC\n</td> <td>2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BarFly Ventures, LLC\n</td> <td>881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buca C, LLC\n</td> <td>1,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CapFusion Holding, LLC\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CDHA Management, LLC\n</td> <td>3,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Datacom, LLC\n</td> <td>1,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gamber-Johnson Holdings, LLC\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guerdon Modular Holdings, Inc.\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hawk Ridge Systems, LLC\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hojeij Branded Foods, Inc.\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HW Temps LLC\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jackmont Hospitality, Inc.\n</td> <td>1,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LaMi Products, LLC\n</td> <td>1,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minute Key, Inc.\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mystic Logistics, Inc.\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pardus Oil & Gas, LLC\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Permian Holdco 2\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPC/Shift, LLC\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strike, LLC\n</td> <td>2,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unirush, LLC\n</td> <td>980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volusion, LLC\n</td> <td>2,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded Capital Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brightwood Capital Fund III, LP\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brightwood Capital Fund IV, LP\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EIG Traverse Co-Investment, LP\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freeport First Lien Loan Fund III, LP\n</td> <td>7,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Developments\nFrom January 1, 2017 through March 3, 2017, we raised approximately $19.5 million in the Offering including proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan of approximately $6.6 million. During this period, we funded approximately $34.2 million in investments and received proceeds from repayments and dispositions of approximately $94.4 million.\nOn January 12, 2017 and January 18, 2017, we increased our public offering price per share to $9.15 and $9.30, respectively, which was effective as of our weekly close on January 12, 2017 and January 19, 2017, respectively.\nOn February 3, 2017, we filed a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the SEC, to commence an offer by us to purchase, as approved by our board of directors, 1,700,749.42 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The offer is for cash at a purchase price equal to the NAV per share to be determined within 48 hours of the repurchase date.\nOn February 22, 2017, our board of directors, after determining that it would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders, decided to continue the Offering until September 30, 2017 and authorized the Closing to occur on or about September 30, 2017. However, our board of directors retained its right to provide final approval on the specific terms of the Closing, including its right to accelerate the Closing or to further continue the Offering if the board of directors determines that it is in the best interests of us and our stockholders to do so.\nOn March 6, 2017, we, together with HMS Equity Holding, HMS Equity Holding II, EverBank and certain financial institutions as lenders, amended and restated the Capital One Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date to March 6, 2020, (ii) reduce revolver commitments to $95.0 million and (iii) assign Capital One's role as administrative agent to EverBank.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nStatements we make in the following discussion which express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a specialty finance company sponsored by Hines that makes debt and equity investments in Middle Market and LMM companies. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We are, therefore, required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under the Code.\nOur primary investment objective is to generate current income through debt and equity investments. A secondary objective is to generate long-term capital appreciation through equity and equity-related investments including warrants, convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities. Our portfolio strategy calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by LMM companies and Middle Market companies in private placements and negotiated transactions, which are traded in private over-the-counter markets for institutional investors. We will also invest in, and a significant portion of our assets are invested in, customized direct secured and unsecured loans to and equity securities of LMM companies, referred to as LMM securities. Typically, our investments in LMM companies will require us to co-invest with Main Street and/or its affiliates. We categorize some of our investments in LMM companies and Middle Market companies as Private Loan portfolio investments. Private Loan investments, often referred to in the debt markets as club deals,\u201d are investments, generally in debt instruments, that we originate on a collaborative basis with other investment funds. Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our portfolio also includes Other Portfolio investments primarily consisting of investments managed by third parties, which differ from the typical profiles for our LMM portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments or Private Loan portfolio investments.\nAs a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments, including limitations on our ability to co-invest with certain affiliates, including Main Street. However, we received an order from the SEC that permits us, subject to certain conditions, to co-invest with Main Street in certain transactions originated by Main Street and/or our Advisers. The exemptive relief permits us, and certain of our directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries on one hand, and Main Street, and/or certain of its affiliates on the other hand, to co-invest in the same investment opportunities where such investment may otherwise be prohibited under Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may continue to co-invest with Main Street and/or its affiliates in syndicated deals and secondary loan market purchases in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance or interpretations where price is the only negotiated point.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had investments in 75 Middle Market debt investments, 29 Private Loan debt investments, 29 LMM debt investments, 28 LMM equity investments, nine Private Loan equity investments, five Middle Market equity investments and three Other Portfolio investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $989.2 million, a cost basis of approximately $1.0 billion, and a weighted average effective annual yield of approximately 8.9%. The weighted average annual yield was calculated using the effective interest rates for all investments at December 31, 2016, including accretion of original issue discount and amortization of the premium to par value, the amortization of fees received in connection with transactions, and assumes zero yield for investments on non-accrual status. Approximately 80.0% and 11.6% of our total portfolio investments (at fair value) were secured by first priority liens and second priority liens on portfolio company assets, respectively, with the remainder in unsecured debt investments and equity investments.\nThe level of new portfolio investment activity will fluctuate from period to period based upon the status of our capital raising efforts under the Offering, our view of the current economic fundamentals, our ability to identify new investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria and our ability to close on the identified transactions. The level of new investment activity and associated interest and fee income will directly impact future investment income. While we intend to grow our portfolio and our investment income over the long-term, our growth and our operating results may be more limited during depressed economic periods. However, we intend to appropriately manage our cost structure and liquidity position based on applicable economic conditions and our investment outlook. The level of realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation will also\nfluctuate depending upon portfolio activity and the performance of our individual portfolio companies. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results.\nInvestment Income\nWe have generated, and plan to continue to generate, investment income primarily in the form of interest on the debt securities that we hold, dividends and other distributions with respect to any equity interests that we hold and capital gains, if any, on convertible debt or other equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. All such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned or as additional yield over the life of the debt investment. To date our investment income has been interest income on debt investments, accretion of original issue discounts, dividend income, amortization of premiums and fees received from transactions and net realized/unrealized appreciation (depreciation).\nExpenses\nOn both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to our stockholders. Our primary operating expenses will be debt service payments, general and administrative expenses and payment of advisory fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The investment advisory fees paid to our Adviser (and the fees paid by our Adviser to our Sub-Adviser pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement) will compensate our Advisers for their work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. We expect our expenses to fluctuate based upon the amount of assets under management.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including fees and expenses relating to:\n \u2022 corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to certain limitations; \n \u2022 the cost of calculating our NAV, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchase of shares of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, monitoring our financial and legal affairs, making investments, and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments; \n \u2022 interest payable on debt, if any, including any hedging costs; \n \u2022 investment advisory fees; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses, including travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of director and stockholder meetings, proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices; \n \u2022 cost of fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs such as printing of stockholder reports and advertising or sales materials, mailing, long distance telephone, and staff; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the 1940 Act, and other applicable federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 brokerage commissions for our investments; \n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by our Advisers in performing their obligations, subject to the limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement; and \n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by us or any administrator in connection with administering our business, including payments under any administration agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by any administrator in performing its obligations under any proposed administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. \nDuring periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines.\nBase Management and Incentive Fee, Administrative Services Expense Waiver and Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement\nFrom time to time, our Advisers may waive certain fees accrued under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Sub-Advisory Agreement, as applicable, and our Adviser may pay to us Expense Support Payments. We may reimburse such waived fees and Expense Support Payments within three years from the date of each respective fee waiver and from the date that each respective Expense Support Payment was determined. See Note 10 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information on our fee waivers and expense reimbursements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Under the 1940 Act rules, regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X and Topic 946 of the Accounting Standards Codification, as amended (the ASC\u201d), of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), Financial Accounting Services-Investment Companies, we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest, unless the portfolio company is a wholly-owned investment company. An exception to this general principle occurs if we own a controlled operating company whose purpose is to provide services to us such as an investment adviser or transfer agent. None of our investments qualifies for this exception. Therefore, our portfolio company investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes to fair value recognized as Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations until the investment is realized, usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss on exit being recognized as a realized gain or loss. However, in the event that any controlled subsidiary exceeds the tests of significance set forth in Rules 3-09 or 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, we will include required financial information for such subsidiary in the notes or as an attachment to our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Classification\nWe classify our investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, (a) Control\u201d investments are defined as investments in companies in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities or has rights to nominate greater than 50% of the directors or managers of the entity, (b) Affiliate\u201d investments are defined as investments in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned, or an investment in an investment company's investment adviser, and the investments are not classified as Control investments and (c) Non-Control/Non-Affiliate\u201d investments are defined as investments that are neither Control investments nor Affiliated investments.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe account for our portfolio investments at fair value under the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.\nOur portfolio strategy calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by private, LMM companies and debt securities issued by Middle Market companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies. We categorize some of our investments in LMM companies and Middle Market companies as Private Loan portfolio investments. Private Loan investments, often referred to in the debt markets as club deals,\u201d are investments, generally in debt instruments, that we originate on a collaborative basis with other investment funds or lenders. Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to the investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our portfolio also includes Other Portfolio investments primarily consisting of investments managed by third parties, which differ from the typical profiles for our LMM portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments or Private Loan portfolio investments. Our portfolio\ninvestments may be subject to restrictions on resale. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Investments - The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\u201d\nLMM investments and Other Portfolio investments generally have no established trading market while Middle Market securities generally have established markets that are not active. Private Loan investments may include investments which have no established trading market or have established markets that are not active. We determine in good faith the fair value of our investment portfolio pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with ASC 820 and a valuation process approved by our board of directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act. Our valuation policies and processes are intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio.\nFor LMM portfolio investments, we generally review external events, including private mergers, sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies, and includes these events in the valuation process by using an enterprise value waterfall ( Waterfall\u201d) for our LMM equity investments and an income approach using a yield-to-maturity model ( Yield-to-Maturity\u201d) for our LMM debt investments. For Middle Market portfolio investments, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in the valuation process. We determine the appropriateness of the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer, the depth and consistency of broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance of the portfolio company and other market indices. We often cannot observe the inputs considered by the third party in determining their quotes. For Middle Market and Private Loan portfolio investments in debt securities for which it has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, we generally estimate the fair value based on the assumptions that we believe hypothetical market participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method. For our Other Portfolio equity investments, we generally calculate the fair value of the investment primarily based on the NAV of the fund. All of the valuation approaches for our portfolio investments estimate the value of the investment as if we were to sell, or exit, the investment as of the measurement date.\nUnder the Waterfall valuation method, we estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company using a combination of market and income approaches or other appropriate valuation methods, such as considering recent transactions in the equity securities of the portfolio company or third-party valuations of the portfolio company, and then perform a Waterfall calculation by using the enterprise value over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another. The enterprise value is the fair value at which an enterprise could be sold in a transaction between two willing parties, rather than through a forced or liquidation sale. Typically, private companies are bought and sold based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. There is no single methodology for estimating enterprise value. For any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally described as a range of values from which a single estimate of enterprise value is derived. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyze various factors including the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results. The operating results of a portfolio company may include unaudited, projected, budgeted or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for non-recurring items or to normalize the operating results that may require significant judgment in its determination. In addition, projecting future financial results requires significant judgment regarding future growth assumptions. In evaluating the operating results, we also analyze the impact of exposure to litigation, loss of customers or other contingencies. After determining the appropriate enterprise value, we allocate the enterprise value to investments in order of the legal priority of the various components of the portfolio company's capital structure. In applying the Waterfall valuation method, we assume the loans are paid off at the principal amount in a change in control transaction and are not assumed by the buyer, which we believe is consistent with our past transaction history and standard industry practices.\nUnder the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method, we also use the income approach to determine the fair value of debt securities based on projections of the discounted future free cash flows that the debt security will likely generate, including analyzing the discounted cash flows of interest and principal amounts for the debt security, as set forth in the associated loan agreements, as well as the financial position and credit risk of the portfolio investments. We estimate the expected repayment date of our debt securities is generally the legal maturity date of the instrument, as we generally intend to hold our loans and debt securities to maturity. The Yield-to-Maturity analysis also considers changes in leverage levels, credit quality, portfolio company performance and other factors. We will generally use the value determined by the Yield-to-Maturity analysis as the fair value for that security. However, it is our position that assuming a borrower is outperforming underwriting expectations and because these respective investments do not generally contain pre-payment penalties, the borrower would most likely prepay or refinance the borrowing if the market interest rate, given the borrower's credit quality, is lower than the stated loan interest rate. Therefore, we do not believe that a market participant would pay a premium for the investment, and because of our general intent to hold its loans to maturity, we generally do not believe that the fair value of the investment should be adjusted in excess of the face amount. A change in the assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our debt securities using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method could have a material impact on the determination of fair value. If there is deterioration in credit quality or if a debt security is in workout status, we may consider other factors in determining the fair value of the debt security, including the value attributable\nto the debt security from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would most likely be received in a liquidation analysis.\nUnder the NAV valuation method, for an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, we measure the fair value of the investment predominately based on the NAV of the investment fund as of the measurement date. However, in determining the fair value of the investment, we may consider whether adjustments to the NAV are necessary in certain circumstances, based on the analysis of any restrictions on redemption of our investment as of the measurement date, recent actual sales or redemptions of interests in the investment fund, and expected future cash flows available to equity holders, including the rate of return on those cash flows compared to an implied market return on equity required by market participants, or other uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize the full NAV of our interests in the investment fund.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors will undertake a multi-step valuation process, as described below:\n \u2022 Our valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by investment professionals of our Advisers responsible for credit monitoring. \n \u2022 Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and our Advisers. \n \u2022 Our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. \n \u2022 For our LMM portfolio companies and certain Private Loan portfolio companies, we have valuations reviewed by an independent valuation firm on a periodic basis. \n \u2022 Our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith. \nPursuant to our internal valuation process and the requirements under the 1940 Act, we perform valuation procedures on our unquoted investments in LMM portfolio companies and certain Private Loan portfolio companies (the Internally Valued Investments\u201d) at least once a quarter. Among other things, we generally consult with a nationally recognized independent valuation firm on the Internally Valued Investments at least once in every calendar year, and for new Internally Valued Investments, at least once in the twelve-month period subsequent to the initial investment. In certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in our stockholders' best interest, to consult with the nationally recognized independent valuation firm on our investments in one or more of these Internally Valued Investments. Such instances include situations where the fair value of our investment is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we consulted with our independent valuation firm in arriving at our determination of fair value on our investments in a total of 21 of the 23 LMM portfolio companies and in a total of 15 of the 29 Private Loan portfolio companies. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we consulted with our independent valuation firm in arriving at our determination of fair value on our investments in a total of 11 of the 16 LMM portfolio companies and in a total of seven of the 20 Private Loan portfolio companies.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our estimate of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We estimate the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest, Fee and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Prepayment penalties received by us are recorded as income upon receipt. Dividend income is recorded when dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Accrued interest and dividend income are evaluated quarterly for collectability. When a debt security becomes 90 days or more past due and we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, the debt security will generally be placed on non-accrual status, and we will cease recognizing interest income on that debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any previously accrued interest, then the interest income will be written off. Additionally, if a debt security has deferred interest payment terms and we become aware of a deterioration in the credit quality, we will evaluate the collectability of the deferred interest payment. If it is determined that the deferred interest is unlikely to be collected, we will place the security on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay the contractual amounts due. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. If a debt security's status significantly improves with respect to the debtor's ability to service the debt or other obligations, or if a debt security is fully impaired, sold or written off, it will be removed from non-accrual status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had five debt investments in four portfolio companies that were more than 90 days past due (two of which were in the oil and gas industry), including three debt investments in two portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status. Each of these portfolio companies experienced a significant decline in credit quality raising doubt regarding our ability to collect the principal and interest contractually due. Given the credit deterioration,we ceased accruing interest income on the non-accrual debt investments and wrote off any previously accrued interest deemed uncollectable. There was no allowance recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016. Aside from these three investments on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2016, we are not aware of any material changes to the creditworthiness of the borrowers underlying its debt investments.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had three debt investments in two portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status including two debt investments in one portfolio company that were more than 90 days past due. Each of these portfolio companies experienced a significant decline in credit quality raising doubt regarding our ability to collect the principal and interest contractually due. Given the credit deterioration, we have recognized no interest income on two of the three non-accrual debt investments during the year ended December 31, 2015. For the other non-accrual debt investment, an allowance of $196,000 was booked for the interest income recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2015.\nFrom time to time, we may hold debt instruments in our investment portfolio that contain a PIK interest provision. If these borrowers elect to pay or are obligated to pay interest under the optional PIK provision, and, if deemed collectible, then the interest would be computed at the contractual rate specified in the investment's credit agreement, recorded as interest income and periodically added to the principal balance of the investment. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. We stop accruing PIK interest and write off any accrued and uncollected interest in arrears when we determine that such PIK interest in arrears is no longer collectible.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015 we held 19 and seven investments, respectively, which contained a PIK provision. As discussed above, two of the 19 investments with PIK provisions as of December 31, 2016 and two of the seven investments with PIK provisions as of December 31, 2015 were on non-accrual status. No PIK interest was recorded on these investments during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized approximately $469,000, $1.2 million and $274,000, respectively, of PIK interest. We stop accruing PIK interest and write off any accrued and uncollected interest in arrears when we determine that such PIK interest in arrears is no longer collectible.\nWe may periodically provide services, including structuring and advisory services, to our portfolio companies or other third parties. The income from such services is non-recurring. For services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value, income is recognized as earned, which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes. Fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are deferred and accreted into interest income over the life of the financing.\nA presentation of the investment income we received from our investment portfolio in each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands) is as follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nStatements we make in the following discussion which express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a specialty finance company sponsored by Hines that makes debt and equity investments in Middle Market and LMM companies. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We are, therefore, required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under the Code.\nOur primary investment objective is to generate current income through debt and equity investments. A secondary objective is to generate long-term capital appreciation through equity and equity-related investments including warrants, convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities. Our portfolio strategy calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by LMM companies and Middle Market companies in private placements and negotiated transactions, which are traded in private over-the-counter markets for institutional investors. We will also invest in, and a significant portion of our assets are invested in, customized direct secured and unsecured loans to and equity securities of LMM companies, referred to as LMM securities. Typically, our investments in LMM companies will require us to co-invest with Main Street and/or its affiliates. We categorize some of our investments in LMM companies and Middle Market companies as Private Loan portfolio investments. Private Loan investments, often referred to in the debt markets as club deals,\u201d are investments, generally in debt instruments, that we originate on a collaborative basis with other investment funds. Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our portfolio also includes Other Portfolio investments primarily consisting of investments managed by third parties, which differ from the typical profiles for our LMM portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments or Private Loan portfolio investments.\nAs a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments, including limitations on our ability to co-invest with certain affiliates, including Main Street. However, we received an order from the SEC that permits us, subject to certain conditions, to co-invest with Main Street in certain transactions originated by Main Street and/or our Advisers. The exemptive relief permits us, and certain of our directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries on one hand, and Main Street, and/or certain of its affiliates on the other hand, to co-invest in the same investment opportunities where such investment may otherwise be prohibited under Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may continue to co-invest with Main Street and/or its affiliates in syndicated deals and secondary loan market purchases in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance or interpretations where price is the only negotiated point.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had investments in 75 Middle Market debt investments, 29 Private Loan debt investments, 29 LMM debt investments, 28 LMM equity investments, nine Private Loan equity investments, five Middle Market equity investments and three Other Portfolio investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $989.2 million, a cost basis of approximately $1.0 billion, and a weighted average effective annual yield of approximately 8.9%. The weighted average annual yield was calculated using the effective interest rates for all investments at December 31, 2016, including accretion of original issue discount and amortization of the premium to par value, the amortization of fees received in connection with transactions, and assumes zero yield for investments on non-accrual status. Approximately 80.0% and 11.6% of our total portfolio investments (at fair value) were secured by first priority liens and second priority liens on portfolio company assets, respectively, with the remainder in unsecured debt investments and equity investments.\nThe level of new portfolio investment activity will fluctuate from period to period based upon the status of our capital raising efforts under the Offering, our view of the current economic fundamentals, our ability to identify new investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria and our ability to close on the identified transactions. The level of new investment activity and associated interest and fee income will directly impact future investment income. While we intend to grow our portfolio and our investment income over the long-term, our growth and our operating results may be more limited during depressed economic periods. However, we intend to appropriately manage our cost structure and liquidity position based on applicable economic conditions and our investment outlook. The level of realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation will also\nfluctuate depending upon portfolio activity and the performance of our individual portfolio companies. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results.\nInvestment Income\nWe have generated, and plan to continue to generate, investment income primarily in the form of interest on the debt securities that we hold, dividends and other distributions with respect to any equity interests that we hold and capital gains, if any, on convertible debt or other equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. All such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned or as additional yield over the life of the debt investment. To date our investment income has been interest income on debt investments, accretion of original issue discounts, dividend income, amortization of premiums and fees received from transactions and net realized/unrealized appreciation (depreciation).\nExpenses\nOn both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to our stockholders. Our primary operating expenses will be debt service payments, general and administrative expenses and payment of advisory fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The investment advisory fees paid to our Adviser (and the fees paid by our Adviser to our Sub-Adviser pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement) will compensate our Advisers for their work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. We expect our expenses to fluctuate based upon the amount of assets under management.\nWe bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including fees and expenses relating to:\n \u2022 corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to certain limitations; \n \u2022 the cost of calculating our NAV, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchase of shares of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, monitoring our financial and legal affairs, making investments, and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments; \n \u2022 interest payable on debt, if any, including any hedging costs; \n \u2022 investment advisory fees; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees; \n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses, including travel expenses; \n \u2022 costs of director and stockholder meetings, proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices; \n \u2022 cost of fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 direct costs such as printing of stockholder reports and advertising or sales materials, mailing, long distance telephone, and staff; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the 1940 Act, and other applicable federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 brokerage commissions for our investments; \n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by our Advisers in performing their obligations, subject to the limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement; and \n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by us or any administrator in connection with administering our business, including payments under any administration agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by any administrator in performing its obligations under any proposed administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. \nDuring periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines.\nBase Management and Incentive Fee, Administrative Services Expense Waiver and Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement\nFrom time to time, our Advisers may waive certain fees accrued under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Sub-Advisory Agreement, as applicable, and our Adviser may pay to us Expense Support Payments. We may reimburse such waived fees and Expense Support Payments within three years from the date of each respective fee waiver and from the date that each respective Expense Support Payment was determined. See Note 10 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information on our fee waivers and expense reimbursements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Under the 1940 Act rules, regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X and Topic 946 of the Accounting Standards Codification, as amended (the ASC\u201d), of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), Financial Accounting Services-Investment Companies, we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest, unless the portfolio company is a wholly-owned investment company. An exception to this general principle occurs if we own a controlled operating company whose purpose is to provide services to us such as an investment adviser or transfer agent. None of our investments qualifies for this exception. Therefore, our portfolio company investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes to fair value recognized as Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations until the investment is realized, usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss on exit being recognized as a realized gain or loss. However, in the event that any controlled subsidiary exceeds the tests of significance set forth in Rules 3-09 or 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, we will include required financial information for such subsidiary in the notes or as an attachment to our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Classification\nWe classify our investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, (a) Control\u201d investments are defined as investments in companies in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities or has rights to nominate greater than 50% of the directors or managers of the entity, (b) Affiliate\u201d investments are defined as investments in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned, or an investment in an investment company's investment adviser, and the investments are not classified as Control investments and (c) Non-Control/Non-Affiliate\u201d investments are defined as investments that are neither Control investments nor Affiliated investments.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe account for our portfolio investments at fair value under the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.\nOur portfolio strategy calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by private, LMM companies and debt securities issued by Middle Market companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies. We categorize some of our investments in LMM companies and Middle Market companies as Private Loan portfolio investments. Private Loan investments, often referred to in the debt markets as club deals,\u201d are investments, generally in debt instruments, that we originate on a collaborative basis with other investment funds or lenders. Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to the investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our portfolio also includes Other Portfolio investments primarily consisting of investments managed by third parties, which differ from the typical profiles for our LMM portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments or Private Loan portfolio investments. Our portfolio\ninvestments may be subject to restrictions on resale. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Investments - The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\u201d\nLMM investments and Other Portfolio investments generally have no established trading market while Middle Market securities generally have established markets that are not active. Private Loan investments may include investments which have no established trading market or have established markets that are not active. We determine in good faith the fair value of our investment portfolio pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with ASC 820 and a valuation process approved by our board of directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act. Our valuation policies and processes are intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio.\nFor LMM portfolio investments, we generally review external events, including private mergers, sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies, and includes these events in the valuation process by using an enterprise value waterfall ( Waterfall\u201d) for our LMM equity investments and an income approach using a yield-to-maturity model ( Yield-to-Maturity\u201d) for our LMM debt investments. For Middle Market portfolio investments, we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in the valuation process. We determine the appropriateness of the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer, the depth and consistency of broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance of the portfolio company and other market indices. We often cannot observe the inputs considered by the third party in determining their quotes. For Middle Market and Private Loan portfolio investments in debt securities for which it has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, we generally estimate the fair value based on the assumptions that we believe hypothetical market participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method. For our Other Portfolio equity investments, we generally calculate the fair value of the investment primarily based on the NAV of the fund. All of the valuation approaches for our portfolio investments estimate the value of the investment as if we were to sell, or exit, the investment as of the measurement date.\nUnder the Waterfall valuation method, we estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company using a combination of market and income approaches or other appropriate valuation methods, such as considering recent transactions in the equity securities of the portfolio company or third-party valuations of the portfolio company, and then perform a Waterfall calculation by using the enterprise value over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another. The enterprise value is the fair value at which an enterprise could be sold in a transaction between two willing parties, rather than through a forced or liquidation sale. Typically, private companies are bought and sold based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. There is no single methodology for estimating enterprise value. For any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally described as a range of values from which a single estimate of enterprise value is derived. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyze various factors including the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results. The operating results of a portfolio company may include unaudited, projected, budgeted or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for non-recurring items or to normalize the operating results that may require significant judgment in its determination. In addition, projecting future financial results requires significant judgment regarding future growth assumptions. In evaluating the operating results, we also analyze the impact of exposure to litigation, loss of customers or other contingencies. After determining the appropriate enterprise value, we allocate the enterprise value to investments in order of the legal priority of the various components of the portfolio company's capital structure. In applying the Waterfall valuation method, we assume the loans are paid off at the principal amount in a change in control transaction and are not assumed by the buyer, which we believe is consistent with our past transaction history and standard industry practices.\nUnder the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method, we also use the income approach to determine the fair value of debt securities based on projections of the discounted future free cash flows that the debt security will likely generate, including analyzing the discounted cash flows of interest and principal amounts for the debt security, as set forth in the associated loan agreements, as well as the financial position and credit risk of the portfolio investments. We estimate the expected repayment date of our debt securities is generally the legal maturity date of the instrument, as we generally intend to hold our loans and debt securities to maturity. The Yield-to-Maturity analysis also considers changes in leverage levels, credit quality, portfolio company performance and other factors. We will generally use the value determined by the Yield-to-Maturity analysis as the fair value for that security. However, it is our position that assuming a borrower is outperforming underwriting expectations and because these respective investments do not generally contain pre-payment penalties, the borrower would most likely prepay or refinance the borrowing if the market interest rate, given the borrower's credit quality, is lower than the stated loan interest rate. Therefore, we do not believe that a market participant would pay a premium for the investment, and because of our general intent to hold its loans to maturity, we generally do not believe that the fair value of the investment should be adjusted in excess of the face amount. A change in the assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our debt securities using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method could have a material impact on the determination of fair value. If there is deterioration in credit quality or if a debt security is in workout status, we may consider other factors in determining the fair value of the debt security, including the value attributable\nto the debt security from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would most likely be received in a liquidation analysis.\nUnder the NAV valuation method, for an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, we measure the fair value of the investment predominately based on the NAV of the investment fund as of the measurement date. However, in determining the fair value of the investment, we may consider whether adjustments to the NAV are necessary in certain circumstances, based on the analysis of any restrictions on redemption of our investment as of the measurement date, recent actual sales or redemptions of interests in the investment fund, and expected future cash flows available to equity holders, including the rate of return on those cash flows compared to an implied market return on equity required by market participants, or other uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize the full NAV of our interests in the investment fund.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors will undertake a multi-step valuation process, as described below:\n \u2022 Our valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by investment professionals of our Advisers responsible for credit monitoring. \n \u2022 Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and our Advisers. \n \u2022 Our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. \n \u2022 For our LMM portfolio companies and certain Private Loan portfolio companies, we have valuations reviewed by an independent valuation firm on a periodic basis. \n \u2022 Our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith. \nPursuant to our internal valuation process and the requirements under the 1940 Act, we perform valuation procedures on our unquoted investments in LMM portfolio companies and certain Private Loan portfolio companies (the Internally Valued Investments\u201d) at least once a quarter. Among other things, we generally consult with a nationally recognized independent valuation firm on the Internally Valued Investments at least once in every calendar year, and for new Internally Valued Investments, at least once in the twelve-month period subsequent to the initial investment. In certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in our stockholders' best interest, to consult with the nationally recognized independent valuation firm on our investments in one or more of these Internally Valued Investments. Such instances include situations where the fair value of our investment is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we consulted with our independent valuation firm in arriving at our determination of fair value on our investments in a total of 21 of the 23 LMM portfolio companies and in a total of 15 of the 29 Private Loan portfolio companies. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we consulted with our independent valuation firm in arriving at our determination of fair value on our investments in a total of 11 of the 16 LMM portfolio companies and in a total of seven of the 20 Private Loan portfolio companies.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our estimate of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We estimate the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest, Fee and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Prepayment penalties received by us are recorded as income upon receipt. Dividend income is recorded when dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Accrued interest and dividend income are evaluated quarterly for collectability. When a debt security becomes 90 days or more past due and we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, the debt security will generally be placed on non-accrual status, and we will cease recognizing interest income on that debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any previously accrued interest, then the interest income will be written off. Additionally, if a debt security has deferred interest payment terms and we become aware of a deterioration in the credit quality, we will evaluate the collectability of the deferred interest payment. If it is determined that the deferred interest is unlikely to be collected, we will place the security on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay the contractual amounts due. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. If a debt security's status significantly improves with respect to the debtor's ability to service the debt or other obligations, or if a debt security is fully impaired, sold or written off, it will be removed from non-accrual status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had five debt investments in four portfolio companies that were more than 90 days past due (two of which were in the oil and gas industry), including three debt investments in two portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status. Each of these portfolio companies experienced a significant decline in credit quality raising doubt regarding our ability to collect the principal and interest contractually due. Given the credit deterioration,we ceased accruing interest income on the non-accrual debt investments and wrote off any previously accrued interest deemed uncollectable. There was no allowance recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016. Aside from these three investments on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2016, we are not aware of any material changes to the creditworthiness of the borrowers underlying its debt investments.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had three debt investments in two portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status including two debt investments in one portfolio company that were more than 90 days past due. Each of these portfolio companies experienced a significant decline in credit quality raising doubt regarding our ability to collect the principal and interest contractually due. Given the credit deterioration, we have recognized no interest income on two of the three non-accrual debt investments during the year ended December 31, 2015. For the other non-accrual debt investment, an allowance of $196,000 was booked for the interest income recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2015.\nFrom time to time, we may hold debt instruments in our investment portfolio that contain a PIK interest provision. If these borrowers elect to pay or are obligated to pay interest under the optional PIK provision, and, if deemed collectible, then the interest would be computed at the contractual rate specified in the investment's credit agreement, recorded as interest income and periodically added to the principal balance of the investment. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. We stop accruing PIK interest and write off any accrued and uncollected interest in arrears when we determine that such PIK interest in arrears is no longer collectible.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015 we held 19 and seven investments, respectively, which contained a PIK provision. As discussed above, two of the 19 investments with PIK provisions as of December 31, 2016 and two of the seven investments with PIK provisions as of December 31, 2015 were on non-accrual status. No PIK interest was recorded on these investments during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized approximately $469,000, $1.2 million and $274,000, respectively, of PIK interest. We stop accruing PIK interest and write off any accrued and uncollected interest in arrears when we determine that such PIK interest in arrears is no longer collectible.\nWe may periodically provide services, including structuring and advisory services, to our portfolio companies or other third parties. The income from such services is non-recurring. For services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value, income is recognized as earned, which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes. Fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are deferred and accreted into interest income over the life of the financing.\nA presentation of the investment income we received from our investment portfolio in each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands) is as follows:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest, Fee and Dividend Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest"}
