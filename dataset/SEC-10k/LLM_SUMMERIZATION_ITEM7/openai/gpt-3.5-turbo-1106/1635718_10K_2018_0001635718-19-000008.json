MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCertain factors affecting forward-looking statements\nCertain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain certain forward-looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance, and other matters. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. The words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"seek,\" \"anticipate,\" \"project,\" and similar expressions, among others, generally identify \"forward-looking statements\" which speak only as of the date the statements were made and are not guarantees of future performance. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, trends, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied in the forward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of our management, is expressed in good faith, and is believed to have a reasonable basis. However, there can be no assurance the expectation or belief will result, be achieved, or be accomplished. Whether or not any such forward-looking statements are in fact achieved will depend on future events, some of which are beyond our control. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to modify or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances occurring after the date of this report. Factors, risks, trends, and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied include the matters described above under

summary\nGannett is a media and marketing solutions company whose wide variety of digital content reaches 126 million unique visitors a month. The company has many relevant digital products, including web sites, mobile platforms, and apps affiliated with its local and international brands. The company also comprises 110 daily U.S. print products, including USA TODAY, and 150 publications in the U.K. Total U.S. daily print and digital circulation averages 3 million, rising to 5 million on Sundays. In the U.K., weekly print circulation averages approximately 8.0 million.\nThe scope of marketing solutions products and services Gannett provides businesses through its ReachLocal segment ranges from search and social media advertising, data insights, websites, local listings, and search engine optimization to mobile, social, video, live chats, lead engagement, and automation. Our operations also include commercial printing.\nBasis of reporting\nThe following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our accounting for or reporting on the business over the last three fiscal years. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, selected financial data, and the remainder of this Form 10-K.\nFiscal year: Starting in 2018, our fiscal year coincides with the Gregorian calendar. In 2017 and prior, our fiscal years ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. Our fiscal year for 2018 was a 52-week year ending on December 31, 2018. Fiscal year 2017 was a 53-week year ending on December 31, 2017, and fiscal year 2016 was a 52-week year ending on December 25, 2016.\nAdvertising and marketing services revenues: In 2018, we realigned the presentation of web presence and software-as-a-service revenues from other revenues to advertising and marketing services revenues on the Consolidated statements of income. As a result of this updated presentation, advertising and marketing services revenues increased and other revenues decreased $46.2 million, $34.6 million, and $9.2 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Operating revenues, net income, retained earnings, and earnings per share remained unchanged.\nCertain matters affecting current and future operating results\nThe following developments affect period-over-period comparisons and will affect period-over-period comparisons for future results:\nAcquisitions\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>WordStream, Inc. (WordStream) - In July 2018, our ReachLocal segment completed the acquisition of WordStream, a provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service solutions for local and regional businesses and agencies, for approximately $132.5 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, up to $20.0 million of additional consideration is payable in 2019 and 2020 based upon the achievement of certain revenue targets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SweetIQ Analytics Corp.

In addition, we have engaged in facility consolidation initiatives which include the disposition of older, under-utilized buildings, relocations to more efficient, flexible, digitally-oriented office spaces, efforts to reconfigure spaces to take advantage of leasing and subleasing opportunities, and the combination of production and distribution operations where possible. These facility consolidation and other cost savings plans led us to recognize severance charges, asset impairment charges, shutdown costs, and charges associated with reducing the useful lives of certain assets. As part of our plans, we are selling certain assets which we have classified as held-for-sale and reduced carrying values to equal fair value less costs to dispose. In addition, we had impairments of intangible assets which were principally a result of cash flow projections which were lower than expected.\nIn conjunction with these programs, we incurred restructuring costs of $67.9 million in 2018, $44.3 million in 2017, and $45.8 million in 2016. Included in these restructuring costs are severance costs of $51.1 million in 2018, $37.0 million in 2017, and $43.5 million in 2016. In 2018, we offered an early retirement opportunity program (EROP) for certain employees in our Domestic Publishing and Corporate units for which $27.8 million of severance costs were incurred and are included in the severance costs above.\nWe recorded asset impairment charges of $50.5 million in 2018, $46.8 million in 2017, and $55.9 million in 2016. We also recorded accelerated depreciation of $16.7 million in 2018, $44.0 million in 2017, and $3.2 million in 2016.\nForeign currency\nOur U.K. publishing operations are conducted through our Newsquest subsidiary. In addition, ReachLocal has foreign operations in regions such as Asia-Pacific and South America. Our earnings from operations in foreign regions are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.\nWith respect to Newsquest, the average exchange rate used to translate U.K. results was 1.33 for 2018, 1.29 for 2017, and 1.36 for 2016. Translation fluctuations impact our U.K. revenue, expense, and operating income results. The 4% increase in the exchange rate from 2017 to 2018 favorably impacted 2018 revenue comparisons by approximately $10.5 million. The 5% decrease in the exchange rate from 2016 to 2017 unfavorably impacted 2017 revenue comparisons by approximately $16.1 million.\nImpacts stemming from foreign currency translation gains and losses at our ReachLocal segment unfavorably impacted revenue by $3.8 million in 2018. In 2017 and 2016, foreign currency translation gains and losses were immaterial.\nNewsprint supply\nThe newsprint supply available to U.S. publishers is volatile. In 2017, North American newsprint producers permanently removed production capacity approaching one million metric tonnes per year, and similar production capacity reductions were witnessed outside of North America. In addition, in the first six months of 2018, many Canadian producers were subjected to significant anti-dumping and countervailing duties upon importation of newsprint into the U.S. Those duties were ultimately eliminated by the International Trade Commission in September 2018, but their imposition in the first half of 2018 disrupted the newsprint market by driving prices higher and incentivizing Canadian producers to reduce their shipments of newsprint into the United States.\nAs a result of the above, newsprint prices remained elevated throughout 2018; however, newsprint expense at our publishing segment was effectively flat in 2018 as rising prices were offset by declines in circulation volumes and usage.\nOutlook for 2019\nAs we move into 2019, we remain focused on executing our strategic vision of being essential to consumers and marketers seeking meaningful connections with their communities across print, digital, and other channels. In 2018, we completed our organizational realignment that reorganized our business into two functions - Marketing Solutions and Consumer. In our Marketing Solutions business, we are focused on developing a more comprehensive suite of marketing products and services, including the integration of the recent WordStream acquisition. Although print advertising will remain challenged due to market pressures, we are aggressively focused on driving a deeper penetration of our digital advertising and marketing service products within our local client base as well as acquiring new clients. Our Consumer organization is focused on growing our audiences and deepening engagement, in part by expanding our spectrum of content beyond traditional news into new verticals and platforms. We will continue to strive to maximize operational excellence by working to maximize the efficiency of our print, sales, administrative, and distribution functions to reduce costs. We also will continue to pursue our strategy of growing our business through selective acquisitions and investments.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated summary\nA summary of our segment results is

represent digital marketing services revenues and expenses associated with products sold by our U.S. local publishing sales teams but which are fulfilled by our ReachLocal segment. When discussing segment results, these revenues and expenses are presented gross but are eliminated in consolidation.\nTo facilitate a comparison of our publishing results without the impact of acquisitions, the 53rd week of revenues and expenses, and foreign currency translation fluctuations, 2017 same store revenues and expenses for purposes of comparison to 2016 are calculated as follows:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reported revenues or expenses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Less: revenues or expenses for our 2017 publishing acquisitions from the date of the acquisition through the end of the year\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Less: revenues or expenses for our 2016 publishing acquisitions from the beginning of fiscal year 2017 through the first year anniversary of their applicable acquisition date\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Less: 53rd week revenue or expenses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Less: operations exited in 2017\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Add (less): decreases (increases) in foreign currency translation impacts based on a constant currency calculation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSame store revenues and expenses are not presented for 2018 because no material publishing acquisitions occurred in 2018 or 2017. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions, allocations of certain expenses related to acquired businesses may change. These adjustments may impact the comparability of same store expense numbers across periods; however, such impacts are expected to be immaterial.\nOperating revenues:\nOur publishing segment generates revenue primarily through advertising and marketing services and subscriptions to our print and digital publications. Our advertising teams sell local, national, and classified print advertising products, digital advertising offerings such as digital classified advertisements, digital media such as display advertisements run on our platforms as well as third-party sites, and digital marketing services such as search advertising offered through and delivered by our ReachLocal segment. Circulation revenues are derived principally from home delivery and single copy sales of our publications and distributing our publications on our digital platforms. Other revenues are derived mainly from commercial printing and distribution arrangements.\nOur ReachLocal segment generates advertising and marketing services revenues through multiple services including search advertising, display advertising, search optimization, social media, website development, web presence products, and software-as-a-service solutions.\nRevenue comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nTotal operating revenues were $2.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 7% from 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued softness in publishing segment advertising and marketing services revenues of $185.7 million reflecting decreased demand for print advertising, as well as declines in circulation revenues of $57.7 million due to lower circulation volumes, partially offset by increases from our strategic pricing programs. These declines in operating revenues were partially offset by the increase in revenues of $52.8 million from ReachLocal, primarily attributable to the acquisition of WordStream, the migration of publishing segment customers onto the ReachLocal platform, and increases in average revenue per customer. Overall, operating revenues declined by $40.5 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Additionally, foreign currency rate fluctuations positively impacted operating revenues by $6.7 million.\nRevenue comparisons 2017 - 2016:\nTotal operating revenues were $3.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 3% from 2016 primarily attributable to revenue growth of $248.6 million from ReachLocal, which was acquired in August 2016. Publishing revenues decreased 4% from 2016 which was primarily attributable to the continued softness in publishing segment same store advertising revenues of $212.5 million, reflecting decreased demand for print advertising, as well as declining trends in same store circulation revenues of $84.3 million due to lower circulation volumes partially offset by revenues from our 2016 publishing acquisitions of $157.5 million and 53rd week revenues of $49.1 million. Additionally, foreign currency rate fluctuations negatively impacted publishing revenues by $16.1 million.\nOperating expenses:\nPayroll and benefits are the largest components of our operating expenses. Other significant operating expenses include production and distribution costs.\nOperating expense comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nDuring 2018, total operating expenses decreased 6% to $2.9 billion compared to 2017. Publishing segment expenses decreased by $197.0 million, primarily attributable to continued cost efficiency efforts and reductions in cost of sales due to lower print advertising and circulation revenues. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses from ReachLocal of $34.9 million, primarily attributable to the acquisition of WordStream and higher cost of sales associated with digital marketing services revenue growth. Corporate expenses increased 3% compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs. Foreign currency rate fluctuations also increased expenses by $5.6 million.\nImpacting 2018 operating expenses, and included in the numbers above, were severance-related charges of $51.1 million, asset impairment charges of $50.5 million, accelerated depreciation of $16.7 million, facility consolidation charges of $16.8 million, and acquisition costs of $7.6 million. Impacting 2017 operating expenses, and included in the numbers above, were asset impairment charges of $46.8 million, accelerated depreciation of $44.0 million, severance-related charges of $37.0 million, facility consolidation charges of $7.3 million, and acquisition costs of $5.2 million.\nOperating expense comparisons 2017 - 2016:\nDuring 2017, total operating expenses increased 4% to $3.1 billion compared to 2016. Contributing to the increase were operating expenses associated with our 2016 publishing acquisitions of $158.0 million, expense increases of $248.8 million from ReachLocal, which was acquired in August 2016, and 53rd week expenses of $45.5 million. These additional expenses were partially offset by the continued company-wide cost efficiency efforts and lower newsprint expenses. Foreign currency\nrate fluctuations also reduced expenses by $13.5 million.\nImpacting 2016 operating expenses were asset impairment charges of $55.9 million, severance-related charges of $43.5 million, acquisition costs of $31.9 million, accelerated depreciation of $3.2 million, and facility consolidation charges of $2.2 million.\nPublishing segment\nA summary of our publishing segment results is presented below:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising and marketing services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,311,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,496,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,602,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Circulation\n</td> <td>1,063,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,120,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,133,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>185,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>2,559,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,812,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,933,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>1,626,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,767,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,850,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>574,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>605,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>641,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>96,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>48,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges\n</td> <td>50,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>2,395,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,592,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,697,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Fiscal year 2017 comprises 53 weeks while fiscal years 2018 and 2016 comprise 52 weeks.\nOperating revenues:\nRevenue comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nAdvertising and marketing services revenues were $1.3 billion for 2018, a decrease of 12% compared to 2017, which was primarily attributable to a $201.9 million decline in print advertising revenues as a result of reduced demand consistent with general trends adversely impacting the publishing industry and a $18.6 million decline due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Partially offsetting this decline was an increase in digital advertising and marketing services revenues of $16.2 million. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected advertising and marketing services revenues by $6.7 million.\nPrint advertising revenues were $880.5 million in 2018, a decrease of 19% compared to 2017. Local and national print advertising revenues were $396.6 million and $200.0 million, respectively, for 2018, a decrease of 18% and 23%, respectively, compared to 2017. These declines were attributable to reduced demand consistent with general trends adversely impacting the publishing industry. Classified print advertising revenues of $283.9 million for 2018 decreased 16% compared to 2017, primarily attributable to declines in the automotive, employment, and real estate categories of $19.1 million, $11.7 million, and $11.0 million, respectively. Overall, print advertising revenues declined by $11.8 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017.

Digital classified revenues were $73.9 million for 2018, a decrease of 17% compared to 2017 due to decreases in the digital classified employment and automotive categories of $8.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Digital marketing services revenues were $77.8 million for 2018, an increase of 42% compared to 2017. This increase was attributable to growth in the number of clients and an increase in the average spend per client due to the transition of our local markets to the ReachLocal technology and product platform. Overall, digital advertising revenues were negatively impacted by $6.8 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected total digital advertising and marketing services revenues by $1.8 million.\nCirculation revenues were $1.1 billion for 2018, a decrease of 5% compared to 2017. Print circulation revenues were $816.0 million for 2018, a decrease of 9% from 2017, due to a reduction in volume of our single copy and home delivery sales, reflecting general industry trends, offset by increases from our strategic pricing programs. Digital circulation revenues were $247.0 million for 2018, a 10% increase from 2017, primarily due to the refinement of the allocation to digital revenues based on frequency of delivery. Overall, circulation revenues declined by $13.5 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected circulation revenues by $3.0 million.\nCommercial printing and other revenues of $185.3 million in 2018 decreased 5% compared to 2017 due to reduced demand consistent with general industry trends.

Cost of sales on a same store basis decreased 12%, driven primarily by a decrease in newsprint costs and an overall decline in circulation volumes that reduced production and distribution costs. Newsprint costs on a same store basis of $127.0 million decreased 17% primarily due to lower consumption. Foreign currency rate fluctuations also reduced expenses by $8.1 million. Partially offsetting the decrease in cost of sales was the inclusion of costs associated with our 2016 publishing acquisitions of $116.3 million.\nTotal selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2017 decreased 6% from 2016 to $606.0 million. Selling, general, and administrative expenses on a same store basis decreased 12%, primarily attributable to continued company-wide cost efficiency efforts.

This decline was primarily attributable to declines in print advertising and circulation revenues partially offset by growth in digital advertising and marketing services revenues as well as ongoing operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA was favorably impacted by $0.8 million attributable to foreign exchange rate changes.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our publishing segment decreased 3% from 2016 to 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to declines in same store publishing revenues due to the continued softness in print advertising revenues and declining circulation\ntrends. In addition, there was an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $3.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Partially offsetting these decreases were the increased contributions from our 2016 acquisitions.\nReachLocal\nReachLocal was acquired and became a new operating segment in August 2016.

Active Clients is calculated by adjusting the number of Active Product Units to combine clients with more than one Active Product Unit as a single Active Client. Clients with more than one location are generally reflected as multiple Active Clients with the exception of SweetIQ and WordStream clients. SweetIQ and WordStream clients are generally reflected as single clients regardless of the number of locations served. Because this number includes clients served through ReachLocal's reseller channel, Active Clients includes entities with which ReachLocal does not have a direct contractual relationship. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred and do not include (1) clients at Newsquest using the ReachLocal platform (as ReachLocal does not recognize the revenues associated with these services) and (2) clients from operations which were exited or sold as of the end of the period.\n(b) Active Product Units is a number calculated to approximate the number of individual products, licenses, or services we are providing under contract for Active Clients. For example, if we were performing both SEM and display campaigns for a client that also licenses lead conversion software, we would consider each service separately, resulting in three Active Product Units. Similarly, if a client purchases SEM campaigns for two different products or purposes, we consider each product or purpose as separate Active Product Units. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred.\nOperating revenues:\nRevenue comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nAdvertising and marketing services revenues were $411.5 million for 2018, an increase of 15% compared to 2017, which included revenues from international entities of $96.3 million for 2018 as compared to $96.4 million for 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues of $32.3 million from continued growth in sales from the migration of publishing segment customers onto the ReachLocal platform and a $4.8 million increase in revenues generated from SweetIQ. Additionally, WordStream was acquired in July 2018, which contributed revenues of $29.1 million since the acquisition date. The increase in revenues was partially offset by lower revenues of $11.7 million due to the sale of ReachLocal's German and Japanese affiliates in 2018. Additionally, advertising and marketing services revenues declined by $5.8 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe increase in Active Clients as of December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the addition of WordStream clients, partially offset by reductions in smaller and lower spending clients in North America, mostly from our international customer base, and the impact of the sale of ReachLocal's German and Japanese affiliates in 2018. The increase in Active Product Units as of December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to the\naddition of WordStream and continued cross selling of other ReachLocal products to new and existing bases, partially offset by attrition in Active Clients.\nRevenue comparisons 2017 - 2016:\nAdvertising and marketing services revenues were $358.7 million for 2017, which included revenues from international operations of $96.4 million. In 2017, $29.3 million of advertising revenues were recognized as a result of the transition of publishing segment customers to the ReachLocal platform. Additionally, SweetIQ was acquired in April 2017, which contributed revenues of $5.2 million since the acquisition date. Advertising and marketing services revenues were $110.1 million for 2016 which included revenues from international entities of $33.1 million. Advertising and marketing services revenues for 2016 were negatively impacted by $8.9 million from the revaluation of deferred revenue attributable to the purchase price accounting applied at the acquisition date.\nThe increase in Active Clients and Active Product Units as of December 31, 2017 as compared to December 25, 2016 is attributable to a mixture of organic growth from the North America base business, the migration of the publishing segment digital advertising clients to the ReachLocal platform, the acquisition of SweetIQ, and the onboarding of a significant number of new clients in Brazil, partially offset by declines in Europe and Asia Pacific.\nOperating expenses:\nOperating expense comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nCost of sales, which includes online media acquired from third parties, costs to manage and operate ReachLocal's solutions and technology infrastructure, and other third-party direct costs, was $222.7 million for 2018, an increase of 7% compared to 2017. Cost of online media acquired from third-party publishers totaled $173.8 million for 2018 compared to $163.3 million for 2017. This increase was attributable to an increase of $4.6 million due to cost of sales from the acquisition of WordStream and additional costs associated with the migration of publishing segment customers onto the ReachLocal platform. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue declined due to scaling of the ReachLocal business and the addition of WordStream's higher margins.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for selling and marketing staff, product development and engineering professionals, and other general and administrative functions. Total selling, general, and administrative expenses were $142.6 million for 2018, an increase of 5% compared to 2017. Selling and marketing expenses increased 3% as compared to 2017 due to increased expenses from WordStream of $7.8 million, partially offset by reduced costs from the shutdown of operations in Europe and Japan. Product and technology expenses increased 27% compared to 2017 primarily due to increased WordStream expenses of $3.2 million. Other selling, general, and administrative costs increased 5% as compared to 2017 due to increased expenses of $4.9 million from the acquisition of WordStream partially offset by cost reduction efforts in North America and the shutdown of operations in Europe and Japan.\nDepreciation and amortization were $42.0 million for 2018, an increase of 24% compared to 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to amortization related to the WordStream acquisition and a full year of amortization expense from the SweetIQ acquisition.\nOperating expense comparisons 2017 - 2016:\nCost of sales was $207.3 million for 2017, which included online media acquired from third-party publishers totaling $163.3 million. Cost of sales was $67.4 million in 2016, which included online media acquired from third-party publishers of $66.3 million.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses were $135.5 million for 2017 and $48.6 million for 2016. 2017 totals included salaries, benefits, and other costs related to sales and marketing staff of $43.5 million, commission expense of $32.0 million, general and administrative expenses of $26.2 million, and product and technology expenses of $8.3 million. 2016 totals included salaries, benefits, and other costs of $16.5 million, commission expense of $10.0 million, general and administrative expenses of $8.7 million, and product and technology expenses of $3.0 million.\nDepreciation and amortization was $33.9 million for 2017, which included amortization of developed technology intangible assets of $27.9 million. Depreciation and amortization was $12.2 million for 2016, which included amortization of developed technology intangible assets of $6.6 million.\nReachLocal segment Adjusted EBITDA Table 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,728\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>42,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>4,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges\n</td> <td>377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related items\n</td> <td>459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items\n</td> <td>1,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP basis)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,852\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>***\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*** Indicates an absolute value percentage change greater than 100.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our ReachLocal segment was $47.9 million in 2018 compared to $16.6 million in 2017. Profitability improved in 2018 due to the addition of the higher margin WordStream business of $9.7 million, the scaling of revenues on the ReachLocal platform, and growth in average revenue per client.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our ReachLocal segment was $16.6 million in 2017 compared to a $5.9 million loss in 2016. The adjusted EBITDA loss in 2016 is attributable to the exclusion of $8.9 million in revenue due to the purchase price accounting revaluation of deferred revenue applied at the acquisition date.\nCorporate and other\nCorporate operating revenues were $7.4 million in 2018, $4.8 million in 2017, and $4.2 million in 2016.\nCorporate operating expenses were $141.6 million for 2018, an increase of 3% compared to 2017. Included in corporate operating expenses for 2018 were $8.8 million of severance-related charges and $5.3 million of facility consolidation charges. Included in corporate operating expenses for 2017 were $5.9 million of severance-related charges. The increase in restructuring charges was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $3.2 million.\nCorporate operating expenses were $138.0 million in 2017, an increase of 5% compared to 2016. The increase in expense was primarily driven by increase in depreciation expense of $7.1 million, severance-related charges of $5.8 million, and other business transformation costs, including changes to our expense allocation structure. These increases were offset by a reduction in acquisition-related expenses of $27.1 million.\nNon-operating income (expense)\nInterest expense: Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.7 million compared to $17.1 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense is due to a higher effective interest rate incurred on our convertible debt of 7.91% as compared to an average effective interest rate on our Credit Facility of 4.0%, partially offset by the reduced balance on our Credit Facility of $135.0 million in 2018 as compared to a balance of $355.0 million in 2017.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17.1 million compared to $12.8 million in 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the timing of additional borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nOther non-operating items, net: Our non-operating items, net, are driven by certain items that fall outside of our normal business operations. Our non-operating items, net, consisted of $26.1 million in income for 2018 compared to $9.7 million in expense in 2017. The increase in other non-operating income was due primarily to a decrease of $30.9 million in non-operating pension expense and $10.3 million in gains on the sale of businesses in 2018, partially offset by increases in other non-operating expenses.\nOur non-operating items, net, consisted of $9.7 million in expense for 2017 compared to $10.2 million in expense in 2016. As a result of our early adoption of new accounting guidance, included in non-operating expenses are certain net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs of $21.0 million in 2017 and $9.9 million in 2016. Other non-operating expense, net, for 2017 also included a $2.8 million gain on investment.\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\nThe following table outlines our pre-tax net income and income tax expense amounts:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-tax net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>15,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 50%. This rate was primarily impacted by goodwill impairment related to certain tax assets in the U.K. and an increase in the valuation allowance related to intangible assets. Without these two items, the effective income tax rate would have been 16%, which is lower than the statutory tax rate due to the carryback of net operating losses to a higher tax rate year.\nThe decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2017 to 2018 was primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017. The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of earnings, limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income, elimination of net operating loss carrybacks for losses generated after 2017, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. The Tax Act also includes certain provisions that offset the benefits of the rate reduction such as repeal of the domestic production deduction and disallowance of performance based officers' compensation in excess of $1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have finalized our calculation of historical foreign earnings and have concluded we are not subject to the Transition Tax, resulting in no adjustment to provisional amounts recorded in 2017. In 2017, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21% for U.S. federal tax purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, upon further analysis and refinement of our calculation, we have recognized a favorable adjustment of $2.6 million to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. This amount is primarily related to the carryback of net operating losses into higher tax rate years. We consider the enactment date remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to be completed. We have also elected to account for the tax liability from GILTI tax in the year the tax is incurred.\nOur deferred tax assets were further reduced through the establishment of valuation allowances related to unamortizable intangible assets for two of our publishing properties of $7.6 million and a valuation allowance on share-based compensation of $1.9 million, which were recorded as additional income tax expense in 2018.\nOur pre-tax income earned in foreign jurisdictions continues in 2016 through 2018 to be higher than domestic pre-tax income primarily due to the higher expenses domestically related to restructuring charges and asset impairment charges.\nNet income and earnings per share\nNet income: Net income was $15.0 million for 2018 compared to net income of $6.9 million for 2017. The increase in net income is primarily attributable to the increase in other non-operating items of $35.8 million and the decrease in the provision for income taxes of $18.7 million, offset by a decrease in operating income of $38.8 million.\nNet income was $6.9 million for 2017 compared to $52.7 million for 2016. The decrease in net income is primarily attributable to the decline in operating income of $21.8 million and the increase in the provision for income taxes of $20.1 million.\nDiluted earnings per share: Diluted earnings per share were $0.13 for 2018 compared to earnings per share of $0.06 for 2017. The increase in diluted earnings per share for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the increase in net income discussed above.\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.06 for 2017 compared to $0.44 for 2016. The decrease in diluted earnings per share for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the decline in net income discussed above.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur operations, which have historically generated strong positive cash flow, along with our Credit Facility, are expected to provide sufficient liquidity to allow us to pursue strategic acquisitions and simultaneously meet our financial requirements, including those for investments, dividends, and share repurchases.\nDetails of our cash flows are included in the table below:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flow from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flow used for investing activities\n</td> <td>(128,526\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(519,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flow from (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>(57,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(141,786\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of currency exchange rate change\n</td> <td>1,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(80,004\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating cash flows\nOur net cash flow from operating activities was $157.5 million for 2018 compared to $236.0 million of net cash flow from operating activities for 2017. The decrease in net cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to additional pension and postretirement contributions of $22.4 million. In addition, we made U.S. tax payments, net of refunds of $5.4 million and foreign tax payments, net of refunds of $0.6 million during 2018, compared to tax refunds, net of payments, of $18.9 million in 2017. The remainder of the change in cash flows from operating activities is attributed to the decrease in operating revenues of 7% not completely offset by the decline in cost of sales of 8% and selling, general, and administrative expenses of 3% as well as the overall timing of payments and receipts.\nOur net cash flow from operating activities was $236.0 million in 2017 compared to $167.9 million of net cash flow from operating activities in 2016. The increase in net cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to tax refunds, net of payments, in 2017 of $18.9 million compared to tax payments, net of refunds, in 2016 of $25.7 million. In addition, pension and other postretirement contributions decreased by $34.8 million. The remainder of the change in cash flows from operating activities is due to the overall timing of payments and receipts.\nIn addition to any other contributions that may be required, we expect to contribute approximately $25.0 million to the Gannett Retirement Plan in 2019, as well as $47.0 million in 2020 and $15.0 million in 2021. Of the $47.0 million estimated contribution for 2020, we are contractually obligated to contribute $25.0 million. We also expect to contribute approximately $30.5 million to the U.K. Pension Plans in 2019, $25.2 million in 2020 and $22.9 million in 2021. In 2019, we also expect to make aggregate contributions of $29.6 million to our other underfunded plans and expect to make additional contributions thereafter.\nInvesting cash flows\nCash flows used for investing activities totaled $128.5 million for 2018 primarily driven by payments of $131.2 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the WordStream acquisition, and capital expenditures of $63.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of certain assets of $69.7 million.\nCash flows used for investing activities totaled $87.6 million for 2017 primarily driven by capital expenditures of $72.3 million and payments of $44.3 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the SweetIQ acquisition, partially offset by proceeds from sales of certain assets of $28.4 million.\nCash flows used by investing activities totaled $519.1 million for 2016 primarily driven by payments of $464.1 million for our 2016 acquisitions, capital expenditures of $60.0 million, and investments of $12.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of certain assets of $17.4 million.\nFinancing cash flows\nCash flows used for financing activities totaled $57.9 million for 2018, which included net repayments of borrowings under our Credit Facility of $220.0 million, partially offset by net proceeds from our convertible debt offering of $195.3 million. In addition, we had payments of dividends to our shareholders of $72.3 million and payments for employee taxes\nwithheld from stock awards of $6.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and leaseback of properties accounted for under the financing method of $45.9 million.\nCash flows used for financing activities totaled $141.8 million for 2017, primarily consisting of payment of dividends of $72.3 million, net repayments of borrowings under our Credit Facility of $45.0 million, and share repurchases of $17.4 million.\nCash flows from financing activities were $271.4 million for 2016, primarily as a result of net proceeds from borrowings under our Credit Facility of $400.0 million to fund our 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by the payment of dividends of $92.5 million, and share repurchases of $32.7 million.\nRevolving credit facility\nWe maintain a secured revolving credit facility pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (credit facility). Under the credit facility, we may borrow at an applicable margin above the Eurodollar base rate (LIBOR loan) or the higher of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% (ABR loan). The applicable margin is determined based on our total leverage ratio but differs between LIBOR loans and ABR loans. For LIBOR-based borrowing, the margin varies from 2.00% to 2.50%. For ABR-based borrowing, the margin varies from 1.00% to 1.50%. Up to $50 million of the credit facility is available for issuance of letters of credit. The credit facility matures on June 29, 2020.\nCustomary fees related to the credit facility, including commitment fees on the undrawn commitments of between 0.30% and 0.40% per annum, are payable quarterly in arrears, and are based on our total leverage ratio. Borrowings under the credit facility are guaranteed by our wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries. All obligations of Gannett and each subsidiary guarantor under the credit facility are or will be secured by first priority security interests in our equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, fixtures, general intangibles and other personal property, mortgages on certain material real property, and pledges of the capital stock of each subsidiary guarantor.\nUnder the credit facility, our consolidated interest coverage ratio cannot be less than 3.00:1.00, and our total leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.00:1.00, in each case as of the last day of the test period consisting of the last four consecutive fiscal quarters. We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of December 31, 2018.\nThe credit facility also contains a number of covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability, subject to certain exceptions, to: (i) permit certain liens on current or future assets, (ii) enter into certain corporate transactions, (iii) incur additional indebtedness, (iv) make certain payments or declare certain dividends or distributions, (v) dispose of certain property, (vi) make certain investments, (vii) prepay or amend the terms of other indebtedness, or (viii) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $135.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and $23.1 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $341.9 million of availability.\nConvertible debt\nOn April 9, 2018, we completed an offering of 4.75% convertible senior notes, with an initial offering size of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount. As part of the offering, the initial purchaser of the notes exercised its option to purchase an additional $26.3 million aggregate principal amount of notes, resulting in total aggregate principal of $201.3 million and net proceeds of approximately $195.3 million. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes mature on April 15, 2024 with our earliest redemption date being April 15, 2022. The stated conversion rate of the notes is 82.4572 shares per $1,000 in principal or approximately $12.13 per share.\nUpon conversion, we have the option to settle in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of the two. Additionally, holders may convert the notes at their option prior to January 15, 2024 only if one or more of the following conditions are present: (1) if, during any 20 of the 30 trading days immediately preceding a quarter end, our common stock trading price is 130% of the stated conversion price, (2) if, during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes is less than 98% of the product of (a) the last reported sale price of the company's common stock and (b) the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) a qualified change in control event occurs. Depending on the nature of the triggering event, the conversion rate may also be subject to adjustment.\nAs of December 31, 2018, no shares were issued upon conversion, exercise, or satisfaction of the required conditions because no conversion triggers were considered met during the period.\nShare repurchase program\nIn May 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares with an aggregate value of up to $100 million over a three-year period, replacing our initial program dated July 2015. Shares may be repurchased either in the open market or in privately negotiated block transactions. Management's decision to repurchase shares depends on several factors, including share price and other corporate liquidity requirements. Under these current and legacy programs, we did not repurchase any shares in 2018. In 2017, we repurchased 2.0 million shares at a cost of $17.4 million. In 2016, we repurchased 3.8 million shares at a cost of $32.7 million.\nOperating results non-GAAP information\nPresentation of non-GAAP information: We use non-GAAP financial performance and liquidity measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\nIn this report, we present adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), which are non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of certain items consisting primarily of workforce restructuring charges, facility consolidation costs, and non-cash asset impairment charges. We believe such expenses, charges, and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations, and their inclusion in results makes for more difficult comparisons between years and with peer group companies. In the future, however, we are likely to incur expenses, charges, and gains similar to the items for which the applicable GAAP financial measures have been adjusted and to report non-GAAP financial measures excluding such items. Accordingly, exclusion of those or similar items in our non-GAAP presentations should not be interpreted as implying the items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual.\nWe define our non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, as follows:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure we believe offers a useful view of the overall operation of our businesses.

The tax impact on these non-GAAP tax deductible adjustments is based on the estimated statutory tax rates for the U.K. of 19% and the U.S. of 25.5%. In addition, tax is adjusted in certain years for non-recurring items such as non-deductible acquisition costs, a tax benefit related to a worthless stock and bad debt deduction, effects related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to the tax basis of certain intangibles.

In addition, we made tax payments, net of refunds of $6.0 million in 2018 compared to tax refunds, net of payments, in 2017 of $18.9 million. The remainder of the change in free cash flow is attributed to the decrease in operating revenues of 7% not completely offset by the decline in cost of sales of 8% and selling, general, and administrative expenses of 3% as well as the overall timing of payments and receipts, partially offset by a decrease in cash outflows for capital expenditures of $9.2 million during 2018 compared to 2017.\nFree cash flow for 2017 increased by $55.8 million from the same period in 2016.

Management's decision to repurchase shares will depend on share price and other corporate liquidity requirements. We expect that share repurchases may occur from time to time over the three years.

Future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and the amount of cash dividends per share will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, financial condition, results of operations, level of indebtedness, capital requirements and surplus, contractual restrictions, the number of shares of common stock outstanding, as well as the legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is subject to our continued compliance with the terms of our Credit Facility, including compliance with all financial and other covenants.\nSeasonality\nOur revenues are subject to moderate seasonality due primarily to fluctuations in advertising volumes. Our advertising revenues for publishing are typically highest in the company's fourth quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the first quarter following the holiday season. The volume of advertising sales in any period is also impacted by other external factors such as competitors' pricing, advertisers' decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand, and general economic conditions.\nCritical accounting policies and the use of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most subjective and complex judgments.\nBusiness combinations: We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain identifiable assets include, but are not limited to, expected long-term market growth, future expected operating expenses, cost of capital, and appropriate discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nGoodwill: As of December 31, 2018, we had $779.6 million of goodwill, which represented approximately 31% of our total assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on the first day of our fourth quarter or between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nIn 2018, the company early adopted new accounting guidance which simplifies the goodwill impairment quantitative test by removing the requirement to perform a two-step analysis. Before performing the annual goodwill impairment test, we are first permitted to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative test must be completed. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, as well as company and specific reporting unit specifications. If, after performing this assessment, we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform a quantitative test. Otherwise, the test is not required. For 2018, a qualitative assessment was not used.\nIn the quantitative test, we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. Fair value of the reporting unit is defined as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The company generally determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market-based approach. Estimates of fair value include inputs that are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment that are made at a specific point in time. Changes in key assumptions from period to period could significantly affect the estimates of fair value. Significant assumptions used in the fair value estimates include projected revenues and related growth rates over time, projected operating cash flow margins, discount rates, valuation multiples of entities engaged in the same or similar lines of business, and future economic and market conditions.\nAfter considering the above factors, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment is recorded for the amount of carrying value which exceeds the fair value. Fair value of the reporting units depends on several factors, including the future strength of the economy in our principal markets. New and developing competition as well as technological change could also adversely affect future fair value estimates. Any one or a combination of these factors could lead to declines in reporting unit fair values and result in goodwill impairment charges.\nAll three of our reporting units (Domestic Publishing, the U.K. Group, and ReachLocal) have goodwill balances. The estimated fair value of the Domestic Publishing and ReachLocal reporting units exceeded the carrying value at the most recent measurement date by 7% and 26%, respectively. The carrying value of our U.K. Group reporting unit exceeded the fair value, and a goodwill impairment charge of $13.8 million was recorded. While the goodwill of the Domestic Publishing reporting unit is not currently impaired, there could be an impairment in the future as a result of changes in certain assumptions. In estimating the fair value of the U.K. Group and Domestic Publishing reporting units, the company assumed the rate of revenue decline will decrease over time which has been factored into our long term growth rates and has also assumed there will be additional cost saving measures implemented that will partially offset the revenue declines. Though we believe the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the reporting units are reasonable and achievable, the fair value could be adversely affected if the reporting units are not able to execute on customer opportunities or realize cost savings. Other significant assumptions that could impact the estimated fair value include discount rates and market multiples. When determining these assumptions and preparing projections, we consider each reporting unit's historical results and trends as well as general economic conditions, the risk-free interest rate environment, competitor efforts, and customer spending patterns. Although the assumptions used reflect Gannett's best estimates as of the valuation date, changes in assumptions would affect the estimation of the fair value. A 1% increase in the Domestic Publishing reporting unit weighted average cost of capital would result in the estimated fair value exceeding the carrying value for the reporting unit by 4%. As of December 31, 2018, our reporting units (Domestic Publishing, the U.K. Group, and ReachLocal) have goodwill balances representing 55%, 19%, and 26%, respectively, of the total goodwill balance of $779.6 million.\nIntangible assets (indefinite-lived and amortizable): Intangible assets consist of mastheads, trade names, domain names, developed technology, and customer relationships.\nLocal mastheads (e.g., publishing periodical titles and web site domain names) and certain trade names are not subject to amortization. As a result, they are tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or more frequently if\nevents or changes in circumstances suggest the asset might be impaired. The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each masthead, domain name, or trade name with its carrying amount. We use a relief from royalty approach which utilizes a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of each masthead, domain name, or trade name. Management's judgments and estimates of future operating results in determining the intangibles fair values are consistently applied to each underlying business in determining the fair value of each intangible asset. In 2018, following this testing, we recognized impairment charges of $11.4 million. These charges were to bring the recorded indefinite-lived intangibles equal to their implied fair values based on future projections.\nOur amortizable intangible assets consist mainly of developed technology, customer relationships, and certain trade names and mastheads. Developed technology comprises digital marketing solutions and other technology acquired as part of the ReachLocal, SweetIQ, and WordStream transactions. Customer relationships include subscriber lists and advertiser relationships. These asset values are amortized systematically over their estimated useful lives. When triggering events are identified, an impairment assessment of our definite-lived intangibles is performed using the excess earnings method. The excess earnings method approach utilizes the present value of projected cash flows expected to be generated by the intangibles less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. In 2018, following this testing, we recognized impairment charges of $4.6 million. These charges were to bring the recorded definite-lived intangibles equal to their implied fair values based on future projections.\nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business model or capital strategy could result in actual useful lives differing from our estimates. In cases where we determine the useful life of property, plant, and equipment should be shortened, we would, after evaluating for impairment, depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense.\nAccelerated depreciation was recorded in 2018 and 2017 for certain property, plant, and equipment, reflecting specific decisions to consolidate production and other business services.\nWe review our property, plant, and equipment assets for potential impairment at the asset group level (generally at the local business level) by comparing the carrying value of such assets with the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those asset groups and local business units. The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying value. We measure impairment based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. In 2018, we recognized $20.8 million of impairment charges primarily resulting from assets we have classified as held-for-sale in connection with our facility consolidation and cost saving initiatives.\nPension accounting: We, along with our subsidiaries, have various defined benefit retirement plans under which substantially all of the benefits have been frozen in previous years.\nWe account for our pension plans in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, which requires us to include the funded status of our pension plans in our balance sheets and to recognize, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), the gains or losses that arise during the period but are not recognized in pension expense. Pension expenses associated with service costs are reported on the Consolidated statements of income as Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. All other pension expenses are reported on the Consolidated statements of income as Other non-operating items, net.\nThe determination of pension plan obligations and expense is dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding future events, the most important of which are the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at year-end on corporate bonds rated AA and above with a maturity to match the expected benefit payment stream. A decrease in discount rates would increase pension obligations.\nWe establish the expected long-term rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. We apply the expected long-term rate of return to the fair value of the pension assets in determining the dollar amount of the expected return. Changes in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension plan expense. The effects of actual results differing from these assumptions are accumulated as unamortized gains and losses. A corridor approach is used in the amortization of these gains and losses by amortizing the balance exceeding the greater of 10% of the beginning balances of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. The amortization period is based on the average life expectancy of plan participants, which is currently estimated to be approximately 20 years for our principal retirement plan.\nFor 2018, the assumption used for the funded status discount rate was 4.30% for our principal retirement plan obligations. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate at the end of 2018 would have increased plan obligations by approximately $81.0 million. A 50 basis point change in the discount rate used to calculate 2018 expense would have changed total pension plan expense for 2018 by approximately $1.8 million. We assumed a rate of 7.25% for our long-term expected return on pension assets used for our principal retirement plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 50 basis point decrease in the expected rate of return on pension assets would have increased estimated pension plan expense for 2018 by approximately $8.4 million.\nIncome taxes: We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and record our tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in our reported results of operations. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties in the application of tax laws and regulations.\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax regulations and rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, if any. In assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income.\nOur actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and our forecasted financial condition, and results of operations in future periods. Although we believe current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Management re-evaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available. Our policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of Provision for income taxes.\nThe effect of a 1% change in the effective tax rate for 2018 would have resulted in a change of $0.3 million in the Provision for income taxes and net income.", "summary": "The report discusses Gannett's financial condition, potential risks, and the operation of its various segments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCertain factors affecting forward-looking statements\nCertain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain certain forward-looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance, and other matters. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. The words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"seek,\" \"anticipate,\" \"project,\" and similar expressions, among others, generally identify \"forward-looking statements\" which speak only as of the date the statements were made and are not guarantees of future performance. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to many risks, trends, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied in the forward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of our management, is expressed in good faith, and is believed to have a reasonable basis. However, there can be no assurance the expectation or belief will result, be achieved, or be accomplished.

Our operations also include commercial printing.\nBasis of reporting\nThe following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our accounting for or reporting on the business over the last three fiscal years. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, selected financial data, and the remainder of this Form 10-K.\nFiscal year: Starting in 2018, our fiscal year coincides with the Gregorian calendar. In 2017 and prior, our fiscal years ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. Our fiscal year for 2018 was a 52-week year ending on December 31, 2018. Fiscal year 2017 was a 53-week year ending on December 31, 2017, and fiscal year 2016 was a 52-week year ending on December 25, 2016.\nAdvertising and marketing services revenues: In 2018, we realigned the presentation of web presence and software-as-a-service revenues from other revenues to advertising and marketing services revenues on the Consolidated statements of income. As a result of this updated presentation, advertising and marketing services revenues increased and other revenues decreased $46.2 million, $34.6 million, and $9.2 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Operating revenues, net income, retained earnings, and earnings per share remained unchanged.\nCertain matters affecting current and future operating results\nThe following developments affect period-over-period comparisons and will affect period-over-period comparisons for future results:\nAcquisitions\n \u2022 WordStream, Inc. (WordStream) - In July 2018, our ReachLocal segment completed the acquisition of WordStream, a provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service solutions for local and regional businesses and agencies, for approximately $132.5 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, up to $20.0 million of additional consideration is payable in 2019 and 2020 based upon the achievement of certain revenue targets. \n \u2022 SweetIQ Analytics Corp. (SweetIQ) - In April 2017, we completed the acquisition of SweetIQ, a location and customer engagement software provider, for approximately $31.8 million, net of cash acquired. SweetIQ's customers include businesses with multi-location brands and agencies that target local marketing. \n \u2022 ReachLocal, Inc. (ReachLocal) - In August 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of ReachLocal for approximately $162.5 million, net of cash acquired. ReachLocal offers online marketing, digital advertising, software-as-a-service, and web presence products and solutions to local businesses. \n \u2022 Certain assets of North Jersey Media Group, Inc. (NJMG) - In July 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of NJMG for approximately $38.6 million. NJMG is a media company with print and digital publishing operations serving  primarily the northern New Jersey market.\n \u2022 Journal Media Group, Inc. (JMG) - In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of JMG for approximately $260.6 million, net of cash acquired. JMG is a media company with print and digital publishing operations serving 15 U.S. markets in nine states. \n \u2022 We completed other immaterial acquisitions during the periods presented. \nRestructuring and asset impairment costs\nOver the past several years, we have engaged in a series of individual restructuring programs designed to right size our employee base and improve operations, including those of recently acquired entities. In addition, we have engaged in facility consolidation initiatives which include the disposition of older, under-utilized buildings, relocations to more efficient, flexible, digitally-oriented office spaces, efforts to reconfigure spaces to take advantage of leasing and subleasing opportunities, and the combination of production and distribution operations where possible. These facility consolidation and other cost savings plans led us to recognize severance charges, asset impairment charges, shutdown costs, and charges associated with reducing the useful lives of certain assets. As part of our plans, we are selling certain assets which we have classified as held-for-sale and reduced carrying values to equal fair value less costs to dispose. In addition, we had impairments of intangible assets which were principally a result of cash flow projections which were lower than expected.\nIn conjunction with these programs, we incurred restructuring costs of $67.9 million in 2018, $44.3 million in 2017, and $45.8 million in 2016. Included in these restructuring costs are severance costs of $51.1 million in 2018, $37.0 million in 2017, and $43.5 million in 2016. In 2018, we offered an early retirement opportunity program (EROP) for certain employees in our Domestic Publishing and Corporate units for which $27.8 million of severance costs were incurred and are included in the severance costs above.\nWe recorded asset impairment charges of $50.5 million in 2018, $46.8 million in 2017, and $55.9 million in 2016. We also recorded accelerated depreciation of $16.7 million in 2018, $44.0 million in 2017, and $3.2 million in 2016.\nForeign currency\nOur U.K. publishing operations are conducted through our Newsquest subsidiary. In addition, ReachLocal has foreign operations in regions such as Asia-Pacific and South America. Our earnings from operations in foreign regions are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.\nWith respect to Newsquest, the average exchange rate used to translate U.K. results was 1.33 for 2018, 1.29 for 2017, and 1.36 for 2016. Translation fluctuations impact our U.K. revenue, expense, and operating income results. The 4% increase in the exchange rate from 2017 to 2018 favorably impacted 2018 revenue comparisons by approximately $10.5 million. The 5% decrease in the exchange rate from 2016 to 2017 unfavorably impacted 2017 revenue comparisons by approximately $16.1 million.\nImpacts stemming from foreign currency translation gains and losses at our ReachLocal segment unfavorably impacted revenue by $3.8 million in 2018. In 2017 and 2016, foreign currency translation gains and losses were immaterial.\nNewsprint supply\nThe newsprint supply available to U.S. publishers is volatile. In 2017, North American newsprint producers permanently removed production capacity approaching one million metric tonnes per year, and similar production capacity reductions were witnessed outside of North America. In addition, in the first six months of 2018, many Canadian producers were subjected to significant anti-dumping and countervailing duties upon importation of newsprint into the U.S. Those duties were ultimately eliminated by the International Trade Commission in September 2018, but their imposition in the first half of 2018 disrupted the newsprint market by driving prices higher and incentivizing Canadian producers to reduce their shipments of newsprint into the United States.\nAs a result of the above, newsprint prices remained elevated throughout 2018; however, newsprint expense at our publishing segment was effectively flat in 2018 as rising prices were offset by declines in circulation volumes and usage.\nOutlook for 2019\nAs we move into 2019, we remain focused on executing our strategic vision of being essential to consumers and marketers seeking meaningful connections with their communities across print, digital, and other channels. In 2018, we completed our organizational realignment that reorganized our business into two functions - Marketing Solutions and Consumer. In our Marketing Solutions business, we are focused on developing a more comprehensive suite of marketing products and services, including the integration of the recent WordStream acquisition. Although print advertising will remain challenged due to market pressures, we are aggressively focused on driving a deeper penetration of our digital advertising and marketing service products within our local client base as well as acquiring new clients. Our Consumer organization is focused on growing our audiences and deepening engagement, in part by expanding our spectrum of content beyond traditional news into new verticals and platforms. We will continue to strive to maximize operational excellence by working to maximize the efficiency of our print, sales, administrative, and distribution functions to reduce costs. We also will continue to pursue our strategy of growing our business through selective acquisitions and investments.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated summary\nA summary of our segment results is presented below:\n\n*** Indicates an absolute value percentage change greater than 100.\n(1) Fiscal year 2017 comprises 53 weeks while fiscal years 2018 and 2016 comprise 52 weeks.\nIntersegment eliminations in the preceding table represent digital marketing services revenues and expenses associated with products sold by our U.S. local publishing sales teams but which are fulfilled by our ReachLocal segment. When discussing segment results, these revenues and expenses are presented gross but are eliminated in consolidation.\nTo facilitate a comparison of our publishing results without the impact of acquisitions, the 53rd week of revenues and expenses, and foreign currency translation fluctuations, 2017 same store revenues and expenses for purposes of comparison to 2016 are calculated as follows:\n \u2022 Reported revenues or expenses \n \u2022 Less: revenues or expenses for our 2017 publishing acquisitions from the date of the acquisition through the end of the year \n \u2022 Less: revenues or expenses for our 2016 publishing acquisitions from the beginning of fiscal year 2017 through the first year anniversary of their applicable acquisition date \n \u2022 Less: 53rd week revenue or expenses \n \u2022 Less: operations exited in 2017 \n \u2022 Add (less): decreases (increases) in foreign currency translation impacts based on a constant currency calculation \nSame store revenues and expenses are not presented for 2018 because no material publishing acquisitions occurred in 2018 or 2017. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions, allocations of certain expenses related to acquired businesses may change. These adjustments may impact the comparability of same store expense numbers across periods; however, such impacts are expected to be immaterial.\nOperating revenues:\nOur publishing segment generates revenue primarily through advertising and marketing services and subscriptions to our print and digital publications. Our advertising teams sell local, national, and classified print advertising products, digital advertising offerings such as digital classified advertisements, digital media such as display advertisements run on our platforms as well as third-party sites, and digital marketing services such as search advertising offered through and delivered by our ReachLocal segment. Circulation revenues are derived principally from home delivery and single copy sales of our publications and distributing our publications on our digital platforms. Other revenues are derived mainly from commercial printing and distribution arrangements.\nOur ReachLocal segment generates advertising and marketing services revenues through multiple services including search advertising, display advertising, search optimization, social media, website development, web presence products, and software-as-a-service solutions.\nRevenue comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nTotal operating revenues were $2.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 7% from 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued softness in publishing segment advertising and marketing services revenues of $185.7 million reflecting decreased demand for print advertising, as well as declines in circulation revenues of $57.7 million due to lower circulation volumes, partially offset by increases from our strategic pricing programs. These declines in operating revenues were partially offset by the increase in revenues of $52.8 million from ReachLocal, primarily attributable to the acquisition of WordStream, the migration of publishing segment customers onto the ReachLocal platform, and increases in average revenue per customer. Overall, operating revenues declined by $40.5 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Additionally, foreign currency rate fluctuations positively impacted operating revenues by $6.7 million.\nRevenue comparisons 2017 - 2016:\nTotal operating revenues were $3.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 3% from 2016 primarily attributable to revenue growth of $248.6 million from ReachLocal, which was acquired in August 2016. Publishing revenues decreased 4% from 2016 which was primarily attributable to the continued softness in publishing segment same store advertising revenues of $212.5 million, reflecting decreased demand for print advertising, as well as declining trends in same store circulation revenues of $84.3 million due to lower circulation volumes partially offset by revenues from our 2016 publishing acquisitions of $157.5 million and 53rd week revenues of $49.1 million. Additionally, foreign currency rate fluctuations negatively impacted publishing revenues by $16.1 million.\nOperating expenses:\nPayroll and benefits are the largest components of our operating expenses. Other significant operating expenses include production and distribution costs.\nOperating expense comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nDuring 2018, total operating expenses decreased 6% to $2.9 billion compared to 2017. Publishing segment expenses decreased by $197.0 million, primarily attributable to continued cost efficiency efforts and reductions in cost of sales due to lower print advertising and circulation revenues. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses from ReachLocal of $34.9 million, primarily attributable to the acquisition of WordStream and higher cost of sales associated with digital marketing services revenue growth. Corporate expenses increased 3% compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs. Foreign currency rate fluctuations also increased expenses by $5.6 million.\nImpacting 2018 operating expenses, and included in the numbers above, were severance-related charges of $51.1 million, asset impairment charges of $50.5 million, accelerated depreciation of $16.7 million, facility consolidation charges of $16.8 million, and acquisition costs of $7.6 million. Impacting 2017 operating expenses, and included in the numbers above, were asset impairment charges of $46.8 million, accelerated depreciation of $44.0 million, severance-related charges of $37.0 million, facility consolidation charges of $7.3 million, and acquisition costs of $5.2 million.\nOperating expense comparisons 2017 - 2016:\nDuring 2017, total operating expenses increased 4% to $3.1 billion compared to 2016. Contributing to the increase were operating expenses associated with our 2016 publishing acquisitions of $158.0 million, expense increases of $248.8 million from ReachLocal, which was acquired in August 2016, and 53rd week expenses of $45.5 million. These additional expenses were partially offset by the continued company-wide cost efficiency efforts and lower newsprint expenses. Foreign currency\nrate fluctuations also reduced expenses by $13.5 million.\nImpacting 2016 operating expenses were asset impairment charges of $55.9 million, severance-related charges of $43.5 million, acquisition costs of $31.9 million, accelerated depreciation of $3.2 million, and facility consolidation charges of $2.2 million.\nPublishing segment\nA summary of our publishing segment results is presented below:\n\n(1) Fiscal year 2017 comprises 53 weeks while fiscal years 2018 and 2016 comprise 52 weeks.\nOperating revenues:\nRevenue comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nAdvertising and marketing services revenues were $1.3 billion for 2018, a decrease of 12% compared to 2017, which was primarily attributable to a $201.9 million decline in print advertising revenues as a result of reduced demand consistent with general trends adversely impacting the publishing industry and a $18.6 million decline due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Partially offsetting this decline was an increase in digital advertising and marketing services revenues of $16.2 million. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected advertising and marketing services revenues by $6.7 million.\nPrint advertising revenues were $880.5 million in 2018, a decrease of 19% compared to 2017. Local and national print advertising revenues were $396.6 million and $200.0 million, respectively, for 2018, a decrease of 18% and 23%, respectively, compared to 2017. These declines were attributable to reduced demand consistent with general trends adversely impacting the publishing industry. Classified print advertising revenues of $283.9 million for 2018 decreased 16% compared to 2017, primarily attributable to declines in the automotive, employment, and real estate categories of $19.1 million, $11.7 million, and $11.0 million, respectively. Overall, print advertising revenues declined by $11.8 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017.

This increase was attributable to growth in the number of clients and an increase in the average spend per client due to the transition of our local markets to the ReachLocal technology and product platform. Overall, digital advertising revenues were negatively impacted by $6.8 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected total digital advertising and marketing services revenues by $1.8 million.\nCirculation revenues were $1.1 billion for 2018, a decrease of 5% compared to 2017. Print circulation revenues were $816.0 million for 2018, a decrease of 9% from 2017, due to a reduction in volume of our single copy and home delivery sales, reflecting general industry trends, offset by increases from our strategic pricing programs. Digital circulation revenues were $247.0 million for 2018, a 10% increase from 2017, primarily due to the refinement of the allocation to digital revenues based on frequency of delivery. Overall, circulation revenues declined by $13.5 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected circulation revenues by $3.0 million.\nCommercial printing and other revenues of $185.3 million in 2018 decreased 5% compared to 2017 due to reduced demand consistent with general industry trends. Other revenues accounted for approximately 7% of total revenues for the year.\nRevenue comparisons 2017 - 2016:\nAdvertising and marketing services revenues were $1.5 billion for 2017, a decrease of 7% compared 2016. This decrease was attributable to the decline in same store advertising revenues of 13% due to lower print advertising demand consistent with general trends adversely impacting the publishing industry. This decline was partially offset by advertising revenues associated with our 2016 publishing acquisitions of $90.6 million and 53rd week advertising revenues of $20.7 million. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected advertising revenues by $10.3 million.\nPrint advertising revenues were $1.1 billion for 2017, a decrease of 10% compared to 2016. Same store local and national print advertising revenues were $438.0 million and $240.9 million, respectively, for 2017, a decrease of 18% and 19%, respectively, compared to 2016.

Same store digital classified revenues were $87.2 million for 2017, a decrease of 10% compared to 2016 due to decreases in the digital classified employment and automotive categories of $6.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Same store digital marketing services revenues were $53.9 million for 2017, an increase of 7% compared to 2016. This increase was attributable to growth in the number of clients and an increase in the average spend per client due to the transition of our local markets to the ReachLocal technology and product platform. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected total digital advertising and marketing services revenues by $2.8 million.\nCirculation revenues were $1.1 billion for 2017, a decrease of 1% compared to 2016.

This commentary should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, selected financial data, and the remainder of this Form 10-K.\nFiscal year: Starting in 2018, our fiscal year coincides with the Gregorian calendar.

(WordStream) - In July 2018, our ReachLocal segment completed the acquisition of WordStream, a provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service solutions for local and regional businesses and agencies, for approximately $132.5 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, up to $20.0 million of additional consideration is payable in 2019 and 2020 based upon the achievement of certain revenue targets. \n \u2022 SweetIQ Analytics Corp. (SweetIQ) - In April 2017, we completed the acquisition of SweetIQ, a location and customer engagement software provider, for approximately $31.8 million, net of cash acquired. SweetIQ's customers include businesses with multi-location brands and agencies that target local marketing. \n \u2022 ReachLocal, Inc. (ReachLocal) - In August 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of ReachLocal for approximately $162.5 million, net of cash acquired. ReachLocal offers online marketing, digital advertising, software-as-a-service, and web presence products and solutions to local businesses. \n \u2022 Certain assets of North Jersey Media Group, Inc. (NJMG) - In July 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of NJMG for approximately $38.6 million. NJMG is a media company with print and digital publishing operations serving  primarily the northern New Jersey market.\n \u2022 Journal Media Group, Inc. (JMG) - In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of JMG for approximately $260.6 million, net of cash acquired. JMG is a media company with print and digital publishing operations serving 15 U.S. markets in nine states. \n \u2022 We completed other immaterial acquisitions during the periods presented. \nRestructuring and asset impairment costs\nOver the past several years, we have engaged in a series of individual restructuring programs designed to right size our employee base and improve operations, including those of recently acquired entities. In addition, we have engaged in facility consolidation initiatives which include the disposition of older, under-utilized buildings, relocations to more efficient, flexible, digitally-oriented office spaces, efforts to reconfigure spaces to take advantage of leasing and subleasing opportunities, and the combination of production and distribution operations where possible. These facility consolidation and other cost savings plans led us to recognize severance charges, asset impairment charges, shutdown costs, and charges associated with reducing the useful lives of certain assets. As part of our plans, we are selling certain assets which we have classified as held-for-sale and reduced carrying values to equal fair value less costs to dispose. In addition, we had impairments of intangible assets which were principally a result of cash flow projections which were lower than expected.\nIn conjunction with these programs, we incurred restructuring costs of $67.9 million in 2018, $44.3 million in 2017, and $45.8 million in 2016. Included in these restructuring costs are severance costs of $51.1 million in 2018, $37.0 million in 2017, and $43.5 million in 2016. In 2018, we offered an early retirement opportunity program (EROP) for certain employees in our Domestic Publishing and Corporate units for which $27.8 million of severance costs were incurred and are included in the severance costs above.\nWe recorded asset impairment charges of $50.5 million in 2018, $46.8 million in 2017, and $55.9 million in 2016. We also recorded accelerated depreciation of $16.7 million in 2018, $44.0 million in 2017, and $3.2 million in 2016.\nForeign currency\nOur U.K. publishing operations are conducted through our Newsquest subsidiary. In addition, ReachLocal has foreign operations in regions such as Asia-Pacific and South America. Our earnings from operations in foreign regions are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.\nWith respect to Newsquest, the average exchange rate used to translate U.K. results was 1.33 for 2018, 1.29 for 2017, and 1.36 for 2016. Translation fluctuations impact our U.K. revenue, expense, and operating income results. The 4% increase in the exchange rate from 2017 to 2018 favorably impacted 2018 revenue comparisons by approximately $10.5 million. The 5% decrease in the exchange rate from 2016 to 2017 unfavorably impacted 2017 revenue comparisons by approximately $16.1 million.\nImpacts stemming from foreign currency translation gains and losses at our ReachLocal segment unfavorably impacted revenue by $3.8 million in 2018. In 2017 and 2016, foreign currency translation gains and losses were immaterial.\nNewsprint supply\nThe newsprint supply available to U.S. publishers is volatile. In 2017, North American newsprint producers permanently removed production capacity approaching one million metric tonnes per year, and similar production capacity reductions were witnessed outside of North America. In addition, in the first six months of 2018, many Canadian producers were subjected to significant anti-dumping and countervailing duties upon importation of newsprint into the U.S. Those duties were ultimately eliminated by the International Trade Commission in September 2018, but their imposition in the first half of 2018 disrupted the newsprint market by driving prices higher and incentivizing Canadian producers to reduce their shipments of newsprint into the United States.\nAs a result of the above, newsprint prices remained elevated throughout 2018; however, newsprint expense at our publishing segment was effectively flat in 2018 as rising prices were offset by declines in circulation volumes and usage.\nOutlook for 2019\nAs we move into 2019, we remain focused on executing our strategic vision of being essential to consumers and marketers seeking meaningful connections with their communities across print, digital, and other channels. In 2018, we completed our organizational realignment that reorganized our business into two functions - Marketing Solutions and Consumer. In our Marketing Solutions business, we are focused on developing a more comprehensive suite of marketing products and services, including the integration of the recent WordStream acquisition. Although print advertising will remain challenged due to market pressures, we are aggressively focused on driving a deeper penetration of our digital advertising and marketing service products within our local client base as well as acquiring new clients. Our Consumer organization is focused on growing our audiences and deepening engagement, in part by expanding our spectrum of content beyond traditional news into new verticals and platforms. We will continue to strive to maximize operational excellence by working to maximize the efficiency of our print, sales, administrative, and distribution functions to reduce costs. We also will continue to pursue our strategy of growing our business through selective acquisitions and investments.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated summary\nA summary of our segment results is

represent digital marketing services revenues and expenses associated with products sold by our U.S. local publishing sales teams but which are fulfilled by our ReachLocal segment. When discussing segment results, these revenues and expenses are presented gross but are eliminated in consolidation.\nTo facilitate a comparison of our publishing results without the impact of acquisitions, the 53rd week of revenues and expenses, and foreign currency translation fluctuations, 2017 same store revenues and expenses for purposes of comparison to 2016 are calculated as follows:\n \u2022 Reported revenues or expenses \n \u2022 Less: revenues or expenses for our 2017 publishing acquisitions from the date of the acquisition through the end of the year \n \u2022 Less: revenues or expenses for our 2016 publishing acquisitions from the beginning of fiscal year 2017 through the first year anniversary of their applicable acquisition date \n \u2022 Less: 53rd week revenue or expenses \n \u2022 Less: operations exited in 2017 \n \u2022 Add (less): decreases (increases) in foreign currency translation impacts based on a constant currency calculation \nSame store revenues and expenses are not presented for 2018 because no material publishing acquisitions occurred in 2018 or 2017. As we continue to integrate our acquisitions, allocations of certain expenses related to acquired businesses may change. These adjustments may impact the comparability of same store expense numbers across periods; however, such impacts are expected to be immaterial.\nOperating revenues:\nOur publishing segment generates revenue primarily through advertising and marketing services and subscriptions to our print and digital publications. Our advertising teams sell local, national, and classified print advertising products, digital advertising offerings such as digital classified advertisements, digital media such as display advertisements run on our platforms as well as third-party sites, and digital marketing services such as search advertising offered through and delivered by our ReachLocal segment. Circulation revenues are derived principally from home delivery and single copy sales of our publications and distributing our publications on our digital platforms. Other revenues are derived mainly from commercial printing and distribution arrangements.\nOur ReachLocal segment generates advertising and marketing services revenues through multiple services including search advertising, display advertising, search optimization, social media, website development, web presence products, and software-as-a-service solutions.\nRevenue comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nTotal operating revenues were $2.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 7% from 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued softness in publishing segment advertising and marketing services revenues of $185.7 million reflecting decreased demand for print advertising, as well as declines in circulation revenues of $57.7 million due to lower circulation volumes, partially offset by increases from our strategic pricing programs. These declines in operating revenues were partially offset by the increase in revenues of $52.8 million from ReachLocal, primarily attributable to the acquisition of WordStream, the migration of publishing segment customers onto the ReachLocal platform, and increases in average revenue per customer. Overall, operating revenues declined by $40.5 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Additionally, foreign currency rate fluctuations positively impacted operating revenues by $6.7 million.\nRevenue comparisons 2017 - 2016:\nTotal operating revenues were $3.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 3% from 2016 primarily attributable to revenue growth of $248.6 million from ReachLocal, which was acquired in August 2016. Publishing revenues decreased 4% from 2016 which was primarily attributable to the continued softness in publishing segment same store advertising revenues of $212.5 million, reflecting decreased demand for print advertising, as well as declining trends in same store circulation revenues of $84.3 million due to lower circulation volumes partially offset by revenues from our 2016 publishing acquisitions of $157.5 million and 53rd week revenues of $49.1 million. Additionally, foreign currency rate fluctuations negatively impacted publishing revenues by $16.1 million.\nOperating expenses:\nPayroll and benefits are the largest components of our operating expenses. Other significant operating expenses include production and distribution costs.\nOperating expense comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nDuring 2018, total operating expenses decreased 6% to $2.9 billion compared to 2017. Publishing segment expenses decreased by $197.0 million, primarily attributable to continued cost efficiency efforts and reductions in cost of sales due to lower print advertising and circulation revenues. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses from ReachLocal of $34.9 million, primarily attributable to the acquisition of WordStream and higher cost of sales associated with digital marketing services revenue growth. Corporate expenses increased 3% compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs. Foreign currency rate fluctuations also increased expenses by $5.6 million.\nImpacting 2018 operating expenses, and included in the numbers above, were severance-related charges of $51.1 million, asset impairment charges of $50.5 million, accelerated depreciation of $16.7 million, facility consolidation charges of $16.8 million, and acquisition costs of $7.6 million. Impacting 2017 operating expenses, and included in the numbers above, were asset impairment charges of $46.8 million, accelerated depreciation of $44.0 million, severance-related charges of $37.0 million, facility consolidation charges of $7.3 million, and acquisition costs of $5.2 million.\nOperating expense comparisons 2017 - 2016:\nDuring 2017, total operating expenses increased 4% to $3.1 billion compared to 2016. Contributing to the increase were operating expenses associated with our 2016 publishing acquisitions of $158.0 million, expense increases of $248.8 million from ReachLocal, which was acquired in August 2016, and 53rd week expenses of $45.5 million. These additional expenses were partially offset by the continued company-wide cost efficiency efforts and lower newsprint expenses. Foreign currency\nrate fluctuations also reduced expenses by $13.5 million.\nImpacting 2016 operating expenses were asset impairment charges of $55.9 million, severance-related charges of $43.5 million, acquisition costs of $31.9 million, accelerated depreciation of $3.2 million, and facility consolidation charges of $2.2 million.\nPublishing segment\nA summary of our publishing segment results is presented below:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising and marketing services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,311,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,496,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,602,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Circulation\n</td> <td>1,063,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,120,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,133,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>185,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>2,559,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,812,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,933,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>1,626,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,767,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,850,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>574,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>605,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>641,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>96,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>48,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges\n</td> <td>50,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>2,395,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,592,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,697,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Fiscal year 2017 comprises 53 weeks while fiscal years 2018 and 2016 comprise 52 weeks.\nOperating revenues:\nRevenue comparisons 2018 - 2017:\nAdvertising and marketing services revenues were $1.3 billion for 2018, a decrease of 12% compared to 2017, which was primarily attributable to a $201.9 million decline in print advertising revenues as a result of reduced demand consistent with general trends adversely impacting the publishing industry and a $18.6 million decline due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Partially offsetting this decline was an increase in digital advertising and marketing services revenues of $16.2 million. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected advertising and marketing services revenues by $6.7 million.\nPrint advertising revenues were $880.5 million in 2018, a decrease of 19% compared to 2017. Local and national print advertising revenues were $396.6 million and $200.0 million, respectively, for 2018, a decrease of 18% and 23%, respectively, compared to 2017. These declines were attributable to reduced demand consistent with general trends adversely impacting the publishing industry. Classified print advertising revenues of $283.9 million for 2018 decreased 16% compared to 2017, primarily attributable to declines in the automotive, employment, and real estate categories of $19.1 million, $11.7 million, and $11.0 million, respectively. Overall, print advertising revenues declined by $11.8 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected print advertising revenues by $4.9 million.\nDigital advertising and marketing services revenues were $430.8 million for 2018, an increase of 4% compared to 2017. Digital media revenues were $279.1 million for 2018, an increase of 3% compared to 2017, primarily due to growth in national premium and programmatic sales. Digital classified revenues were $73.9 million for 2018, a decrease of 17% compared to 2017 due to decreases in the digital classified employment and automotive categories of $8.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Digital marketing services revenues were $77.8 million for 2018, an increase of 42% compared to 2017. This increase was attributable to growth in the number of clients and an increase in the average spend per client due to the transition of our local markets to the ReachLocal technology and product platform. Overall, digital advertising revenues were negatively impacted by $6.8 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected total digital advertising and marketing services revenues by $1.8 million.\nCirculation revenues were $1.1 billion for 2018, a decrease of 5% compared to 2017. Print circulation revenues were $816.0 million for 2018, a decrease of 9% from 2017, due to a reduction in volume of our single copy and home delivery sales, reflecting general industry trends, offset by increases from our strategic pricing programs. Digital circulation revenues were $247.0 million for 2018, a 10% increase from 2017, primarily due to the refinement of the allocation to digital revenues based on frequency of delivery. Overall, circulation revenues declined by $13.5 million due to six fewer days in 2018 compared to 2017.
