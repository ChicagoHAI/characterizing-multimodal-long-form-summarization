In February 2019, we announced that while the tenets of this plan remain intact, we no longer believed it is in the shareholders' best interest for the separation to include a public spin.\nOn May 8, 2019, we, Parent and Merger Sub entered into the Merger Agreement to be acquired by the Consortium. Upon the close of the Merger, we will operate as a privately-held company. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by the Consortium. Please see Significant Merger Development\u201d in the below Overview\u201d.\nOverview\nIntroduction\nWe are a large and growing provider of access to bandwidth infrastructure in the United States ( U.S.\u201d), Europe and Canada. Our products and offerings enable our customers' mission-critical, high-bandwidth applications, such as cloud-based computing, video, mobile, social media, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications. Our key products and offerings include leased dark fiber, fiber to cellular towers and small cell sites, dedicated wavelength connections, Ethernet, IP connectivity, cloud-based computing and storage products and other\nhigh-bandwidth offerings. We provide access to our bandwidth infrastructure and other offerings over a unique set of dense metro, regional, and long-haul fiber network sections and through our interconnect-oriented data center facilities. Our fiber network sections and data center facilities are critical components of the overall physical network architecture of the Internet and private networks. Our customer base includes some of the largest and most sophisticated users of bandwidth infrastructure, such as wireless service carriers; telecommunications service carriers; financial services companies; social networking, media, and web content companies; education, research, and healthcare institutions; and governmental agencies. We typically provide customers with access to our bandwidth infrastructure solutions for a fixed monthly recurring fee under contracts that vary between one and twenty or more years in length. We operate our business with a unique focus on capital allocation and financial performance with the ultimate goal of maximizing equity value for our stockholders. Our core values center on partnership, alignment, and transparency with our three primary constituent groups - employees, customers, and stockholders.\nOn October 22, 2014, we completed an initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of shares of our common stock, which were listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ZAYO\u201d. Prior to the IPO, we were a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC (\"CII\"). Our primary operating subsidiary is Zayo Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( ZGL\u201d), and we are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.\nOur fiscal year ends June 30 each year, and we refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as Fiscal 2019,\u201d the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 as Fiscal 2018,\u201d and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as Fiscal 2017.\u201d\nReportable Segments and our Strategic Product Groups\nWe use the management approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented. The management approach is based on the manner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance. With the continued increase in our scope and scale, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, our CODM, who is our Chief Executive Officer, implemented certain organizational changes to the management and operation of the business that directly impact how the CODM makes resource allocation decisions and manages the Company. The changes in structure had the impact of combining our legacy Fiber Solutions, Transport, and Enterprise Networks segments into a single new segment, Zayo Networks, and re-aligning our Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG from our legacy Enterprise Networks segment to our zColo segment. These changes to our existing reportable segments have been recast for all prior period financial and operating metrics presented in this Annual Report for comparability. Our four reportable segments are described below.\nZayo Networks. Our Zayo Networks segment provides access to bandwidth infrastructure. This includes our Fiber, Layer 2/3 and Transport solutions. Within the Fiber business, Zayo provides access to mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell). Our mobile infrastructure solutions permit direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites and mobile switching centers. Fiber solutions customers include carriers and other communication service providers, internet service providers, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises and other companies that have the expertise to run their own fiber optic networks or require interconnected technical space. The contract terms for fiber solutions customers tend to range from three to twenty or more years. Our Layer 2/3 line of business provides connectivity and telecommunications solutions to medium and large enterprises. Our offerings within Layer 2/3 include Ethernet, IP, Transit Offerings, Wide Area Networking products, Media Networks and CloudLink. Solutions range from point-to-point data connections to multi-site managed networks to international outsourced IT infrastructure environments. The contract terms for Layer 2/3 solutions tend to range from one to five years. Our Transport line of business provide access to lit communications bandwidth infrastructure using customer-accessed optronics to light the fiber and, and our customers pay for access based on the amount and type of bandwidth they require. We target customers who require a significant amount of bandwidth across their networks. Transport customers include carriers, content providers, financial services companies, healthcare, government entities, education institutions and other medium and large enterprises. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years.\nZayo Colocation ( zColo\u201d). The zColo segment provides data center and cloud infrastructure solutions to a broad range of enterprise, carrier, cloud and content customers. Our offerings within this segment include\nthe provision of colocation space, power and interconnection offerings in North America and Western Europe. Solutions range in size from single cabinet solutions to 1MW+ data center infrastructure environments. Our data centers also support networking components for the purpose of aggregating and accommodating customers' data, voice, internet and video traffic. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years. Our Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG is included in the zColo segment. The Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG combines private cloud, public cloud and managed offerings in order to provide its customers secure infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which enables on-demand scaling and virtual computing in hybrid environments.\nAllstream. The Allstream segment provides Cloud VoIP and Data Solutions. This includes a full range of local voice offerings allowing business customers to complete telephone calls in their local exchange, as well as make long distance, toll-free and related calls. Unified Communications is the integration of real-time communication services such as telephony (including Cloud-based IP telephony), instant messaging and video conferencing with non-real-time communication services, such as integrated voicemail and e-mail. Allstream also provides customers with comprehensive telecommunications services including Ethernet, and IP/MPLS VPN Solutions.\nOther. The Other segment is primarily comprised of Zayo Professional Services. ZPS provides network and technical resources to customers who wish to leverage the Company's expertise in designing, acquiring and maintaining a network. The contract terms typically run for one year for a fixed recurring monthly fee in the case of network and on an hourly basis for technical resources (usage revenue). ZPS also generates revenue via telecommunication equipment sales.\nEvaluation and Preparation for Potential REIT Conversion\nOn May 3, 2018, we announced we completed the first phase of our investigation on the advisability and feasibility of a conversion to a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As part of the current phase of our evaluation and preparation for a potential conversion to a REIT, we began a direct dialogue with the IRS in an effort to obtain clarity and support for our position, and we are seeking a PLR from the IRS that addresses, among other things, whether our revenues from dark and lit fiber satisfy applicable REIT income tests. We submitted the PLR request to the IRS in July 2018, but the IRS may not provide a response until later in 2019 or beyond or may not respond at all. Our ultimate decision to convert to a REIT may depend upon a favorable PLR from the IRS.\nAlso, we have begun to execute various organizational changes that are required to operate as a REIT, including the adoption of amendments to our organizational documents that, among other things, impose certain stock ownership limitations and transfer restrictions, the realignment of our business segments to clearly delineate the leasing of network assets from ancillary services and, in particular, the separation and potential divestiture or deconsolidation of our Allstream business segment. These organizational changes are not expected to result in any changes to our reportable segments.\nIf, following the current phase of our evaluation and preparation, we decide to convert to a REIT and are successful in qualifying for taxation as a REIT, then we will generally be permitted to deduct from federal income taxes the dividends that we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends would not be subject to federal income taxation at the entity level but would be taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our domestic TRS, which will hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT-compliant, will be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through entities that are disregarded from us for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Also, we will be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally five years) following the REIT conversion that are attributable to built-in\u201d gains with respect to the assets that we own on the date we convert to a REIT.\nOur ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT will depend upon our compliance with various requirements following our REIT conversion, including requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to federal and state\nincome tax at regular corporate income tax rates in the same manner as we are currently taxed. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs described above, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.\nAt this stage of our evaluation and preparation for a potential conversion to a REIT, we cannot accurately estimate the costs required to support any potential conversion, but we anticipate that our costs would include various administrative costs in addition to certain related tax liabilities.\nSignificant Merger Development\nOn May 8, 2019, we, Parent and Merger Sub entered into a Merger Agreement to be acquired by the Consortium. Upon the close of the Merger, we will operate as a privately-held company. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by the Consortium.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into us in the Merger, with us as the surviving and continuing corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and (ii) at the effective time of the Merger, each of our outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub or held in our treasury, all of which shall be canceled without any consideration being exchanged therefore or shares of our Common Stock held by holders who have made a valid demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to $35.00 per share in cash.\nThe closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, (ii) the receipt of specified required regulatory approvals, (iii) the absence of any law or order enjoining or prohibiting the Merger or making it illegal, (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to material adverse effect\u201d and materiality qualifications) and (v) compliance with covenants in the Merger Agreement in all material respects. The closing of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition.\nOur board of directors and the board of directors of Parent have each unanimously approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement. On July 26, 2019, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders where our stockholders approved the adoption of the Merger Agreement. On July 31, 2019, the Company announced the early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, satisfying one of the conditions to the closing of the pending transaction The closing of the deal continues to be subject to customary conditions, including regulatory clearances relating to review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the receipt of certain foreign antitrust approvals, certain other foreign direct investment review approvals, and specified FCC and state public utility commission approvals. The closing of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. The Merger is expected to close in the first half of 2020. Until the closing, we will continue to operate as an independent company.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which has been filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe were founded in 2007 with the investment thesis of building a bandwidth infrastructure platform to take advantage of the favorable Internet, data, and wireless growth trends driving the ongoing demand for access to bandwidth infrastructure, and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the industry. These trends have continued in the years since our founding, despite volatile economic conditions, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on those trends. We have built a significant portion of our network and product offerings through 45 acquisitions through June 30, 2019.\nAs a result of the growth of our business from these acquisitions and the capital expenditures and increased debt used to fund those investing activities, our results of operations for the respective periods presented and discussed herein are not comparable.\nFiscal 2018 Acquisitions\nNeutral Path Communications\nOn April 17, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Neutral Path Communications and Near North Partners (collectively, Neutral Path\u201d) for $33.3 million, which is net of cash acquired and also included an estimate for a contingent payment based on sales performance through June 30, 2018. The all-cash acquisition was funded with cash on hand and was considered an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nNeutral Path is a long haul infrastructure provider, providing access to a fiber network section in the Midwest. The transaction added 452 owned route miles, plus additional leased route miles, to our extensive North American network, including a unique high-count fiber route from Minneapolis to Omaha. The fiber footprint augments our network with three owned diverse fiber routes out of Minneapolis, Chicago and Omaha.\nThe results of the acquired Neutral Path business are included in our operating results beginning April 17, 2018.\nMcLean Data Center\nOn April 4, 2018, we acquired McLean Data Center, a privately owned data center for an insignificant amount. The acquisition was considered an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes and a business combination for accounting purposes. The Company assumed an operating lease obligation and certain assets, such as cash, structural components, equipment and customer contracts equipment and customer contracts.\nSpread Networks\nOn February 28, 2018, we acquired Spread Networks, LLC ( Spread Networks\u201d), a privately-owned telecommunications provider that owns and offers access to a 825-mile, high-fiber count long haul route connecting New York and Chicago, for net purchase consideration of $130.5 million, net of cash acquired. The all-cash acquisition was funded with cash on hand and debt and was considered an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe route connects 755 Secaucus Road in Secaucus, New Jersey and 1400 Federal Boulevard in Carteret, New Jersey to 350 Cermak Road in Chicago, Illinois, with additional connectivity to be enabled by Zayo's existing network. Zayo plans to use the acquired assets to provide a low-latency wavelength route from Seattle to New York.\nThe results of the acquired Spread Networks business are included in our operating results beginning February 28, 2018.\nOptic Zoo Networks\nOn January 18, 2018, we acquired Vancouver, BC Canada-based Optic Zoo Networks for net purchase consideration of CAD $30.9 million (or $24.8 million), net of cash acquired. Optic Zoo Networks owns and provides access to high-capacity fiber in Vancouver. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and was considered a stock purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe transaction strengthens Zayo's position in Vancouver and Western Canada, adding 103 route miles and more than 100 on-net buildings to Zayo's Vancouver footprint.\nThe results of the acquired Optic Zoo Networks business are included in our operating results beginning January 18, 2018.\nDisposition\nScott-Rice Telephone Co.\nOn July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of Scott-Rice Telephone Co. ( SRT\u201d), a Minnesota incumbent local exchange carrier, for $42.2 million to Nuvera Communications, Inc. (formerly New Ulm Telecom, Inc.). As of June 30, 2019, $3.2 million of purchase consideration was held in escrow. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million on the sale, which is included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. We acquired SRT as part of our March 1, 2017 purchase of Electric Lightwave Parent, Inc. and it was included as part of the Allstream segment. SRT had a pre-tax net loss of $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 and pre-tax net income of $2.9 million from when it was acquired in March 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017.\nSummary of Business Acquisitions\nThe table below summarizes the dates and purchase prices (which are net of cash acquired and include assumption of debt and capital leases) of all acquisitions and asset purchases through June 30, 2019.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDate\n</td>

The weighted average interest rate on our senior secured revolving credit facility ( the Revolver\u201d) was approximately 4.2% as of June 30, 2019. The interest rate on the Revolver was approximately 3.8% as of June 30, 2018, and there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver as of such date. As of June 30, 2019, $145.0 million was outstanding under the Revolver. Standby letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of $8.5 million as of June 30, 2019, leaving $296.5 million available under the Revolver, subject to certain conditions.\nSubstantial Capital Expenditures\nDuring Fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we invested $786.9 million, $789.9 million, and $835.5 million, respectively, in capital expenditures primarily to expand our fiber network to support new customer contracts. We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures in future periods.\nBackground for Review of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is comprised predominately of monthly recurring revenue ( MRR\u201d). MRR is related to an ongoing offering that is generally fixed in price and paid by the customer on a monthly basis. We also report monthly amortized revenue ( MAR\u201d), which represents the amortization of previously collected upfront charges to customers. Upfront charges are typically related to indefeasible rights of use ( IRUs\u201d) structured as pre-payments rather than monthly recurring payments (though we structure IRUs as both prepaid and recurring, largely dependent on the customers' preference) and installation fees. The last category of revenue we report is other revenue. Usage revenue represents charges to customers for variable contracts. Other revenue primarily includes credits and adjustments, termination revenue, construction contribution payments, and component sales.\nOur consolidated reported revenue in any given period is a function of our beginning revenue under contract and the impact of organic growth and acquisition activity. Our organic activity is driven by net new sales ( bookings\u201d), gross installed revenue ( installs\u201d) and churn processed ( churn\u201d) as further described below.\nNet New Sales. Net new sales ( bookings\u201d) represent the dollar amount of orders, to be recorded as MRR and MAR upon installation, in a period that have been signed by the customer and accepted by our product offering delivery organization. The dollar value of bookings is equal to the monthly recurring price the customer will pay for the offerings and/or the monthly amortized amount of the revenue we will recognize for those offerings. To the extent a booking is cancelled by the customer prior to the offerings being originated, it is subtracted from the total bookings number in the period that it is cancelled. Bookings do not immediately impact revenue until the solutions are installed (gross installed revenue).\nGross Installed Revenue. Installs are the amount of MRR and MAR for offerings that have been installed, tested, accepted by the customer, and have been recognized in revenue during a given period. Installs include new offerings, price increases, and upgrades.\nChurn Processed. Churn is any negative change to MRR and MAR. Churn includes disconnects, negative price changes, and disconnects associated with upgrades or replacement offerings. For each period presented, disconnects associated with attrition and upgrades or replacement offerings are the drivers of churn, accounting for more than 75% of negative changes in MRR and MAR, while price changes account for less than 25%. Monthly churn is also presented as a percentage of MRR and MAR ( churn percentage\u201d).\nGiven the size and amount of acquisitions we have completed, we have estimated the revenue growth rate associated with our organic activity in each period reported. Our estimated organic growth rate is calculated as if acquisitions closed during the periods presented were closed on the first day of the earliest period presented within this Annual Report. In calculating this pro-forma growth figure, we add the revenue recorded by the acquired companies (including estimated purchase accounting adjustments) for the reporting periods prior to the date of inclusion in our results of operations, and then calculate the growth rate between the two reported periods. The estimated pro-forma revenue growth rates are not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisitions been consummated on the first day of the earliest period presented. As we conduct operations outside of the U.S. and have historically acquired companies with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar ( USD\u201d), the estimated pro-forma revenue growth rates may not adequately reflect operational performance as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe have foreign subsidiaries that enter into contracts with customers and vendors in currencies other than the USD-principally the British pound sterling ( GBP\u201d) and Canadian dollar ( CAD\u201d) and to a lesser extent the Euro. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenue and expenses each period. The comparisons excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates assume exchange rates remained constant at the comparative period rate.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOur operating costs and expenses consist of network expense ( Netex\u201d), compensation and benefits expenses, network operations expense ( Netops\u201d), stock-based compensation expense, other expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\nNetex consists of third-party network costs resulting from our leasing of certain network facilities, primarily leases of circuits and dark fiber, from third parties to augment our owned infrastructure, for which we are generally billed a fixed monthly fee. Netex also includes colocation facility costs for rent and license fees paid to the landlords of the buildings in which our colocation business operates, along with the utility costs to power those facilities. While increases in demand for our offerings will drive additional operating costs in our business, consistent with our strategy of leveraging our owned infrastructure assets, we expect to primarily utilize our existing network infrastructure or build new network infrastructure to meet the demand. In limited circumstances, we will augment our network with additional infrastructure or offerings from third-party providers. Third-party network costs include the upfront cost of the initial installation of such infrastructure. Such costs are included in operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations over the respective contract period.\nCompensation and benefits expenses include salaries, wages, incentive compensation and benefits. Employee-related costs that are directly associated with network construction and location installations (and development of business support systems) are capitalized and amortized to operating costs and expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses related to the departments attributed to generating revenue are included in our operating costs line item while compensation and benefits expenses related to the sales, product, and corporate departments are included in our selling, general and administrative expenses line item of our consolidated statements of operations.\nNetops expense includes all of the non-personnel related expenses of operating and maintaining our network infrastructure, including contracted maintenance fees, right-of-way costs, rent for cellular towers and other places where fiber is located, pole attachment fees, and relocation expenses. Such costs are included in operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations.\nStock-based compensation expense is included, based on the responsibilities of the awarded recipient, in either our operating costs or selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOther expenses include expenses such as property tax, franchise fees, colocation facility maintenance, travel, office expense and other administrative costs. Other expenses are included in both operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses depending on their relationship to generating revenue or association with sales and administration.\nTransaction costs include expenses associated with professional services (i.e. legal, accounting, regulatory, etc.) rendered in connection with acquisitions or disposals (including spin-offs), travel expense and severance expense incurred that are associated with acquisitions or disposals, and other direct expenses incurred that are associated with signed and/or closed acquisitions or disposals and unsuccessful acquisitions or disposals. Transaction costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nRefer to Item 6.

Our pro-forma revenue decline was primarily driven by churn that exceeded installs at our Allstream segment and by changes in exchange rates. The average exchange rate of the GBP against the USD weakened by 3.9%, the average exchange rate of the Euro against the USD weakened by 4.4%, and the average exchange rate of the CAD against the USD weakened by 4.1% during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. Normalizing our estimated pro-forma organic revenue to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we estimate that Fiscal 2019 pro-forma organic revenue would have decreased by $20.9 million compared to Fiscal 2018 pro forma organic revenue.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recognized net installs of $5.4 million as compared to $6.5 million during the year ended June 30, 2018, excluding Allstream.\nZayo Networks. Revenue from our Zayo Networks segment increased by $87.9 million, or 5%, to $1,896.7 million from $1,808.8 million, for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was primarily a result of organic growth.\nzColo. Revenue from our zColo segment decreased by $20.8 million, or 7%, to $269.9 million from $290.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The decrease was due to lower net installs.\nAllstream. Revenue from our Allstream segment decreased by $98.2 million, or 20%, to $381.7 million from $479.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The decrease was due to increased churn.\nOther. Revenue from our Other segment increased by $6.6 million, or 29%, to $29.7 million for Fiscal 2019 from $23.1 million for Fiscal 2018, respectively. The increase is attributable to an increase in component sales during Fiscal 2019.\nThe following table reflects the stratification of our revenues during these periods.

The increase is attributable to an increase in revenue associated with component sales.\nThe table below sets forth the components of our operating costs and expenses during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNetex\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n499.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n522.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(22.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCompensation and benefits expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n325.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n324.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNetwork operations expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n289.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n290.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n182.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n180.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n109.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n96.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n633.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n746.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(113.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,057.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,179.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(121.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\nNetex. Our Netex decreased by $22.3 million, or 4%, to $499.7 million for Fiscal 2019 from $522.0 million for Fiscal 2018. The decrease in Netex was primarily due to revenue churn in our Allstream segment.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $1.3 million to $325.9 million for Fiscal 2019 from $324.6 million for Fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily related to an increase in headcount for Fiscal 2019 over Fiscal 2018.\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses decreased by $0.9 million to $289.7 million for Fiscal 2019 from $290.6 million for Fiscal 2018. The decrease is primarily related to a slight reduction in network maintenance and restoration expenses.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses increased by $2.4 million, or 1%, to $182.7 million for Fiscal 2019, from $180.3 million for Fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily related to an increase in bad debt expense.\nTransaction Costs. Transaction costs decreased by $1.6 million, or 9%, to $17.0 million for Fiscal 2019 from $18.6 million for Fiscal 2018. Transaction costs decreased due to our decreased acquisition activity largely offset by transaction costs related to the Merger.\nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense increased by $12.6 million, or 13%, to $109.3 million for Fiscal 2019 from $96.7 million for Fiscal 2018. The increase is due to an increased number of grants in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $113.1 million, or 15%, to $633.4 million for Fiscal 2019 from $746.5 million for Fiscal 2018. The decrease is primarily attributable to a change in the estimated useful lives of fiber optic network assets from 20 years to 33 years, partially offset by depreciation from capital expenditures and our Fiscal 2018 acquisitions.\nTotal Other Expense, Net\nThe table below sets forth the components of our total other expense, net for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(338.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(299.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(38.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign currency (loss)/gain on intercompany loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(19.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other expenses, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(345.0)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(296.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(48.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased by $38.9 million, or 13%, to $338.7 million from $299.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in debt from the comparative period, which was primarily used to fund repurchases of our common stock, in addition to higher LIBOR rates.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was nil for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $4.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2018. The Fiscal 2018 loss on extinguishment of debt includes a non-cash expense associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and the issuance discounts on the portion of the Credit Agreement, as amended, that was deemed to have been extinguished as well as the portion extinguished through early prepayment. The loss on extinguishment of debt also includes certain fees paid to third parties involved in the second repricing of the Credit Agreement. See Note 7 - Long-term Debt to the consolidated financial statements.\nForeign currency gain/(loss) on intercompany loans. We recorded a foreign currency loss on intercompany loans of $14.1 million for Fiscal 2019, compared to $5.4 million gain for Fiscal 2018. During Fiscal 2019, we had intercompany loans between our U.S., UK and Canadian legal entities, which were established to fund our international acquisitions. As of June 30, 2019 our largest intercompany loans are denominated in GBP. Our Canadian intercompany loans were extinguished during Fiscal 2019. As the intercompany loans are recorded as an intercompany receivable at our U.S. entities, strengthening of the USD over a foreign currency results in a foreign currency loss on intercompany loans and the weakening of the USD over a foreign currency results in a gain on intercompany loans. The Fiscal 2019 non-cash loss was driven primarily by the strengthening of the USD compared to the GBP period-over-period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased over the prior year by $1.9 million, or 8% to $25.3 million for Fiscal 2019, from $23.4 million for Fiscal 2018. Our provision for income tax included both the current provision and a provision for deferred income tax expense resulting from timing differences between tax and financial reporting accounting bases.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted a tax bill, H.R.1, An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018, previously known as Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( U.S. Tax Reform\u201d). U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, created a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and changed business-related deductions and credits.\nU.S. Tax Reform had a material impact on the comparison of our effective tax rate and the expected income tax expense at the statutory rate for Fiscal 2018 as compared with Fiscal 2019.\nThe following table reconciles our expected tax provision based on the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate applied to our earnings before income tax to our actual provision for income taxes:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nApplicable statutory rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected provision at the statutory rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease/(decrease) due to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in statutory tax rate, outside U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in uncertain tax benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign tax rate differential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nU.S. Tax Reform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in valuation allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(38.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(49.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.6)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23.4\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective tax rate for Fiscal 2019 was positively impacted by reversing the valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rate was negatively impacted by increasing the uncertain tax benefit reserve. Prior period amounts were reclassified for comparability with the Fiscal 2019 presentation.\nSome U.S. Tax Reform provisions became effective during Fiscal 2019. As of June 30, 2019, the following provisions are not expected to have a material impact on tax expense: Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax, and the interest expense limitations. The executive compensation limitations had an impact and are included in stock compensation on the rate reconciliation. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of U.S. Tax Reform as more information and guidance becomes available.\nYear Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2017\nRevenue\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment and consolidated revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nZayo Networks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,808.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,621.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n187.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nzColo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n290.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n263.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllstream\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n479.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n314.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n165.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,602.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,220.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n382.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenue increased by $382.2 million, or 17%, to $2,602.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2018, from $2,220.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017. The increase in revenue was driven by our Fiscal 2018 and 2017 acquisitions as well as organic growth.\nWe estimate that the period-over-period pro-forma organic revenue growth was approximately 0.2%. Our pro-forma revenue growth was primarily driven by net installs over the course of both periods as a result of the continued strong demand for bandwidth infrastructure access broadly across our network territory and our customer verticals partially offset by changes in exchange rates. The average exchange rate of the GBP against the USD strengthened by 6%, the average exchange rate of the Euro against the USD strengthened by 9%, and the average exchange rate of the CAD against the USD strengthened by 5% during the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2017. Normalizing our estimated pro-forma organic revenue growth to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we estimate that Fiscal 2018 pro-forma organic revenue would have been negatively impacted by $32.3 million.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized net installs of $6.5 million as compared to $7.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2017, excluding Allstream.\nZayo Networks. Revenue from our Zayo Networks segment increased by $187.7 million, or 12%, to $1,808.8 million from $1,621.1 million, for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was a result of both organic and acquisition related growth.\nzColo. Revenue from our zColo segment increased by $27.4 million, or 10%, to $290.7 million from $263.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was a result of both organic and acquisition related growth.\nAllstream. Revenue from our Allstream segment increased by $165.6 million, or 53%, from $314.3 million to $479.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The increase was primarily a result of acquiring Electric Lightwave on March 1, 2017.\nOther. Revenue from our Other segment increased by $1.5 million, or 7%, to $23.1 million from $21.6 million, for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Other segment represented approximately 1% of our total revenue during the year ended June 30, 2018.\nThe following table reflects the stratification of our revenues during these periods.

The increase was directly attributed to an increase in revenue associated with component sales.\nThe table below sets forth the components of our operating costs and expenses during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNetex\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n522.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n437.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCompensation and benefits expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n324.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n273.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNetwork operations expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n290.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n244.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n180.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n147.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTransaction costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(9) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n96.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n114.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n746.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n606.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n140.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,179.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,844.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n335.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNetex. Our Netex increased by $84.4 million, or 19%, to $522.0 million for Fiscal 2018 from $437.6 million for Fiscal 2017. The increase in Netex was primarily due to our Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 acquisitions, partially offset by cost savings, as planned network related synergies were realized.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $50.8 million, or 19%, to $324.6 million for Fiscal 2018 from $273.8 million for Fiscal 2017. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses reflected the increase in average headcount for Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 largely due to employees added through the Electric Lightwave acquisition in March 2017.\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses increased by $45.9 million, or 19%, to $290.6 million for Fiscal 2018 from $244.7 million for Fiscal 2017. The increase principally reflected the organic and inorganic growth of our network assets and the related expenses of operating that expanded network. The increase principally reflected the organic and inorganic growth of our network assets and the related expenses of operating that expanded network. Our total network route miles increased 4% to approximately 129,000 miles at June 30, 2018 from approximately 124,000 miles at June 30, 2017.\nOther Expenses. Other expenses increased by $32.9 million, or 22%, to $180.3 million for Fiscal 2018, from $147.4 million for Fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily the result of additional expenses attributable to our Fiscal 2018 and 2017 acquisitions.\nTransaction Costs. Transaction costs decreased by $1.9 million, or 9%, to $18.6 million for Fiscal 2018 from $20.5 million for Fiscal 2017. The transaction costs recorded during the periods relate to direct costs associated with our Fiscal 2018 and 2017 acquisitions.\nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense decreased by $17.4 million, or 15%, to $96.7 million for Fiscal 2018 from $114.1 million for Fiscal 2017. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was\nprimarily driven by the remaining tranches of our pre-IPO common unit grants becoming fully vested during our 2017 fiscal year and by a decrease in the number of Part B awards granted.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $140.3 million, or 23%, to $746.5 million for Fiscal 2018 from $606.2 million for Fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily a result of depreciation related to increased capital expenditures and increased depreciation and amortization expense associated with our Fiscal 2018 and 2017 acquisitions, including $18.6 million resulting from recording revised fair value estimates of intangible assets and property and equipment associated with the Electric Lightwave acquisition, of which $6.2 million relates to previous reporting periods.\nTotal Other Expense, Net\nThe table below sets forth the components of our total other expense, net for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(299.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(241.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(58.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(18.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign currency gain/(loss) on intercompany loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(296.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(269.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(27.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Not meaningful\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased by $58.3 million, or 24%, to $299.8 million from $241.5 million for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in debt from the comparative period resulting from incremental debt raised to fund our acquisitions in addition to increasing LIBOR rates.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $4.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $18.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2017. The Fiscal 2018 loss on extinguishment of debt includes a non-cash expense associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and the issuance discounts on the portion of the Credit Agreement, as amended, that was deemed to have been extinguished as well as the portion extinguished through early prepayment. The loss on extinguishment of debt also includes certain fees paid to third parties involved in the second repricing of the Credit Agreement. See Note 7 - Long-term Debt to the consolidated financial statements.\nForeign currency gain/(loss) on intercompany loans. We recorded a foreign currency gain on intercompany loans of $5.4 million for Fiscal 2018, compared to a $10.3 million loss for Fiscal 2017. We have intercompany loans between our U.S., UK and Canadian legal entities, which were established to fund our international acquisitions. As the loans are recorded as an intercompany receivable at our U.S. entities, strengthening of the USD over a foreign currency results in a foreign currency loss on intercompany loans and the weakening of the USD over a foreign currency results in a gain on intercompany loans. This non-cash gain was driven by the strengthening of the USD over the GBP period-over-period and the related impact on intercompany loans entered into by foreign subsidiaries with functional currency in GBP.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased over the prior year by $4.2 million, or 22% to $23.4 million for Fiscal 2018, from $19.2 million for Fiscal 2017. Our provision for income tax included both the current provision and a provision for deferred income tax expense resulting from timing differences between tax and financial reporting accounting bases.\nU.S. Tax Reform has a material impact on the comparison of our effective tax rate and the expected income tax expense at the statutory rate for Fiscal 2018 as compared to Fiscal 2017.\nThe following table reconciles our expected tax provision based on the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate applied to our earnings before income tax to our actual provision for income taxes, prior period amounts were reclassified for comparability with the Fiscal 2019 presentation:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nApplicable statutory rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected provision at the statutory rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease/(decrease) due to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in statutory tax rate, outside U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in uncertain tax benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign tax rate differential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.9)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nU.S. Tax Reform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in valuation allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(49.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10.2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n23.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19.2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings/(loss) from operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) adjusted to exclude acquisition or disposal-related transaction costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains/(losses) on intercompany loans, gains/(losses) on business dispositions and non-cash income/(loss) on equity and cost method investments. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting for future periods. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and facilitates comparison of our results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures.\nWe also monitor Adjusted EBITDA because our subsidiaries have debt covenants that restrict their borrowing capacity that are based on a leverage ratio, which utilizes a modified EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding Notes. The modified EBITDA is consistent with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA; however, it includes the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of and expected cost synergies from the companies acquired by us during the quarter for which the debt compliance certification is due.\nAdjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are also utilized by management and our compensation committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). For example, Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndoes not reflect capital expenditures, or future requirements for capital and major maintenance

Our principal uses of cash have been for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, debt service requirements and repurchases of our common stock. We anticipate our principal uses of cash in the future will be for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service.\nWe have financial covenants under the indentures governing the 6.00% senior unsecured notes due 2023, the 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025, the 5.75% Senior Notes due 2027 and our amended and restated credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility and revolving credit facility that, under certain circumstances, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. The indentures governing the Notes limit any increase in ZGL's\nsecured indebtedness (other than certain forms of secured indebtedness expressly permitted under such indentures) to a pro forma secured debt ratio of 4.50 times ZGL's previous quarter's annualized modified EBITDA (as defined in the indentures), and limit ZGL's incurrence of additional indebtedness to a total indebtedness ratio of 6.00 times the previous quarter's annualized modified EBITDA. The Credit Agreement also contains a covenant, applicable only to the Revolver, that ZGL maintain a senior secured leverage ratio below 5.25:1.00 at any time when the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the Revolver is greater than 35% of the commitments under the Revolver. The Credit Agreement also requires ZGL and its subsidiaries to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants restricting the ability of ZGL and its subsidiaries, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness, make additional guaranties, incur additional liens on assets, or dispose of assets, pay dividends, or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay certain other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments and amend the terms of certain other indebtedness. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including among others, non-payment of principal, interest, or other amounts when due, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, breach of covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, insolvency or inability to pay debts, bankruptcy, or a change of control.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had $186.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $158.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held in bank accounts and highly-liquid U.S. treasury money market funds. We have a current deferred revenue balance of $174.9 million that we will be recognizing as revenue over the next twelve months. The actual cash outflows associated with fulfilling this deferred revenue obligation during the next twelve months will be significantly less than the June 30, 2019 current deferred revenue balance. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we drew $275.0 million under our Revolver and paid down $130.0 million. As of June 30, 2019, we had $296.5 million available under our Revolver, subject to certain conditions. Accordingly, we believe we have sufficient resources to fund our obligations and foreseeable liquidity requirements in the near term and for the foreseeable future.\nOur capital expenditures decreased by $3.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018, to $786.9 million from $789.9 million. Although we had a slight decrease in the period, we expect to continue to invest in our network for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2019, we were contractually committed for $471.1 million of capital expenditures for construction materials and purchases of property and equipment. A majority of these capital expenditure commitments are expected to be satisfied in the next twelve months. These capital expenditures, however, are expected to primarily be success-based; that is, in most situations, we will not invest the capital until we have an executed customer contract that supports the investment. For more information on our contractual commitments refer to our Contractual Cash Obligations table below.\nAs part of our corporate strategy, we continue to be regularly involved in discussions regarding potential acquisitions of companies and assets, some of which may be quite large. We expect to fund such acquisitions with cash from operations, debt issuances (including available borrowings under our $450.0 million Revolver), equity offerings, and available cash on hand. We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business, repay our debt obligations, and support our other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. As market conditions permit, we may refinance existing debt, issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets, or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity.\nCash Flows\nWe believe our cash flows from operating activities, in addition to cash and cash equivalents currently on-hand, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, and in any event for at least the next 12 to 18 months. Given the generally volatile global economic climate, no assurance can be given that this will be the case.\nWe regularly consider acquisitions and additional strategic opportunities, including large acquisitions, which may require additional debt or equity financing.\nThe following table sets forth components of our cash flow for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n951.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n971.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n909.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(747.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(966.8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,270.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in)/provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(275.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,411.3\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by $20.1 million to $951.1 million from $971.2 million during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2019 include the net income of $150.0 million, plus the add backs of non-cash items deducted in the determination of net income, principally depreciation and amortization of $633.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of $109.3 million, deferred income taxes of $1.2 million, foreign currency loss on intercompany loans of $14.1 million and non-cash interest expense of $10.3 million. Additions to deferred revenue of $193.1 million during the period were largely offset by amortization of deferred revenue of $152.1 million. Cash flow during the period was reduced by the net change in working capital components of $13.7 million.\nNet cash flows from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2018 include the net income of $102.9 million, plus the add backs of non-cash items deducted in the determination of net income, principally depreciation and amortization of $746.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $96.7 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.9 million, non-cash interest expense of $9.8 million, and the deferred tax expense of $22.3 million, partially offset by foreign currency gain on intercompany loans of $5.4 million. Also contributing to the cash provided by operating activities were additions to deferred revenue of $212.8 million, less amortization of deferred revenue of $136.3 million. Cash flow during the period was reduced by the net change in working capital components of $89.0 million.\nThe decrease in net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily a result of lower revenues and increased cash paid for interest, net of capitalized interest.\nNet cash flows from operating activities increased by $61.4 million to $971.2 million from $909.8 million during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNet cash flows from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2017 include the net income of $87.1 million, plus the add backs of non-cash items deducted in the determination of net income, principally depreciation and amortization of $606.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $114.1 million, foreign currency loss on intercompany loans of $10.3 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $18.2 million, non-cash interest expense of $9.6 million, and the deferred tax expense of $13.4 million. Also contributing to the cash provided by operating activities were additions to deferred revenue of $200.5 million, less amortization of deferred revenue of $116.5 million. Cash flow during the period was reduced by the net change in working capital components of $37.9 million.\nThe increase in net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2017 is primarily a result of additional earnings from organic growth and synergies realized from our Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 acquisitions.\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019, our principal use of cash for investing activities was $786.9 million in additions to property and equipment. This was partially offset by $39.0 million in proceeds from the sale of SRT, net of cash held in escrow.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2018, our principal uses of cash for investing activities were $789.9 million in additions to property and equipment and $176.9 million in net cash paid for acquisitions.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2017, our principal uses of cash for investing activities were $835.5 million in additions to property and equipment and $1,434.8 million in net cash paid for acquisitions, largely driven by our acquisition of Electric Lightwave.\nCash Flows (Used in)/Provided By Financing Activities\nOur cash flows used for financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2019 are primarily comprised of $402.5 million in purchases of our common stock, $130.0 million in payments on the Revolver, $6.2 million in capital lease payments, $5.0 million in principal payments on our long-term debt, $3.8 million in payments on the Santa Clara acquisition financing agreement, $2.0 million for other financing outflows and $0.7 million in payments for debt issuance costs. These movements were offset by $275.0 million in borrowings under the Revolver.\nOur cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2018 are primarily comprised of $462.8 million in debt proceeds, net of discounts, related to the issuance of $300 million incremental 5.75% Senior Unsecured Note due 2027 and an additional $150 million tranche of the Company's existing term loan. These proceeds were partially offset by $310.7 million for the partial pre-payment of the Company's term loan, $93.5 million cash paid for stock repurchases, $8.4 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations, $5.3 million related to payments for the Santa Clara acquisition financing arrangement and other, $5.0 million of scheduled principal payments on our term loan, and $4.3 million in payment of debt issuance costs.\nOur cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2017 are primarily comprised of $3,865.8 million in debt proceeds from the refinancing of our term loan and our $650 million Electric Lightwave Incremental Term Loan, net of discounts, and our aggregate $1,350.0 million issuances of 2027 Unsecured Notes, net of premiums, partially offset by $2,408.8 million of principal payments and early pre-payment on long-term debt, $6.6 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations, and $35.4 million in payment of debt issuance costs.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table represents a summary of our estimated future payments under contractual cash obligations as of June 30, 2019 for continuing operations. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these future payments.\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2021 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2023 - 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt (principal and interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,633.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n324.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,236.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,183.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,889.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital leases (principal and interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n270.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n171.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n658.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n128.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n190.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n123.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n215.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nObligations for capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n471.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n471.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n348.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n83.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n124.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n82.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n56.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,382.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,027.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,592.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,429.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,333.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating leases and obligations for capital expenditures include expected payments for our operating facilities, network costs and capacity, structural components, communications equipment, and maintenance obligations. Our obligations for capital expenditures are primarily success-based, meaning that before we commit resources to expand our network, we have a signed customer contract that will provide us with an attractive return on the required capital. The contractual long-term debt payments, above, include an estimate of future interest expense based on the interest rates in effect on our floating rate debt obligations as of the most recent balance sheet date.\nCash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, which are reflected in our cash flows from operating activities, during the year ended June 30, 2019 were $315.2 million and represents 33.1% of our cash flows from\noperating activities. We also made cash payments related to principal payments on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $141.2 million, which are reflected in our cash flows used in financing activities, and represented 14.8% of our cash flows from operating activities during the period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging, or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements, (ii) disclosed in Note 14-Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, or in the Future Contractual Obligations table included above.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2018-02), which allows companies to reclassify the income tax effects resulting from tax bill H.R.1 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The standard also requires certain new disclosures regardless of the election. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal year ending June 30, 2020 Fiscal 2020\u201d for us), with early adoption permitted. We do not expect ASU 2018-02 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04), which simplifies the impairment testing for goodwill by changing the measurement for goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance, the recognition of an impairment charge is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, which could be different from the amount calculated under the current method using the implied fair value of the goodwill; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal year ending June 30, 2021 Fiscal 2021\u201d for us), with early adoption permitted. The provisions of ASU 2017-04 would not have affected our last goodwill impairment assessment, but no assurance can be provided that the simplified testing methodology will not affect our goodwill impairment assessment in the future.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The new guidance supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in Topic 840 and is intended to increase the transparency and comparability of accounting for lease transactions. ASU 2016-02 requires most leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Lessees will need to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current model but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606). ASU 2016-02 will require both quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 (Fiscal 2020 for us).\nASU 2016-02, as amended by ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using one of two modified retrospective approaches. An entity may choose to use either (1) the effective date or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements at the date of initial application. We will apply the transition requirements at the July 1, 2019 effective date by showing a cumulative effect adjustment in the first quarter of 2020, rather than restating any prior periods. In addition, we will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to contracts containing a lease, lease classification and initial direct lease costs. As an accounting policy election, we will exclude short-term leases (term of 12 months or less) from the balance sheet presentation and will account for non-lease and lease components in a contract as a single lease component for most asset classes. We also elected the land easements practical expedient which permits us to carry forward our historical accounting treatment for agreements existing on the adoption date.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new lease accounting system and related internal controls to meet the requirements of ASU 2016-02. While we are still evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated balance sheet, we expect to record significant right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities upon adoption. We do not expect our adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe have accounting policies that involve estimates such as the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue reserves, useful lives of long-lived assets, fair value of our restricted stock units issued as compensation, accruals for estimated tax and legal liabilities, accruals for exit activities associated with real estate leases, accruals for customer disputes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We have identified the policies below, which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations.\nRevenue\nRevenue is recognized at the amount probable to be collected, which includes billing and performance adjustments. During each reporting period, we make estimates for potential future credits to be issued in respect of current revenue related to performance interruptions and customer disputes, which are recorded as a reduction in revenue. We analyze historical credit activity when evaluating our credit reserve requirements. We reserve for known performance interruptions as incurred. We review customer disputes and reserve for those we believe to be valid claims, which is recorded as a reduction of revenue. The determination of the customer dispute credit reserve involves significant judgment, estimations and assumptions.\nWe defer recognition of revenue until cash is collected on certain components of revenue, principally contract termination charges and late fees, as collectability is not reasonably assured until receipt of the cash based on our historical experience.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for our stock-based compensation as either liability or equity awards based on the terms of the grant agreement. We account for forfeitures as they occur versus estimating forfeitures. We generally recognize stock-based awards to employees and independent directors based on their grant-date fair values, with no consideration for future forfeitures. We recognize the fair value of outstanding awards as a charge to operations over the vesting period.\nIn October 2014, we adopted the 2014 Performance Compensation Incentive Program ( PCIP\u201d). The PCIP includes incentive cash compensation and equity (in the form of restricted stock units or RSUs\u201d). Grants of RSUs under the PCIP plan are made quarterly for all participants. The PCIP went into effect on October 16, 2014.\nUnder the Part B component of the PCIP, participants, who include members of our senior management team, are awarded quarterly grants of RSUs. The number of the RSUs earned by the participants is based on our stock price performance over a four fiscal quarter measurement period, and Part B RSUs cliff vest based upon continued employment at the end of the measurement period. The existence of a vesting provision that is associated with the performance of our stock price is a market condition, which affects the determination of the grant date fair value. Upon vesting, RSUs convert to shares of our common stock.\nOur Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO\u201d) are also awarded quarterly grants of RSUs under the same provisions as other Part B participants outlined above. However, beginning with the grant during the three months ended December 31, 2018, in the case of the CEO, and beginning with the grant during the three months ended March 31, 2019, in the case of the CFO, awards are subject to additional vesting criteria that are based on our stock performance subsequent to the end of the measurement period. In order for the CEO and CFO to receive the maximum award, our stock price must remain at or above the ending measurement period price for the six months subsequent to the end of the performance period.\nThe grant date fair value of Part B awards issued during a given period are expensed over the performance period. The grant date fair value is estimated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation. This simulation estimates the ten-day average closing stock price ending on the vesting date, the stock price performance over the performance period, and the number of common shares to be issued at the vesting date. Various assumptions are utilized in the valuation method, including the target stock price performance ranges and respective share payout percentages, our historical stock price performance and volatility, peer companies' historical volatility and an appropriate risk-free rate. The aggregate future value of the grant under each simulation is calculated using the estimated per share value of the common stock at the end of the restriction period multiplied by the number of common shares projected to be granted at the vesting date. The present value of the aggregate grant is then calculated under each simulation resulting in a distribution of potential present values. The fair value is then calculated based on the average of the potential present values.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe record property and equipment acquired in connection with a business combination at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: Acquisitions-Purchase Price Allocation.\u201d Purchases of property and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred. Costs incurred prior to a capital project's completion are reflected as construction-in-progress and are part of network infrastructure assets. Depreciation begins once the property and equipment is available and ready for use. Certain internal direct labor costs of constructing or installing property and equipment are capitalized. Capitalized direct labor reflects a portion of the salary and benefits of certain field engineers and other employees that are directly related to the construction and installation of network infrastructure assets. We have contracted with third party contractors for the construction and installation of the majority of our fiber network. Interest costs are capitalized for all assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use. Depreciation and amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, with the exception of leasehold improvements, which are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease.\nWe perform periodic internal reviews to estimate useful lives of our property and equipment. Due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment, selecting the estimated economic life of telecommunications property and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment. Our internal reviews primarily consider industry benchmarking but also consider input from our network personnel regarding actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, and assumptions regarding the benefits and costs of implementing new technology that factor in the need to meet our financial objectives. We completed a review in March 2018 and revised our estimated useful lives for fiber optic network assets, from its previous estimate of a range of fifteen years to twenty years to a revised estimate of thirty-three years, and revised our estimated useful lives for owned buildings from its historical estimate of thirty-nine years to a revised estimate of forty-five years. In determining the change in estimated useful lives, management, with input from its engineering team, utilized quantitative and qualitative analysis, including historical usage patterns and retirements, industry benchmarks and review of published data sources. The change in estimated useful lives of the fiber optic network assets and owned buildings was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective March 1, 2018.\nEstimated useful lives of our property and equipment in years are as follows:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEstimated\nuseful\nlives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBuildings - leasehold and site improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15 to 45\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFurniture, fixtures and office equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComputer hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSoftware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nComponents, machinery and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 to 7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFiber optic components and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCircuit switch components and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPacket switch components and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFiber optic network\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConstruction in progress\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nN/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom time to time, we are required to replace or re-route existing fiber due to structural changes such as construction and highway expansions, which is defined as a relocation.\u201d In such instances, we fully depreciate the remaining carrying value of network infrastructure removed or rendered unusable, and capitalize the new fiber and associated construction costs of the relocation placed into service. To the extent that the relocation does not require the replacement of segments of our network, and only involves the act of moving our existing network infrastructure, as-is, to another location, the related costs are expensed as incurred.\nAt least annually we evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets and evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets. We consider various factors to determine if an impairment test is necessary. The factors include consideration of the overall economic climate, technological advances with respect to equipment, our strategy, and capital planning. Since our inception, no event has occurred nor has there been a change in the business environment that would trigger an impairment test for our property and equipment assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. This process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of such items.\nOur deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against taxable income in future years, deferred revenue and expenses recognized in our income statement but disallowed in our tax return until the associated cash flow occurs.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be recognized. The amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is influenced by management's assessment of our future taxable income with regard to relevant business plan forecasts, the reversal of deferred tax balances, and reasonable tax planning strategies. At each balance sheet date, existing assessments are reviewed and, if necessary, revised to reflect changed circumstances. In a situation where recent losses have been incurred, the relevant accounting standards require us to weight the objective evidence of the recent losses more heavily than subject evidence of projected taxable income. It is reasonably possible we may reverse the valuation allowance recorded on certain foreign subsidiaries' deferred tax assets in the near future.\nIn connection with several of our acquisitions, we have acquired significant U.S. NOLs. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the utilization of NOLs if there has been an ownership change\u201d as described in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nUpon acquiring a company that has NOLs, we prepare an assessment to determine if we have a legal right to use the acquired NOLs. In performing this assessment we follow the regulations within the Internal Revenue Code Section 382: Net Operating Loss Carryovers Following Changes in Ownership. Any disallowed NOLs acquired are written off in purchase accounting.\nA valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the period and/or of the character necessary to utilize the benefit of the deferred tax asset. When evaluating whether it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized, all available evidence, both positive and negative, that may affect the realizability of deferred tax assets is identified and considered in determining the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance. We continue to monitor our financial performance and other evidence each quarter to determine the appropriateness of our valuation allowance. If we are unable to meet our taxable income forecasts in future periods we may change our conclusion about the appropriateness of the valuation allowance, which could create a substantial income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations in the period such change occurs.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had $1,234.5 million of U.S. federal NOL carry forwards. We used approximately $406.9 million during Fiscal 2019 to offset increased profitability. We have completed several acquisitions in which we acquired net operating loss tax attributes as part of the purchase. These acquisitions, however, were considered a \"change in ownership\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and, as a result, such NOL carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation, reducing the amount available to offset income tax liabilities absent the limitation. Currently available U.S. NOL carry forwards as of June 30, 2019 are approximately $874.2 million. An additional $169.4 million will become available for use during fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Our NOL carryforwards, if not utilized to reduce taxable income in future periods, will expire in various amounts beginning in 2020 and ending in 2038. Of our $1,234.5 million NOL carry forwards balance, $1,045.2 million of these NOL carry forwards were acquired in acquisitions.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had approximately $345.9 million of foreign jurisdiction net operating loss carry forwards, primarily in Belgium and France. Some foreign NOLs have a valuation allowance reducing the value of the corresponding deferred tax asset in the financial statements due to recent losses. During fiscal year June 30, 2019, valuation allowances of $33.0 million were released in the United Kingdom as a result of corporate restructuring offering an enhanced ability to utilize those NOLs against future taxable income. It is reasonably possible that we may reverse the valuation allowance recorded on certain foreign subsidiaries' deferred tax assets in the near future.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had tax-effected state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $34.2 million, which are subject to limitations on their utilization and have various expiration dates beginning 2020 through 2038. We believe $32.1 million of this balance will be utilized and have provided a valuation allowance for the remainder.\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangibles\nIntangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively customer relationships\u201d), are initially recorded at fair value. We amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of ten to twenty years using the straight-line method, as this method approximates the timing in which we expect to receive the benefit from the acquired customer relationship assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination.\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in April or whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nOur goodwill impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes\nconsideration of the overall financial performance of the reporting units, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity- and reporting unit-specific events. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates. If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds that fair value, up to but not exceeding the reporting unit's goodwill.\nOur impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves comparing the estimated fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. To the extent the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value, we will recognize an impairment loss for the difference.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We recorded no impairment charges for goodwill or intangibles during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nAcquisitions - Purchase Price Allocation\nThe application of acquisition accounting requires we make fair value determinations as of the applicable valuation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts, including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparables and discount rates, replacement costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from acquired deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may engage third-party valuation specialists who generally assist us in the fair value determination of identifiable assets such as customer relationships, property and equipment and any other significant assets or liabilities. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization and income tax expense or benefit that we report. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of Zayo Group Holdings, Inc.'s operations and financial condition, including business acquisitions, substantial indebtedness, and substantial capital expenditures.

Please see Significant Merger Development\u201d in the below Overview\u201d.\nOverview\nIntroduction\nWe are a large and growing provider of access to bandwidth infrastructure in the United States ( U.S.\u201d), Europe and Canada. Our products and offerings enable our customers' mission-critical, high-bandwidth applications, such as cloud-based computing, video, mobile, social media, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications. Our key products and offerings include leased dark fiber, fiber to cellular towers and small cell sites, dedicated wavelength connections, Ethernet, IP connectivity, cloud-based computing and storage products and other\nhigh-bandwidth offerings. We provide access to our bandwidth infrastructure and other offerings over a unique set of dense metro, regional, and long-haul fiber network sections and through our interconnect-oriented data center facilities. Our fiber network sections and data center facilities are critical components of the overall physical network architecture of the Internet and private networks. Our customer base includes some of the largest and most sophisticated users of bandwidth infrastructure, such as wireless service carriers; telecommunications service carriers; financial services companies; social networking, media, and web content companies; education, research, and healthcare institutions; and governmental agencies. We typically provide customers with access to our bandwidth infrastructure solutions for a fixed monthly recurring fee under contracts that vary between one and twenty or more years in length. We operate our business with a unique focus on capital allocation and financial performance with the ultimate goal of maximizing equity value for our stockholders. Our core values center on partnership, alignment, and transparency with our three primary constituent groups - employees, customers, and stockholders.\nOn October 22, 2014, we completed an initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of shares of our common stock, which were listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ZAYO\u201d. Prior to the IPO, we were a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC (\"CII\"). Our primary operating subsidiary is Zayo Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( ZGL\u201d), and we are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.\nOur fiscal year ends June 30 each year, and we refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as Fiscal 2019,\u201d the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 as Fiscal 2018,\u201d and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as Fiscal 2017.\u201d\nReportable Segments and our Strategic Product Groups\nWe use the management approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented. The management approach is based on the manner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance. With the continued increase in our scope and scale, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, our CODM, who is our Chief Executive Officer, implemented certain organizational changes to the management and operation of the business that directly impact how the CODM makes resource allocation decisions and manages the Company. The changes in structure had the impact of combining our legacy Fiber Solutions, Transport, and Enterprise Networks segments into a single new segment, Zayo Networks, and re-aligning our Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG from our legacy Enterprise Networks segment to our zColo segment. These changes to our existing reportable segments have been recast for all prior period financial and operating metrics presented in this Annual Report for comparability. Our four reportable segments are described below.\nZayo Networks. Our Zayo Networks segment provides access to bandwidth infrastructure. This includes our Fiber, Layer 2/3 and Transport solutions. Within the Fiber business, Zayo provides access to mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell). Our mobile infrastructure solutions permit direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites and mobile switching centers. Fiber solutions customers include carriers and other communication service providers, internet service providers, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises and other companies that have the expertise to run their own fiber optic networks or require interconnected technical space. The contract terms for fiber solutions customers tend to range from three to twenty or more years. Our Layer 2/3 line of business provides connectivity and telecommunications solutions to medium and large enterprises. Our offerings within Layer 2/3 include Ethernet, IP, Transit Offerings, Wide Area Networking products, Media Networks and CloudLink. Solutions range from point-to-point data connections to multi-site managed networks to international outsourced IT infrastructure environments. The contract terms for Layer 2/3 solutions tend to range from one to five years. Our Transport line of business provide access to lit communications bandwidth infrastructure using customer-accessed optronics to light the fiber and, and our customers pay for access based on the amount and type of bandwidth they require. We target customers who require a significant amount of bandwidth across their networks. Transport customers include carriers, content providers, financial services companies, healthcare, government entities, education institutions and other medium and large enterprises. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years.\nZayo Colocation ( zColo\u201d). The zColo segment provides data center and cloud infrastructure solutions to a broad range of enterprise, carrier, cloud and content customers. Our offerings within this segment include\nthe provision of colocation space, power and interconnection offerings in North America and Western Europe. Solutions range in size from single cabinet solutions to 1MW+ data center infrastructure environments. Our data centers also support networking components for the purpose of aggregating and accommodating customers' data, voice, internet and video traffic. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years. Our Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG is included in the zColo segment. The Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG combines private cloud, public cloud and managed offerings in order to provide its customers secure infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which enables on-demand scaling and virtual computing in hybrid environments.\nAllstream. The Allstream segment provides Cloud VoIP and Data Solutions. This includes a full range of local voice offerings allowing business customers to complete telephone calls in their local exchange, as well as make long distance, toll-free and related calls. Unified Communications is the integration of real-time communication services such as telephony (including Cloud-based IP telephony), instant messaging and video conferencing with non-real-time communication services, such as integrated voicemail and e-mail. Allstream also provides customers with comprehensive telecommunications services including Ethernet, and IP/MPLS VPN Solutions.\nOther. The Other segment is primarily comprised of Zayo Professional Services. ZPS provides network and technical resources to customers who wish to leverage the Company's expertise in designing, acquiring and maintaining a network. The contract terms typically run for one year for a fixed recurring monthly fee in the case of network and on an hourly basis for technical resources (usage revenue). ZPS also generates revenue via telecommunication equipment sales.\nEvaluation and Preparation for Potential REIT Conversion\nOn May 3, 2018, we announced we completed the first phase of our investigation on the advisability and feasibility of a conversion to a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As part of the current phase of our evaluation and preparation for a potential conversion to a REIT, we began a direct dialogue with the IRS in an effort to obtain clarity and support for our position, and we are seeking a PLR from the IRS that addresses, among other things, whether our revenues from dark and lit fiber satisfy applicable REIT income tests. We submitted the PLR request to the IRS in July 2018, but the IRS may not provide a response until later in 2019 or beyond or may not respond at all. Our ultimate decision to convert to a REIT may depend upon a favorable PLR from the IRS.\nAlso, we have begun to execute various organizational changes that are required to operate as a REIT, including the adoption of amendments to our organizational documents that, among other things, impose certain stock ownership limitations and transfer restrictions, the realignment of our business segments to clearly delineate the leasing of network assets from ancillary services and, in particular, the separation and potential divestiture or deconsolidation of our Allstream business segment. These organizational changes are not expected to result in any changes to our reportable segments.\nIf, following the current phase of our evaluation and preparation, we decide to convert to a REIT and are successful in qualifying for taxation as a REIT, then we will generally be permitted to deduct from federal income taxes the dividends that we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends would not be subject to federal income taxation at the entity level but would be taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our domestic TRS, which will hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT-compliant, will be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through entities that are disregarded from us for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Also, we will be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally five years) following the REIT conversion that are attributable to built-in\u201d gains with respect to the assets that we own on the date we convert to a REIT.\nOur ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT will depend upon our compliance with various requirements following our REIT conversion, including requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to federal and state\nincome tax at regular corporate income tax rates in the same manner as we are currently taxed. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs described above, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.\nAt this stage of our evaluation and preparation for a potential conversion to a REIT, we cannot accurately estimate the costs required to support any potential conversion, but we anticipate that our costs would include various administrative costs in addition to certain related tax liabilities.\nSignificant Merger Development\nOn May 8, 2019, we, Parent and Merger Sub entered into a Merger Agreement to be acquired by the Consortium. Upon the close of the Merger, we will operate as a privately-held company. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by the Consortium.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into us in the Merger, with us as the surviving and continuing corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and (ii) at the effective time of the Merger, each of our outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub or held in our treasury, all of which shall be canceled without any consideration being exchanged therefore or shares of our Common Stock held by holders who have made a valid demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to $35.00 per share in cash.\nThe closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, (ii) the receipt of specified required regulatory approvals, (iii) the absence of any law or order enjoining or prohibiting the Merger or making it illegal, (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to material adverse effect\u201d and materiality qualifications) and (v) compliance with covenants in the Merger Agreement in all material respects. The closing of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition.\nOur board of directors and the board of directors of Parent have each unanimously approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement. On July 26, 2019, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders where our stockholders approved the adoption of the Merger Agreement. On July 31, 2019, the Company announced the early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, satisfying one of the conditions to the closing of the pending transaction The closing of the deal continues to be subject to customary conditions, including regulatory clearances relating to review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the receipt of certain foreign antitrust approvals, certain other foreign direct investment review approvals, and specified FCC and state public utility commission approvals. The closing of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. The Merger is expected to close in the first half of 2020. Until the closing, we will continue to operate as an independent company.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which has been filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe were founded in 2007 with the investment thesis of building a bandwidth infrastructure platform to take advantage of the favorable Internet, data, and wireless growth trends driving the ongoing demand for access to bandwidth infrastructure, and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the industry. These trends have continued in the years since our founding, despite volatile economic conditions, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on those trends. We have built a significant portion of our network and product offerings through 45 acquisitions through June 30, 2019.\nAs a result of the growth of our business from these acquisitions and the capital expenditures and increased debt used to fund those investing activities, our results of operations for the respective periods presented and discussed herein are not comparable.\nFiscal 2018 Acquisitions\nNeutral Path Communications\nOn April 17, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Neutral Path Communications and Near North Partners (collectively, Neutral Path\u201d) for $33.3 million, which is net of cash acquired and also included an estimate for a contingent payment based on sales performance through June 30, 2018. The all-cash acquisition was funded with cash on hand and was considered an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nNeutral Path is a long haul infrastructure provider, providing access to a fiber network section in the Midwest. The transaction added 452 owned route miles, plus additional leased route miles, to our extensive North American network, including a unique high-count fiber route from Minneapolis to Omaha. The fiber footprint augments our network with three owned diverse fiber routes out of Minneapolis, Chicago and Omaha.\nThe results of the acquired Neutral Path business are included in our operating results beginning April 17, 2018.\nMcLean Data Center\nOn April 4, 2018, we acquired McLean Data Center, a privately owned data center for an insignificant amount. The acquisition was considered an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes and a business combination for accounting purposes. The Company assumed an operating lease obligation and certain assets, such as cash, structural components, equipment and customer contracts equipment and customer contracts.\nSpread Networks\nOn February 28, 2018, we acquired Spread Networks, LLC ( Spread Networks\u201d), a privately-owned telecommunications provider that owns and offers access to a 825-mile, high-fiber count long haul route connecting New York and Chicago, for net purchase consideration of $130.5 million, net of cash acquired. The all-cash acquisition was funded with cash on hand and debt and was considered an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe route connects 755 Secaucus Road in Secaucus, New Jersey and 1400 Federal Boulevard in Carteret, New Jersey to 350 Cermak Road in Chicago, Illinois, with additional connectivity to be enabled by Zayo's existing network. Zayo plans to use the acquired assets to provide a low-latency wavelength route from Seattle to New York.\nThe results of the acquired Spread Networks business are included in our operating results beginning February 28, 2018.\nOptic Zoo Networks\nOn January 18, 2018, we acquired Vancouver, BC Canada-based Optic Zoo Networks for net purchase consideration of CAD $30.9 million (or $24.8 million), net of cash acquired. Optic Zoo Networks owns and provides access to high-capacity fiber in Vancouver. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and was considered a stock purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe transaction strengthens Zayo's position in Vancouver and Western Canada, adding 103 route miles and more than 100 on-net buildings to Zayo's Vancouver footprint.\nThe results of the acquired Optic Zoo Networks business are included in our operating results beginning January 18, 2018.\nDisposition\nScott-Rice Telephone Co.\nOn July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of Scott-Rice Telephone Co. ( SRT\u201d), a Minnesota incumbent local exchange carrier, for $42.2 million to Nuvera Communications, Inc. (formerly New Ulm Telecom, Inc.). As of June 30, 2019, $3.2 million of purchase consideration was held in escrow. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million on the sale, which is included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. We acquired SRT as part of our March 1, 2017 purchase of Electric Lightwave Parent, Inc. and it was included as part of the Allstream segment. SRT had a pre-tax net loss of $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 and pre-tax net income of $2.9 million from when it was acquired in March 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017.\nSummary of Business Acquisitions\nThe table below summarizes the dates and purchase prices (which are net of cash acquired and include assumption of debt and capital leases) of all acquisitions and asset purchases through June 30, 2019.\n\nWe completed each of the acquisitions described above, with the exception of Voicepipe and Corelink, with cash raised through combinations of equity issuances and the incurrence of debt. We acquired Voicepipe from certain existing CII equity holders in exchange for CII preferred units, and we acquired Corelink with a combination of cash and CII preferred units.\nSubstantial Indebtedness\nAs of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, long-term debt was as follows:\n\n (1) The most recent borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility occurred in January 2019 and the most recent amendment on the Revolving Loan Facility was in April 2019. \n (2) The earliest possible maturity date under the Extension Amendment No. 1 entered into on April 3, 2019. See Note 7 - Long-term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further details. \nThe weighted average interest rates (including margins) on the Term Loan Facility were approximately 4.6% and 4.3% at June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on our senior secured revolving credit facility ( the Revolver\u201d) was approximately 4.2% as of June 30, 2019. The interest rate on the Revolver was approximately 3.8% as of June 30, 2018, and there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver as of such date. As of June 30, 2019, $145.0 million was outstanding under the Revolver. Standby letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of $8.5 million as of June 30, 2019, leaving $296.5 million available under the Revolver, subject to certain conditions.\nSubstantial Capital Expenditures\nDuring Fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we invested $786.9 million, $789.9 million, and $835.5 million, respectively, in capital expenditures primarily to expand our fiber network to support new customer contracts. We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures in future periods.\nBackground for Review of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is comprised predominately of monthly recurring revenue ( MRR\u201d). MRR is related to an ongoing offering that is generally fixed in price and paid by the customer on a monthly basis. We also report monthly amortized revenue ( MAR\u201d), which represents the amortization of previously collected upfront charges to customers. Upfront charges are typically related to indefeasible rights of use ( IRUs\u201d) structured as pre-payments rather than monthly recurring payments (though we structure IRUs as both prepaid and recurring, largely dependent on the customers' preference) and installation fees. The last category of revenue we report is other revenue. Usage revenue represents charges to customers for variable contracts. Other revenue primarily includes credits and adjustments, termination revenue, construction contribution payments, and component sales.\nOur consolidated reported revenue in any given period is a function of our beginning revenue under contract and the impact of organic growth and acquisition activity. Our organic activity is driven by net new sales ( bookings\u201d), gross installed revenue ( installs\u201d) and churn processed ( churn\u201d) as further described below.\nNet New Sales. Net new sales ( bookings\u201d) represent the dollar amount of orders, to be recorded as MRR and MAR upon installation, in a period that have been signed by the customer and accepted by our product offering delivery organization. The dollar value of bookings is equal to the monthly recurring price the customer will pay for the offerings and/or the monthly amortized amount of the revenue we will recognize for those offerings. To the extent a booking is cancelled by the customer prior to the offerings being originated, it is subtracted from the total bookings number in the period that it is cancelled. Bookings do not immediately impact revenue until the solutions are installed (gross installed revenue).\nGross Installed Revenue. Installs are the amount of MRR and MAR for offerings that have been installed, tested, accepted by the customer, and have", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Our primary operating subsidiary is Zayo Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( ZGL\u201d), and we are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.\nOur fiscal year ends June 30 each year, and we refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 as Fiscal 2019,\u201d the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 as Fiscal 2018,\u201d and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as Fiscal 2017.\u201d\nReportable Segments and our Strategic Product Groups\nWe use the management approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented. The management approach is based on the manner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance. With the continued increase in our scope and scale, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, our CODM, who is our Chief Executive Officer, implemented certain organizational changes to the management and operation of the business that directly impact how the CODM makes resource allocation decisions and manages the Company. The changes in structure had the impact of combining our legacy Fiber Solutions, Transport, and Enterprise Networks segments into a single new segment, Zayo Networks, and re-aligning our Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG from our legacy Enterprise Networks segment to our zColo segment. These changes to our existing reportable segments have been recast for all prior period financial and operating metrics presented in this Annual Report for comparability. Our four reportable segments are described below.\nZayo Networks. Our Zayo Networks segment provides access to bandwidth infrastructure. This includes our Fiber, Layer 2/3 and Transport solutions. Within the Fiber business, Zayo provides access to mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell). Our mobile infrastructure solutions permit direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites and mobile switching centers. Fiber solutions customers include carriers and other communication service providers, internet service providers, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises and other companies that have the expertise to run their own fiber optic networks or require interconnected technical space. The contract terms for fiber solutions customers tend to range from three to twenty or more years. Our Layer 2/3 line of business provides connectivity and telecommunications solutions to medium and large enterprises. Our offerings within Layer 2/3 include Ethernet, IP, Transit Offerings, Wide Area Networking products, Media Networks and CloudLink. Solutions range from point-to-point data connections to multi-site managed networks to international outsourced IT infrastructure environments. The contract terms for Layer 2/3 solutions tend to range from one to five years. Our Transport line of business provide access to lit communications bandwidth infrastructure using customer-accessed optronics to light the fiber and, and our customers pay for access based on the amount and type of bandwidth they require. We target customers who require a significant amount of bandwidth across their networks. Transport customers include carriers, content providers, financial services companies, healthcare, government entities, education institutions and other medium and large enterprises. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years.\nZayo Colocation ( zColo\u201d). The zColo segment provides data center and cloud infrastructure solutions to a broad range of enterprise, carrier, cloud and content customers. Our offerings within this segment include\nthe provision of colocation space, power and interconnection offerings in North America and Western Europe. Solutions range in size from single cabinet solutions to 1MW+ data center infrastructure environments. Our data centers also support networking components for the purpose of aggregating and accommodating customers' data, voice, internet and video traffic. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years. Our Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG is included in the zColo segment. The Cloud and Cybersecurity SPG combines private cloud, public cloud and managed offerings in order to provide its customers secure infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which enables on-demand scaling and virtual computing in hybrid environments.\nAllstream. The Allstream segment provides Cloud VoIP and Data Solutions. This includes a full range of local voice offerings allowing business customers to complete telephone calls in their local exchange, as well as make long distance, toll-free and related calls. Unified Communications is the integration of real-time communication services such as telephony (including Cloud-based IP telephony), instant messaging and video conferencing with non-real-time communication services, such as integrated voicemail and e-mail. Allstream also provides customers with comprehensive telecommunications services including Ethernet, and IP/MPLS VPN Solutions.\nOther. The Other segment is primarily comprised of Zayo Professional Services. ZPS provides network and technical resources to customers who wish to leverage the Company's expertise in designing, acquiring and maintaining a network. The contract terms typically run for one year for a fixed recurring monthly fee in the case of network and on an hourly basis for technical resources (usage revenue). ZPS also generates revenue via telecommunication equipment sales.\nEvaluation and Preparation for Potential REIT Conversion\nOn May 3, 2018, we announced we completed the first phase of our investigation on the advisability and feasibility of a conversion to a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As part of the current phase of our evaluation and preparation for a potential conversion to a REIT, we began a direct dialogue with the IRS in an effort to obtain clarity and support for our position, and we are seeking a PLR from the IRS that addresses, among other things, whether our revenues from dark and lit fiber satisfy applicable REIT income tests. We submitted the PLR request to the IRS in July 2018, but the IRS may not provide a response until later in 2019 or beyond or may not respond at all. Our ultimate decision to convert to a REIT may depend upon a favorable PLR from the IRS.\nAlso, we have begun to execute various organizational changes that are required to operate as a REIT, including the adoption of amendments to our organizational documents that, among other things, impose certain stock ownership limitations and transfer restrictions, the realignment of our business segments to clearly delineate the leasing of network assets from ancillary services and, in particular, the separation and potential divestiture or deconsolidation of our Allstream business segment. These organizational changes are not expected to result in any changes to our reportable segments.\nIf, following the current phase of our evaluation and preparation, we decide to convert to a REIT and are successful in qualifying for taxation as a REIT, then we will generally be permitted to deduct from federal income taxes the dividends that we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends would not be subject to federal income taxation at the entity level but would be taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our domestic TRS, which will hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT-compliant, will be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through entities that are disregarded from us for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Also, we will be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally five years) following the REIT conversion that are attributable to built-in\u201d gains with respect to the assets that we own on the date we convert to a REIT.\nOur ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT will depend upon our compliance with various requirements following our REIT conversion, including requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to federal and state\nincome tax at regular corporate income tax rates in the same manner as we are currently taxed. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs described above, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.\nAt this stage of our evaluation and preparation for a potential conversion to a REIT, we cannot accurately estimate the costs required to support any potential conversion, but we anticipate that our costs would include various administrative costs in addition to certain related tax liabilities.\nSignificant Merger Development\nOn May 8, 2019, we, Parent and Merger Sub entered into a Merger Agreement to be acquired by the Consortium. Upon the close of the Merger, we will operate as a privately-held company. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by the Consortium.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into us in the Merger, with us as the surviving and continuing corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and (ii) at the effective time of the Merger, each of our outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub or held in our treasury, all of which shall be canceled without any consideration being exchanged therefore or shares of our Common Stock held by holders who have made a valid demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to $35.00 per share in cash.\nThe closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, (ii) the receipt of specified required regulatory approvals, (iii) the absence of any law or order enjoining or prohibiting the Merger or making it illegal, (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to material adverse effect\u201d and materiality qualifications) and (v) compliance with covenants in the Merger Agreement in all material respects. The closing of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition.\nOur board of directors and the board of directors of Parent have each unanimously approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement. On July 26, 2019, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders where our stockholders approved the adoption of the Merger Agreement. On July 31, 2019, the Company announced the early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, satisfying one of the conditions to the closing of the pending transaction The closing of the deal continues to be subject to customary conditions, including regulatory clearances relating to review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the receipt of certain foreign antitrust approvals, certain other foreign direct investment review approvals, and specified FCC and state public utility commission approvals. The closing of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. The Merger is expected to close in the first half of 2020. Until the closing, we will continue to operate as an independent company.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which has been filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe were founded in 2007 with the investment thesis of building a bandwidth infrastructure platform to take advantage of the favorable Internet, data, and wireless growth trends driving the ongoing demand for access to bandwidth infrastructure, and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the industry. These trends have continued in the years since our founding, despite volatile economic conditions, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on those trends. We have built a significant portion of our network and product offerings through 45 acquisitions through June 30, 2019.\nAs a result of the growth of our business from these acquisitions and the capital expenditures and increased debt used to fund those investing activities, our results of operations for the respective periods presented and discussed herein are not comparable.\nFiscal 2018 Acquisitions\nNeutral Path Communications\nOn April 17, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Neutral Path Communications and Near North Partners (collectively, Neutral Path\u201d) for $33.3 million, which is net of cash acquired and also included an estimate for a contingent payment based on sales performance through June 30, 2018. The all-cash acquisition was funded with cash on hand and was considered an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nNeutral Path is a long haul infrastructure provider, providing access to a fiber network section in the Midwest. The transaction added 452 owned route miles, plus additional leased route miles, to our extensive North American network, including a unique high-count fiber route from Minneapolis to Omaha. The fiber footprint augments our network with three owned diverse fiber routes out of Minneapolis, Chicago and Omaha.\nThe results of the acquired Neutral Path business are included in our operating results beginning April 17, 2018.\nMcLean Data Center\nOn April 4, 2018, we acquired McLean Data Center, a privately owned data center for an insignificant amount. The acquisition was considered an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes and a business combination for accounting purposes. The Company assumed an operating lease obligation and certain assets, such as cash, structural components, equipment and customer contracts equipment and customer contracts.\nSpread Networks\nOn February 28, 2018, we acquired Spread Networks, LLC ( Spread Networks\u201d), a privately-owned telecommunications provider that owns and offers access to a 825-mile, high-fiber count long haul route connecting New York and Chicago, for net purchase consideration of $130.5 million, net of cash acquired. The all-cash acquisition was funded with cash on hand and debt and was considered an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe route connects 755 Secaucus Road in Secaucus, New Jersey and 1400 Federal Boulevard in Carteret, New Jersey to 350 Cermak Road in Chicago, Illinois, with additional connectivity to be enabled by Zayo's existing network. Zayo plans to use the acquired assets to provide a low-latency wavelength route from Seattle to New York.\nThe results of the acquired Spread Networks business are included in our operating results beginning February 28, 2018.\nOptic Zoo Networks\nOn January 18, 2018, we acquired Vancouver, BC Canada-based Optic Zoo Networks for net purchase consideration of CAD $30.9 million (or $24.8 million), net of cash acquired. Optic Zoo Networks owns and provides access to high-capacity fiber in Vancouver. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and was considered a stock purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe transaction strengthens Zayo's position in Vancouver and Western Canada, adding 103 route miles and more than 100 on-net buildings to Zayo's Vancouver footprint.\nThe results of the acquired Optic Zoo Networks business are included in our operating results beginning January 18, 2018.\nDisposition\nScott-Rice Telephone Co.\nOn July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of Scott-Rice Telephone Co. ( SRT\u201d), a Minnesota incumbent local exchange carrier, for $42.2 million to Nuvera Communications, Inc. (formerly New Ulm Telecom, Inc.). As of June 30, 2019, $3.2 million of purchase consideration was held in escrow. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $5.5 million on the sale, which is included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. We acquired SRT as part of our March 1, 2017 purchase of Electric Lightwave Parent, Inc. and it was included as part of the Allstream segment. SRT had a pre-tax net loss of $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 and pre-tax net income of $2.9 million from when it was acquired in March 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017.\nSummary of Business Acquisitions\nThe table below summarizes the dates and purchase prices (which are net of cash acquired and include assumption of debt and capital leases) of all acquisitions and asset

See Note 7 - Long-term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further details. \nThe weighted average interest rates (including margins) on the Term Loan Facility were approximately 4.6% and 4.3% at June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on our senior secured revolving credit facility ( the Revolver\u201d) was approximately 4.2% as of June 30, 2019. The interest rate on the Revolver was approximately 3.8% as of June 30, 2018, and there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver as of such date. As of June 30, 2019, $145.0 million was outstanding under the Revolver. Standby letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of $8.5 million as of June 30, 2019, leaving $296.5 million available under the Revolver, subject to certain conditions.\nSubstantial Capital Expenditures\nDuring Fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we invested $786.9 million, $789.9 million, and $835.5 million, respectively, in capital expenditures primarily to expand our fiber network to support new customer contracts. We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures in future periods.\nBackground for Review of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is comprised predominately of monthly recurring revenue ( MRR\u201d). MRR is related to an ongoing offering that is generally fixed in price and paid by the customer on a monthly basis. We also report monthly amortized revenue ( MAR\u201d), which represents the amortization of previously collected upfront charges to customers. Upfront charges are typically related to indefeasible rights of use ( IRUs\u201d) structured as pre-payments rather than monthly recurring payments (though we structure IRUs as both prepaid and recurring, largely dependent on the customers' preference) and installation fees. The last category of revenue we report is other revenue. Usage revenue represents charges to customers for variable contracts. Other revenue primarily includes credits and adjustments, termination revenue, construction contribution payments, and component sales.\nOur consolidated reported revenue in any given period is a function of our beginning revenue under contract and the impact of organic growth and acquisition activity. Our organic activity is driven by net new sales ( bookings\u201d), gross installed revenue ( installs\u201d) and churn processed ( churn\u201d) as further described below.\nNet New Sales. Net new sales ( bookings\u201d) represent the dollar amount of orders, to be recorded as MRR and MAR upon installation, in a period that have been signed by the customer and accepted by our product offering delivery organization. The dollar value of bookings is equal to the monthly recurring price the customer will pay for the offerings and/or the monthly amortized amount of the revenue we will recognize for those offerings. To the extent a booking is cancelled by the customer prior to the offerings being originated, it is subtracted from the total bookings number in the period that it is cancelled. Bookings do not immediately impact revenue until the solutions are installed (gross installed revenue).\nGross Installed Revenue. Installs are the amount of MRR and MAR for offerings that have been installed, tested, accepted by the customer, and have"}
