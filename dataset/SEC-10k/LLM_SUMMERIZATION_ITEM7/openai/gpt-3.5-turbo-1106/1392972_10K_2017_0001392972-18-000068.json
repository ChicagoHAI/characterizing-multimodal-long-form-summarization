Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nOverview\nPROS is a cloud software company powering the shift to modern commerce by helping companies create personalized and frictionless buying experiences for their customers. Fueled by artificial intelligence, machine learning and proven science, our solutions make it possible for companies to price, configure and sell their products and services in an omnichannel environment with speed, precision and consistency. Our customers benefit from decades of data science expertise infused into our industry solutions. We also provide professional services to implement our software solutions.\nExecutive Summary\nIn 2017, we reached several key milestones in our cloud transformation efforts while continuing to enable our customers to leverage our data science driven solutions to help them compete in modern commerce. In 2017, we returned to year-over-year revenue growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, our subscription revenue exceeded maintenance revenue for the first time, and we also generated positive free cash flow again. Other notable items for the year included:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Subscription revenue increased 59% in 2017 over 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recurring revenue, which consists of maintenance and subscription revenue, grew by 22% in 2017 over 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Annualized Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") was $160.6 million as of December 31, 2017, up 31% year-over-year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Extended PROS modern commerce leadership position in the travel industry by introducing shopping, pricing and merchandising solutions through the acquisition of Vayant Travel Technologies, Inc.

ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and any other GAAP measure as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. ARR is defined as contracted recurring revenue, including contracts with a future start date, together with annualized overage fees incurred above contracted minimum transactions, and excludes license agreements recognized as license revenue in accordance with GAAP. Total ARR as of December 31, 2017 was $160.6 million, up from $122.2 million as of December 31, 2016.\nCash used in operating activities was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a change in working capital as a result of a decrease in accrued payroll and other employee benefits, and an increase in our prepaid assets arising from payments for cloud infrastructure. We expect our operating activities to provide cash in future years as we accumulate more annual subscription accounts.\nFree cash flow is another key metric to assess the strength of our business. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined as net cash provided or used by operating activities, less additions to property, plant and equipment, purchases of other (non-acquisition-related) intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software development costs. We believe free cash flow may be useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the amount of cash generated by our business operations. Free cash flow use for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $29.5 million, compared to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash used in operating activities:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase of intangible asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized internal-use software development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,048\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,521\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Performance Summary\nRecurring revenue, which is comprised of our subscription and maintenance revenue, accounted for 77% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Total recurring revenue was $129.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $106.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $23.2 million, or 22%, as a result of the transition of our business toward subscription services.\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased approximately $15.5 million to $168.8 million from $153.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 10% increase. This increase in total revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of 59% in subscription revenue, which was expected as we continue to transition the business toward subscription services.\nTotal deferred revenue was $95.2 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $79.7 million as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $15.5 million, or 19%, primarily due to an increase in our subscription deferred revenue. Recurring deferred revenue, which includes both subscription and maintenance deferred revenue, was $80.3 million as of December 31, 2017 and increased 30% as compared to December 31, 2016.\nRevenue by geography\nThe following geographic information is presented for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. PROS categorizes geographic revenues based on the location of our customer's headquarters.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States of America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>51,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The rest of the world\n</td> <td>54,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions\nOn August 3, 2017, we acquired Vayant, a privately held company based in Sofia, Bulgaria, for total cash consideration, net of cash acquired, of approximately $34.1 million. Vayant is a cloud software company that provides advanced shopping, merchandising and inspirational travel solutions. The acquisition of Vayant strengthens our modern commerce solutions for the travel industry and positions us to deliver greater value to our travel customers through an end-to-end offer optimization solution designed to help travel companies deliver personalized offers and expanded choices that drive loyalty and growth.\nAcquisitions are an element of our long-term corporate strategy. We believe future acquisitions could strengthen our competitive position, enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, grow our revenues and increase our overall value.\nFinancing activities\nIn June 2017, we issued $106.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2047, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2017.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet together with expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing agreements that we have not yet been able, contractually, to invoice. Deferred revenue consists of billings made and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our services pursuant to contractual commitments under our existing customer agreements, and does not represent the total contract value of existing multi-year agreements. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider that future invoicing to be included in our non-cancelable backlog. As of December 31, 2017, we had backlog of approximately $275.6 million, as compared to backlog of approximately $215.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Approximately $154.7 million of our backlog as of December 31, 2017 was not reasonably expected to be recognized as revenue during fiscal year 2018.\nWe have aligned our backlog definition with the concepts and requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" (\"ASU 2014-09\") in anticipation of the upcoming adoption of the new revenue standard in the first quarter of 2018. Backlog previously reported as of December 31, 2016 was $251 million, which included assumptions around maintenance renewals.\nBacklog varies from period to period based upon the timing and duration of customer agreements and customer renewals, and changes in foreign currency fluctuations and therefore may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue to be recognized in any particular period.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017 the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d). The Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries. The provisions of the Act are not expected to have a significant impact on our effective tax rate due to the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset position in the U.S. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nKey factors and trends that have affected and we believe will continue to affect our operating results include:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cloud Transition. In 2015, we began our transition to a cloud business to help accelerate adoption of our solutions and drive recurring revenue. The implementation of this cloud strategy has resulted in more sales of subscription-based solutions and very few licenses since that time and we expect this trend to continue. This increase in the sales of subscription-based solutions has resulted in an increase in our subscription revenue, and deferred more of our revenue recognition to later periods than we experienced prior to 2015. We also expect that over time, additional sales of our cloud-based solutions will result in a decrease in our maintenance and support revenue, particularly as existing customers migrate from our on-premise solutions to our cloud solutions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>B2B Buying Preferences Driving Technology Adoption. B2B buyers are increasingly demanding the same type of buying experience that they enjoy as consumers. For example, buyers increasingly prefer to buy online when they have already decided what to buy, and often prefer not to interact with a sales representative as their primary source of research. In response, we believe that businesses are increasingly looking to modernize their sales process by adopting technologies which provide frictionless, real-time, and personalized experiences across sales channels. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help power these experiences with our machine learning and data science solutions that help provide dynamic, personalized offers and pricing with consistency across sales channels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued Investments. We are focused on creating awareness for our solutions, expanding our customer base and growing our recurring revenues. While we incurred losses in 2017, we believe our market is large and underpenetrated and therefore we intend to continue investing to grow our recurring revenue and support our long-term initiatives. We plan to continue to invest in product development to enhance our existing technologies and develop new applications and technologies. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our subscription offerings globally through investments in sales, marketing, cloud support, security and infrastructure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sales Mix Impacts Revenue Recognition Timing.

Where we determine the professional services do not have stand-alone value, we treat the transaction as a single element, the professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and the professional services revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement. If more of our professional services are determined not to have stand-alone value, this would result in a deferral of services revenue and services revenue recognized over a longer period of time, which would have a negative near-term financial impact.\nDescription of Key Components of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenues primarily from recurring revenue, which includes subscription and maintenance and support services. Recurring revenues accounted for 77% of our total revenue in 2017.\nSubscription services. Subscription services fees are generally recognized ratably as revenue over the customer contract term. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of two to five years and are non-cancellable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue.\nFor our subscription services that include professional services, we evaluate the nature and scope to determine if the professional services have stand-alone value. If we determine the professional services have stand-alone value, the subscription services are accounted for separately from the professional services and the subscription services revenue recognition commences when the customer has access to the application. If we determine the professional services do not have stand-alone value, we treat the transaction as a single element, the subscription services and professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement.\nMaintenance and support. Maintenance and support revenue includes post-implementation customer support provided to our customers who purchased perpetual software licenses and the right to unspecified software updates and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis. We recognize revenue from maintenance and support arrangements ratably over the period in which the services are provided.\nLicense. We derive our license revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses. License revenue is recognized either upon software delivery or together with the professional services over time using the percentage-of-completion method or completed contract method.\nProfessional services. Professional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis.\nFor our subscription services that include professional services, we evaluate the nature and scope to determine whether the professional services have stand-alone value. Professional services deemed to have stand-alone value are accounted for separately from subscription services and typically recognized as the services are performed. If we determine the professional services do not have stand-alone value, we treat the transaction as a single element, the professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and the professional services revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement.\nCost of revenue\nCost of subscription. Cost of subscription includes those costs related to supporting our subscription services, principally (a) personnel costs, which include our employees, third-party contractors and noncash share-based compensation expense, (b) expenses related to operating our cloud infrastructure, (c) amortization of capitalized software for internal use, and (d) an allocation of depreciation, amortization of intangibles, facilities and information technology (\"IT\") support costs, including data center costs, and other costs incurred in providing subscription services to our customers.\nCost of maintenance and support. Cost of maintenance and support consists largely of personnel related expenses and an allocation of depreciation, amortization of intangibles, facilities and IT support costs and other costs incurred in providing maintenance and support services to our customers.\nCost of license. Cost of license consists of third-party fees for our licensed software and an allocation of the amortization of intangibles.\nCost of services. Cost of services includes those costs related to professional services and implementation of our solutions, principally (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits, third-party contractors and noncash share-based compensation expense, (b) billable and non-billable travel, (c) amortization of capitalized software for internal use, and (d) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs incurred in providing professional services to our customers. Cost of providing professional services may vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including the amount of professional services required to implement and configure our solutions.\nOperating expenses\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses principally consist of (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits, third-party contractors, sales commissions related to selling and marketing personnel and noncash share-based compensation expense (b) sales and marketing programs such as lead generation programs, company awareness programs, conferences, hosting and participation in industry trade shows, and other sales and marketing programs, (c) travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, (d) amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets, and (e) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures for executive, accounting and finance, legal, IT and human resources support functions. General and administrative expenses principally consist of (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits, third-party contractors and noncash share-based compensation expense, (b) travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, (c) accounting, legal and other professional fees, and (d) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses principally consist of (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits and third-party contractors, which are comprised of software developers, scientists and product managers working on enhancements of existing solutions, the development of new solutions, scientific research, quality assurance and testing and noncash share-based compensation expense and (b) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs.\nResults of operations\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2017 with year ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue: Table 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance and support\n</td> <td>69,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total subscription, maintenance and support\n</td> <td>129,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License\n</td> <td>5,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,252\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services\n</td> <td>33,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription revenue. Subscription revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the number of subscriptions purchased by new and existing customers, with the total number of customers generating subscription revenue increasing by 36% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in subscription revenue also included $3.3 million from our acquisition of Vayant. We expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as we focus on subscription-based sales and phase out license offerings. We continued to invest in customer programs and initiatives which helped keep our attrition rate fairly consistent as compared to the prior year. Our ability to maintain consistent customer attrition rates will play a role in our ability to continue to grow our subscription revenue.\nMaintenance and support. The modest increase in maintenance and support revenue was principally a result of the timing of certain cash collections. While, we continued to invest in customer programs and initiatives which helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year, we expect that over time, our plan to sell fewer licenses and more cloud-based solutions will result in a decrease in our maintenance and support as existing customers migrate from our on-premise solutions to\nour cloud solutions. We also expect to increase our focus on migrating our legacy on-premises software customers to our latest cloud solutions in 2018, which if successful, would further decrease maintenance revenue.\nLicense revenue. License revenue decreased primarily due to the completion of several large perpetual license projects related to agreements executed prior to our cloud transition, and our strategy to sell fewer licenses and more subscription services, resulting in lower future license revenue and higher subscription services revenue.\nServices revenue. Services revenue declined primarily as a result of large customer implementations completed in 2016 and fewer similar large implementations completed in 2017. The decrease was also due to lower levels of professional services required on our new subscription sales as well as on certain subscription contracts where subscription and services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription because the professional services were deemed to not have stand-alone value. Services revenue varies from period to period depending on different factors, including the level of professional services required to implement our solutions, the timing of services revenue recognition on certain subscription contracts and any additional professional services requested by our customers during a particular period.\nCost of revenue and gross profit.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of subscription\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of maintenance and support\n</td> <td>11,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of subscription, maintenance and support\n</td> <td>39,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of license\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>28,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,314\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of subscription. Cost of subscription increased primarily as a result of a $9.7 million increase in infrastructure cost to support our current and anticipated subscription customer base, and includes $2.5 million related to the acquisition of Vayant. The remaining increase of $0.8 million was related to personnel cost to support our subscription customer base, which included $0.2 million related to the Vayant acquisition. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 54% for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCost of maintenance and support. The cost of maintenance and support declined primarily due to a decrease in personnel cost mainly due to efficiencies in employee related costs. Maintenance and support gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 83% and 80%, respectively.\nCost of license. Cost of license consists of third-party fees for licensed software and remained relatively consistent year-over-year. License gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 95% and 98%, respectively.\nCost of services. The decrease in cost of services was generally commensurate with our decline in services revenue, and was primarily attributable to decreases in both personnel cost for our software implementations of $2.7 million, and in overhead expenses of $0.6 million. Services gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 14% and 8%, respectively. Services gross profit percentages vary period to period depending on different factors, including the level of professional services required to implement our solutions, our effective man-day rates and the utilization of our professional services personnel. We plan to add additional employees in our professional services organization to support our anticipated growth in the number of customers purchasing our subscription services.\nGross profit. The increase in overall gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was principally attributable to an increase of 10% in total revenue as compared to the same period in 2016.\nOperating expenses:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>40,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>56,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related\n</td> <td>720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and marketing. Our personnel cost increased by $2.1 million primarily due to our continued investments in sales and marketing as we focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. This was partially offset by a decrease of $1.2 million in severance expense associated with the change in employment status of our former Chief Operating Officer in July 2016. In addition, there was an increase of $3.2 million in non-personnel cost, which included $1.1 million intangible amortization related to our acquisition of Vayant, an increase of $0.8 million for sales and marketing events, an increase of $0.7 million in travel expenses, an increase of $0.5 million of recruiting expense, and an increase of $0.1 million for facility and other overhead expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.1 million in noncash share-based compensation expense and $0.7 million of personnel and other general and administrative costs related to our acquisition of Vayant. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in our use of contract labor, a decrease of $0.4 million in other overhead expenses, and a decrease of $0.2 million in bad debt expense.\nResearch and development expenses. Personnel cost increased $3.4 million, which included $1.0 million related to our acquisition of Vayant. Personnel cost increased primarily due to our continued investment in headcount to develop new and improve existing technologies, partially offset by an $1.5 million increase in capitalized internal-use software development costs. The remaining increase of $1.3 million was attributable to non-personnel cost and related overhead expenses associated with higher personnel cost.\nAcquisition-related expenses. Acquisition-related expenses were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisting primarily of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees, and retention bonuses related to our acquisition and integration of Vayant.\nOther income (expense), net:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible debt interest and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,111\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConvertible debt interest and amortization.

Our income tax provisions in 2017 and 2016 only included foreign taxes and state taxes not based on pre-tax income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 0% and (1)%, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate of 34% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the increase in our valuation allowance of $5.9 million and $26.6 million, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017 the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of $74.2 million and $69.0 million, respectively. The increase was principally attributed to an additional valuation allowance recorded on our current year's tax loss and increases in our noncash share-based compensation of $39.9 million partially offset by a downward adjustment to our valuation allowance related to global tax reform of $34.0 million.\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2016 with year ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance and support\n</td> <td>68,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total subscription, maintenance and support\n</td> <td>106,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License\n</td> <td>11,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,902\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services\n</td> <td>34,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription revenue.

Our license revenue depends on the amount of perpetual licenses sold in the period, as well as the timing of revenue recognition. As a result of our cloud strategy, we sold fewer perpetual licenses and experienced a corresponding decrease in license revenue, which included a decrease of $13.2 million in license revenue recognized on a percentage of completion basis, and $7.7 million in license revenue recognized upon software delivery.\nServices revenue. Services revenue declined primarily as a result of several customer implementations completed in 2015 or early 2016 with significant professional services.

The decrease in overall gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was principally attributable to a decrease of 9% in total revenue and an increase of 3% in total cost of revenue as compared to the same period in 2015.\nOperating expenses:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>38,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>52,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,890\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,012\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and marketing expenses. The decrease in selling and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.7 million in noncash share-based compensation expense primarily related to the cancellation of certain equity awards associated with the change in employment status of our former Chief Operating Officer, a $2.8 million decrease in sales commissions as a result of capitalizing more sales commissions, a $1.5 million decrease in marketing event costs, a $1.3 million decrease in intangible amortization expense, a $1.2 million decrease in travel expenses and a $0.3 million decrease in other overhead expenses. The decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in personnel costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses remained overall unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, as a result of our specific efforts to control the growth and scale the capacity of our corporate overhead functions.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expense increased primarily as a result of an increase of $5.3 million in personnel costs due to higher headcount to support our current and future product development and an increase of $0.7 million of non-personnel cost and related overhead expenses associated with higher personnel cost.\nImpairment charges. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we recorded $2.9 million of impairment charges related to internally developed software. This impairment resulted from a reduction of projected cash flows for product groups based on revisions to our projections during the year and was recorded to reduce the carrying value to fair value. This reduction reflected changes to our plans for certain product groups in connection with changes in future product launches and support. We did not record an impairment charge in 2016.\nOther expense, net:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible debt interest and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,914\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(405\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(661\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConvertible debt interest and amortization. The convertible debt interest and amortization expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 related to coupon interest and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs attributable to our senior notes issued in December 2014 and mature in December 2019.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net decreased by $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the reduced impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the period.\nIncome tax provision:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) provision\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(269\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax (benefit) provision. Our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of foreign taxes and state taxes not based on loss before income tax provision.\nOur 2016 and 2015 effective tax rates had an unusual relationship to pretax loss from operations as a result of the presence of a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. Our income tax provisions in 2016 and 2015 only included foreign taxes and state taxes not based on pre-tax income, resulting in an effective tax rate of (1)% in both periods. The difference between the effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate of 34% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to the increase in our valuation allowance of $26.6 million and $20.9 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of $69.0 million and $44.3 million, respectively. The increase was principally attributed to an additional valuation allowance recorded on our current year's tax loss and increases in our noncash share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $160.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $100.0 million of working capital as compared to $118.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $76.9 million of working capital at December 31, 2016. In addition, we had zero and $16.0 million of short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows generated from operations and potential borrowings under our secured Credit Agreement (\"Revolver\") with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as agent for the lenders party thereto. In December 2014, we issued the 2019 Notes and in June 2017, we issued the 2047 Notes to supplement our overall liquidity position. Our material drivers or variants of operating cash flow are net income (loss), noncash expenses (principally share-based compensation, intangible amortization and amortization of\ndebt discount and issuance costs) and the timing of periodic invoicing and cash collections related to licenses, subscriptions and support for our software and related services. Our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors and the payments of our other liabilities. We generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances, including funds provided by the issuance of our Notes, funds available under our Revolver and our current estimates of future operating cash flows, will provide adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our operational requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and coupon payments for our Notes for the next twelve months. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, potential growth of our subscription services, future acquisitions we might undertake, and expansion into complementary businesses. If such need arises, we may raise additional funds through equity or debt financings.\nThe following table presents key components of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(22,346\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,404\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,424\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>90,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,684\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,554\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents (beginning of period)\n</td> <td>118,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents (end of period)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities\nCash used in operating activities in 2017 and 2016 was $25.3 million and $14.3 million, respectively, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $15.5 million in 2015. Cash used in operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation and changes in working capital, which is impacted by the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and the timing of collections from our customers, which is the largest source of operating cash. The $11.0 million decrease in net cash from operations as compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $13.8 million decrease in working capital as a result of a decrease in accrued payroll and other employee benefits, and an increase in our prepaid assets for advance payments on our cloud infrastructure.\nFor 2016, net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to a decrease in net cash from operations compared to 2015 mainly due to our transition to a cloud strategy as on-premise software sales were replaced with annual subscription services, and the net impact of working capital changes, primarily driven by reduced cash generated from accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in cash associated with deferred revenue.\nFor 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was primarily comprised of cash provided from net changes in working capital, including a $32.3 million decrease in accounts receivable due to higher collections, partially offset by our $65.8 million net loss and the net effect of non-cash items.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nCash used in investing activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $22.3 million, $25.4 million and $9.4 million, respectively. For 2017, net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to our acquisition of Vayant, partially offset by the cash inflow from the maturities of short-term investments. In addition, we incurred capitalized internal-use software development costs on our subscription service solutions of $2.8 million, capital expenditures of $1.3 million and we paid $0.1 million for an intangible (non-acquisition) asset.\nFor 2016 and 2015, net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of short-term investments and capital expenditures of $7.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively. During 2016, we also paid $2.0 million for a cost method investment, paid $1.6 million for an intangible (non-acquisition) asset and incurred capitalized internal-use software development costs on our subscription service solutions of $1.0 million.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\nCash provided by financing activities for 2017 was $90.7 million, compared with cash used in financing activities in 2016 and 2015 of $3.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively. For 2017, the total increase of $94.3 million in net cash provided\nby financing activities primarily consisted of the proceeds of $93.5 million from the issuance of our 2047 Notes, also higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plans of $5.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, partially offset by payment of $3.0 million of debt issuance cost on our 2047 Notes, an increase of $1.9 million in tax withholdings on vesting of employee share-based awards and payment of $0.2 million in debt issuance costs on the Revolver renewal.\nFor 2016 and 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of tax withholdings on vesting of employee share-based awards of $5.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively. During 2016 and 2015, we had proceeds from employee stock plans and the exercises of stock options of $2.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. For 2015, we also paid $1.3 million of contingent consideration related to the PROS France acquisition.\nStock repurchases\nIn August 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to $15.0 million of our common stock. No shares were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, $10.0 million remained available in the stock repurchase program. The repurchase of stock, if continued, will be funded primarily with existing cash balances. The timing of any repurchases will depend upon various factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the market price of our common stock and management's assessment of our liquidity and cash flow needs. For additional information on the stock repurchase program see \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\"\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Our principal commitments as of December 31, 2017 consist of obligations under operating leases and various service agreements. See Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes, including interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>9,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>20,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotes\nAs of December 31, 2017, our outstanding notes payable consist of the 2019 Notes and the 2047 Notes. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. At December 31, 2017, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $15.3 million for the remaining duration of the Notes.\nCovenants\nOur credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants which restrict our ability to, among other things, create liens, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, in each case subject to certain exclusions. In addition, our credit facility contains certain financial covenants which become effective in the event our liquidity falls below $50 million or upon the occurrence of an event of default. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit facility.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The complexity and judgment of our estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the application of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could affect the amounts of revenue, expenses, unbilled receivables and deferred revenue. Estimates are also used for, but not limited to, receivables, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of assets, depreciation, income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation, valuation of stock options, other current liabilities and accrued liabilities. Numerous internal and external factors can affect estimates. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, our use of estimates and the related disclosures with our Audit Committee.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue recognition\nWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services fees, professional services, the perpetual licensing of our software products and the associated software maintenance and support services.\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following criteria are met:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the service has been or is being provided to the customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>collection of the fee is reasonably assured; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription services revenue\nSubscription services revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our subscription contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts. Any revenue related to up-front activation or set-up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated period that the customer benefits from the related services. Direct and incremental costs related to up-front activation or set-up activities are capitalized until the date our service is made available and then expensed ratably over the estimated period that the customer benefits from the related services.\nFor our subscription services that include professional services, we determine whether the professional services have stand-alone value. Professional services deemed to have stand-alone value are accounted for separately from subscription services and the subscription services revenue recognition commences on the date that our subscription services are made available to the customer. If determined that the professional services do not have stand-alone value, the transaction is treated as a single element and the subscription services and professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and the subscription services and the professional services revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement.\nMaintenance and support revenue\nMaintenance and support revenue includes post-implementation customer support and the right to unspecified software updates and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis. We recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the period in which the services are provided. There are limited instances where we recognize maintenance and support revenue at the latter of when the services are provided and when payment is received based on our belief that collectability is not reasonably assured.\nLicense revenue\nWe derive the majority of our license revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize software licenses revenues upon software delivery, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nWe evaluate the nature and scope of professional services for each arrangement, and if we determine that the professional services revenue should not be accounted for separately from license revenue, the license revenue is recognized together with the professional services revenue using the percentage-of-completion method or completed contract method. The completed contract method is also used for contracts where there is a risk over final acceptance by the customer or for contracts that are short-term in nature.\nThe percentage-of-completion method is measured by the percentage of man-days incurred during the reporting period as compared to the estimated total man-days necessary for each contract for implementation of the software solutions. We believe that for each such project, man-days expended in proportion to total estimated man-days at completion represents the most reliable and meaningful measure for determining a project's progress toward completion. Under our fixed-fee arrangements, should a loss be anticipated on a contract, the full amount of the loss is recorded when the loss is determinable.\nWe also license software solutions under term license agreements that typically include maintenance during the license term. When maintenance is included for the entire term of the term license, there is no renewal rate and we have not established vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\") of fair value for the maintenance on term licenses. For term license agreements, revenue and the associated costs are deferred until the delivery of the solution and recognized ratably over the remaining license term.\nProfessional services revenue\nProfessional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis. Training revenues are recognized as the services are rendered.\nFor our subscription services that include professional services, we determine whether the professional services have stand-alone value. Professional services deemed to have stand-alone value are accounted for separately from subscription services and typically recognized as the services are performed. If determined that the professional services do not have stand-alone value, the transaction is treated as a single element, the professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and the professional services revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement.\nFor software license arrangements that include professional services, we determine whether the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software using factors such as: the nature of its software products; whether they are ready for use by the customer upon receipt; the nature of professional services; the availability of services from other vendors; whether the timing of payments for license revenue coincides with performance of services; and whether milestones or acceptance criteria exist that affect the realizability of the software license fee. For professional services considered essential to the functionality of the software, the license revenue is recognized together with the professional services revenue using the percentage-of-completion method or completed contract method. The completed contract method is also used for contracts where there is a risk over final acceptance by the customer or for contracts that are short-term in nature.\nMultiple element arrangements\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. In order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have stand-alone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have stand-alone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangement accounting guidance provides a hierarchy when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. VSOE of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a stand-alone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (\"TPE\") of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. If neither VSOE nor TPE exist for a deliverable, arrangements with multiple deliverables can be separated into discrete units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price (\"BESP\"). The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any. For transactions that only include software and software-related elements, we continue to account for such arrangements under the software revenue recognition standards which require us to establish VSOE of fair value to allocate arrangement consideration to multiple deliverables.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain software and nonsoftware elements such as our subscription services, we allocate revenue between the software and software related elements as a group and any nonsoftware elements based on a relative fair value allocation. We determine fair value for each deliverable using the selling price hierarchy described above and utilizing VSOE of fair value if it exists.\nWe apply the residual method to recognize revenue for the delivered elements in stand-alone software transactions. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration, less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements, typically maintenance, provided that VSOE of fair value exists for all undelivered elements. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately or, in the case of maintenance, substantive renewal rates for maintenance.\nRevenue that has been recognized, but for which we have not invoiced the customer, is recorded as unbilled receivables. Invoices that have been issued before revenue has been recognized are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nIn addition to our initial credit evaluations at the inception of arrangements, we regularly assess our ability to collect outstanding customer invoices. To do so, we make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that the collection of an outstanding customer receivable is not probable. We also analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience, customer creditworthiness, changes in customer payment history and industry concentration on an aggregate basis when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If any of these factors change, our estimates may also change, which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts.\nDeferred commissions\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered to be direct sales commissions when they are associated specifically with a non-cancellable subscription contract. Direct sales commissions are deferred when earned and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancellable subscription contract. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we deferred $4.0 million of commissions and we amortized $2.5 million to sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we deferred $4.3 million of commissions and we amortized $1.9 million to sales and marketing expenses. Total deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets were $6.3 million and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNoncash share-based compensation\nWe have three noncash share-based compensation plans, the 1999 equity incentive plan, the 2007 equity incentive plan, and the 2017 equity incentive plan which authorize the discretionary granting of various types of stock awards to key employees, officers, directors and consultants. Our 1999 equity incentive plan was terminated in March 2007 for purposes of granting any future equity awards. Our 2007 equity incentive plan was adopted in March 2007 and expired in March 2017. Our 2017 equity incentive plan was adopted in May 2017. We may provide noncash share-based compensation through the grant of: (i) restricted stock awards; (ii) restricted stock unit awards - time, performance and market-based (\"RSUs\"); (iii) stock options; (iv) stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"); (v) phantom stock; and (vi) performance awards, such as market stock units (\"MSUs\"). In February 2014, we granted inducement awards in an aggregate amount of up to 308,250 shares in accordance with NYSE Rule 303A.08. These inducement awards were in the form of RSUs and MSUs granted to our former Chief Operating Officer and RSUs granted to certain new employees in connection with our acquisitions of PROS France and SignalDemand, Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have granted stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and market stock units. RSUs granted include time-based and market-based awards in which the number of shares that vest are based upon attainment of target average per share closing price over a requisite trading period.\nNoncash share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe fair value of the RSUs (time-based and performance-based) is based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value and the derived service period of the market-based RSUs is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The model requires the use of a number of assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock, our risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Our expected volatility at the date of grant is based on our historical volatility over the performance period.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options and SARs using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires us to use significant judgment to make estimates regarding the expected life of the award, volatility of our stock price, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield of our stock over the life of the award. The expected life of the award is a historical weighted average of the expected lives of similar securities of comparable public companies. We estimate volatility using our historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards. The dividend yield assumption is based on our expectation of paying no dividends.\nAs we issue stock options and SARs, we evaluate the assumptions used to value our stock option awards and SARs. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, noncash share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned noncash share-based compensation expense. Future noncash share-based compensation expense and unearned noncash share-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees.\nWe estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited and recognize expense only for those awards that ultimately are expected to vest. Significant judgment is required in determining the adjustment to noncash share-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures. Noncash share-based compensation expense in a period could be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures.\nMSUs are performance-based awards that cliff vest based on our shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the Russell 2000 Index (\"Index\") over the three year periods ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, March 2, 2018, February 28, 2019, February 28, 2020 and October 9, 2020 (\"Performance Period\"), respectively. The MSUs vest on January 1, 2016, January 1, 2017, January 1, 2018, March 3, 2018, March 1, 2019, March 1, 2020 and October 9, 2020, respectively. The maximum number of shares issuable upon vesting is 200% of the MSUs initially granted based on the average price of our common stock relative to the Index during the Performance Period. We estimate the fair value of MSUs on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of fair value of the MSUs is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatilities of our stock and the Index, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Our expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of our stock and the Index over the Performance Period.\nWe record deferred tax assets for stock based compensation awards that will result in future deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in our income tax (expense) income.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $31.4 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to noncash share-based compensation arrangements for stock options, SARs, RSUs and MSUs granted. These costs will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes. We estimate separately our deferred tax assets, related valuation allowances, current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. At December 31, 2017, our deferred tax assets consisted primarily of temporary differences related to noncash share-based compensation, R&E tax credit carryforwards and net operating losses.\nWe review the realizability of our deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to our valuation allowances may be necessary. We continually perform an analysis related to the realizability of our deferred tax assets. As a result, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, we determine that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized. During 2017, there was not sufficient positive evidence to outweigh the current and historic negative evidence to determine that it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets would not be realized. Therefore, we continue to have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017.\nWe account for uncertain income tax positions recognized in our financial statements in accordance with the Income Tax Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"), issued by the FASB. This interpretation requires companies to use a prescribed model for assessing the financial recognition and measurement of all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in their tax returns. This guidance provides clarification on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. Please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nBusiness combinations\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. If the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds our purchase price, the excess is recognized as a gain.\nSignificant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, particularly acquired intangible assets. The valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business. Each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant.\nIf different assumptions are used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIntangible assets, goodwill and long-lived assets\nWhen we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase consideration is typically allocated to acquired technology and other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We estimate fair value primarily utilizing the market approach, which calculates fair value based on the market values of comparable companies or comparable transactions. The amounts allocated to acquired technology and other intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date. We amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line method or, if reliably determinable, the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from two to eight years.\nWe review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates. If these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life is changed, we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment as of November 30 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. When conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we use a three step process. The first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances. In performing this assessment, we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future financial performance of our reporting unit and future opportunities in the markets in which it operates. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment, we perform a second step for our reporting unit, consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This quantitative assessment requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit and compare the estimated fair value to its respective carrying value (including goodwill) as of the date of the impairment test. The third step, employed for our reporting unit if it fails the second step, is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "summary": "The MD&A report discusses PROS, a cloud software company focused on helping companies create personalized and frictionless buying experiences. In 2017, the company achieved several key milestones, including a return to year-over-year revenue growth, positive free cash flow, and the introduction of new innovations.

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nOverview\nPROS is a cloud software company powering the shift to modern commerce by helping companies create personalized and frictionless buying experiences for their customers. Fueled by artificial intelligence, machine learning and proven science, our solutions make it possible for companies to price, configure and sell their products and services in an omnichannel environment with speed, precision and consistency. Our customers benefit from decades of data science expertise infused into our industry solutions. We also provide professional services to implement our software solutions.\nExecutive Summary\nIn 2017, we reached several key milestones in our cloud transformation efforts while continuing to enable our customers to leverage our data science driven solutions to help them compete in modern commerce. In 2017, we returned to year-over-year revenue growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, our subscription revenue exceeded maintenance revenue for the first time, and we also generated positive free cash flow again. Other notable items for the year included:\n \u2022 Subscription revenue increased 59% in 2017 over 2016; \n \u2022 Recurring revenue, which consists of maintenance and subscription revenue, grew by 22% in 2017 over 2016; \n \u2022 Annualized Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") was $160.6 million as of December 31, 2017, up 31% year-over-year; \n \u2022 Extended PROS modern commerce leadership position in the travel industry by introducing shopping, pricing and merchandising solutions through the acquisition of Vayant Travel Technologies, Inc. (\"Vayant\") based in Sofia, Bulgaria; \n \u2022 Released numerous new innovations enabling modern commerce, including the introduction of Opportunity Detection, to help uncover trends in buying behavior and identify new sales opportunities, the introduction of Monet\u2122, PROS artificial intelligence analyst that delivers data science-driven insights in PROS solutions, and the launch of PROS next-generation Guidance solution, providing customers with an unprecedented level of transparency and self-service capabilities in the PROS cloud; \n \u2022 Attained ISO/IEC 27001: 2013 certification, underscoring our commitment to customers by achieving the industry's most rigorous requirements for cloud security, data privacy, governance, and compliance; and \n \u2022 Successfully completed a private offering of $106.3 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of convertible senior notes due 2047. \nARR is one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our overall business. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and any other GAAP measure as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. ARR is defined as contracted recurring revenue, including contracts with a future start date, together with annualized overage fees incurred above contracted minimum transactions, and excludes license agreements recognized as license revenue in accordance with GAAP. Total ARR as of December 31, 2017 was $160.6 million, up from $122.2 million as of December 31, 2016.\nCash used in operating activities was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a change in working capital as a result of a decrease in accrued payroll and other employee benefits, and an increase in our prepaid assets arising from payments for cloud infrastructure. We expect our operating activities to provide cash in future years as we accumulate more annual subscription accounts.\nFree cash flow is another key metric to assess the strength of our business. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined as net cash provided or used by operating activities, less additions to property, plant and equipment, purchases of other (non-acquisition-related) intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software development costs. We believe free cash flow may be useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the amount of cash generated by our business operations. Free cash flow use for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $29.5 million, compared to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash used in operating activities:\n\nFinancial Performance Summary\nRecurring revenue, which is comprised of our subscription and maintenance revenue, accounted for 77% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Total recurring revenue was $129.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $106.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $23.2 million, or 22%, as a result of the transition of our business toward subscription services.\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased approximately $15.5 million to $168.8 million from $153.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 10% increase. This increase in total revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of 59% in subscription revenue, which was expected as we continue to transition the business toward subscription services.\nTotal deferred revenue was $95.2 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $79.7 million as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $15.5 million, or 19%, primarily due to an increase in our subscription deferred revenue. Recurring deferred revenue, which includes both subscription and maintenance deferred revenue, was $80.3 million as of December 31, 2017 and increased 30% as compared to December 31, 2016.\nRevenue by geography\nThe following geographic information is presented for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. PROS categorizes geographic revenues based on the location of our customer's headquarters.\n\nAcquisitions\nOn August 3, 2017, we acquired Vayant, a privately held company based in Sofia, Bulgaria, for total cash consideration, net of cash acquired, of approximately $34.1 million. Vayant is a cloud software company that provides advanced shopping, merchandising and inspirational travel solutions. The acquisition of Vayant strengthens our modern commerce solutions for the travel industry and positions us to deliver greater value to our travel customers through an end-to-end offer optimization solution designed to help travel companies deliver personalized offers and expanded choices that drive loyalty and growth.\nAcquisitions are an element of our long-term corporate strategy. We believe future acquisitions could strengthen our competitive position, enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, grow our revenues and increase our overall value.\nFinancing activities\nIn June 2017, we issued $106.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2047, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2017.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet together with expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing agreements that we have not yet been able, contractually, to invoice. Deferred revenue consists of billings made and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our services pursuant to contractual commitments under our existing customer agreements, and does not represent the total contract value of existing multi-year agreements. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider that future invoicing to be included in our non-cancelable backlog. As of December 31, 2017, we had backlog of approximately $275.6 million, as compared to backlog of approximately $215.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Approximately $154.7 million of our backlog as of December 31, 2017 was not reasonably expected to be recognized as revenue during fiscal year 2018.\nWe have aligned our backlog definition with the concepts and requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" (\"ASU 2014-09\") in anticipation of the upcoming adoption of the new revenue standard in the first quarter of 2018. Backlog previously reported as of December 31, 2016 was $251 million, which included assumptions around maintenance renewals.\nBacklog varies from period to period based upon the timing and duration of customer agreements and customer renewals, and changes in foreign currency fluctuations and therefore may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue to be recognized in any particular period.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017 the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d). The Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries. The provisions of the Act are not expected to have a significant impact on our effective tax rate due to the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset position in the U.S. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nKey factors and trends that have affected and we believe will continue to affect our operating results include:\n \u2022 Cloud Transition. In 2015, we began our transition to a cloud business to help accelerate adoption of our solutions and drive recurring revenue. The implementation of this cloud strategy has resulted in more sales of subscription-based solutions and very few licenses since that time and we expect this trend to continue. This increase in the sales of subscription-based solutions has resulted in an increase in our subscription revenue, and deferred more of our revenue recognition to later periods than we experienced prior to 2015. We also expect that over time, additional sales of our cloud-based solutions will result in a decrease in our maintenance and support revenue, particularly as existing customers migrate from our on-premise solutions to our cloud solutions. \n \u2022 B2B Buying Preferences Driving Technology Adoption. B2B buyers are increasingly demanding the same type of buying experience that they enjoy as consumers. For example, buyers increasingly prefer to buy online when they have already decided what to buy, and often prefer not to interact with a sales representative as their primary source of research. In response, we believe that businesses are increasingly looking to modernize their sales process by adopting technologies which provide frictionless, real-time, and personalized experiences across sales channels. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help power these experiences with our machine learning and data science solutions that help provide dynamic, personalized offers and pricing with consistency across sales channels. \n \u2022 Continued Investments. We are focused on creating awareness for our solutions, expanding our customer base and growing our recurring revenues. While we incurred losses in 2017, we believe our market is large and underpenetrated and therefore we intend to continue investing to grow our recurring revenue and support our long-term initiatives. We plan to continue to invest in product development to enhance our existing technologies and develop new applications and technologies. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our subscription offerings globally through investments in sales, marketing, cloud support, security and infrastructure. \n \u2022 Sales Mix Impacts Revenue Recognition Timing. The mix of the software applications in which our customer subscribes can affect our financial performance in a given period due to our determination if the professional services have stand-alone value. Professional services deemed to have stand-alone value are accounted for separately from subscription \nservices and typically recognized as the services are performed. Where we determine the professional services do not have stand-alone value, we treat the transaction as a single element, the professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and the professional services revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement. If more of our professional services are determined not to have stand-alone value, this would result in a deferral of services revenue and services revenue recognized over a longer period of time, which would have a negative near-term financial impact.\nDescription of Key Components of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenues primarily from recurring revenue, which includes subscription and maintenance and support services. Recurring revenues accounted for 77% of our total revenue in 2017.\nSubscription services. Subscription services fees are generally recognized ratably as revenue over the customer contract term. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of two to five years and are non-cancellable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue.\nFor our subscription services that include professional services, we evaluate the nature and scope to determine if the professional services have stand-alone value. If we determine the professional services have stand-alone value, the subscription services are accounted for separately from the professional services and the subscription services revenue recognition commences when the customer has access to the application. If we determine the professional services do not have stand-alone value, we treat the transaction as a single element, the subscription services and professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement.\nMaintenance and support. Maintenance and support revenue includes post-implementation customer support provided to our customers who purchased perpetual software licenses and the right to unspecified software updates and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis. We recognize revenue from maintenance and support arrangements ratably over the period in which the services are provided.\nLicense. We derive our license revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses. License revenue is recognized either upon software delivery or together with the professional services over time using the percentage-of-completion method or completed contract method.\nProfessional services. Professional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis.\nFor our subscription services that include professional services, we evaluate the nature and scope to determine whether the professional services have stand-alone value. Professional services deemed to have stand-alone value are accounted for separately from subscription services and typically recognized as the services are performed. If we determine the professional services do not have stand-alone value, we treat the transaction as a single element, the professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and the professional services revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement.\nCost of revenue\nCost of subscription. Cost of subscription includes those costs related to supporting our subscription services, principally (a) personnel costs, which include our employees, third-party contractors and noncash share-based compensation expense, (b) expenses related to operating our cloud infrastructure, (c) amortization of capitalized software for internal use, and (d) an allocation of depreciation, amortization of intangibles, facilities and information technology (\"IT\") support costs, including data center costs, and other costs incurred in providing subscription services to our customers.\nCost of maintenance and support. Cost of maintenance and support consists largely of personnel related expenses and an allocation of depreciation, amortization of intangibles, facilities and IT support costs and other costs incurred in providing maintenance and support services to our customers.\nCost of license. Cost of license consists of third-party fees for our licensed software and an allocation of the amortization of intangibles.\nCost of services. Cost of services includes those costs related to professional services and implementation of our solutions, principally (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits, third-party contractors and noncash share-based compensation expense, (b) billable and non-billable travel, (c) amortization of capitalized software for internal use, and (d) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs incurred in providing professional services to our customers. Cost of providing professional services may vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including the amount of professional services required to implement and configure our solutions.\nOperating expenses\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses principally consist of (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits, third-party contractors, sales commissions related to selling and marketing personnel and noncash share-based compensation expense (b) sales and marketing programs such as lead generation programs, company awareness programs, conferences, hosting and participation in industry trade shows, and other sales and marketing programs, (c) travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, (d) amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets, and (e) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures for executive, accounting and finance, legal, IT and human resources support functions. General and administrative expenses principally consist of (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits, third-party contractors and noncash share-based compensation expense, (b) travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, (c) accounting, legal and other professional fees, and (d) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses principally consist of (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits and third-party contractors, which are comprised of software developers, scientists and product managers working on enhancements of existing solutions, the development of new solutions, scientific research, quality assurance and testing and noncash share-based compensation expense and (b) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs.\nResults of operations\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2017 with year ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue: \nSubscription revenue. Subscription revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the number of subscriptions purchased by new and existing customers, with the total number of customers generating subscription revenue increasing by 36% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in subscription revenue also included $3.3 million from our acquisition of Vayant. We expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as we focus on subscription-based sales and phase out license offerings. We continued to invest in customer programs and initiatives which helped keep our attrition rate fairly consistent as compared to the prior year. Our ability to maintain consistent customer attrition rates will play a role in our ability to continue to grow our subscription revenue.\nMaintenance and support. The modest increase in maintenance and support revenue was principally a result of the timing of certain cash collections. While, we continued to invest in customer programs and initiatives which helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year, we expect that over time, our plan to sell fewer licenses and more cloud-based solutions will result in a decrease in our maintenance and support as existing customers migrate from our on-premise solutions to\nour cloud solutions. We also expect to increase our focus on migrating our legacy on-premises software customers to our latest cloud solutions in 2018, which if successful, would further decrease maintenance revenue.\nLicense revenue. License revenue decreased primarily due to the completion of several large perpetual license projects related to agreements executed prior to our cloud transition, and our strategy to sell fewer licenses and more subscription services, resulting in lower future license revenue and higher subscription services revenue.\nServices revenue. Services revenue declined primarily as a result of large customer implementations completed in 2016 and fewer similar large implementations completed in 2017. The decrease was also due to lower levels of professional services required on our new subscription sales as well as on certain subscription contracts where subscription and services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription because the professional services were deemed to not have stand-alone value. Services revenue varies from period to period depending on different factors, including the level of professional services required to implement our solutions, the timing of services revenue recognition on certain subscription contracts and any additional professional services requested by our customers during a particular period.\nCost of revenue and gross profit.\n\nCost of subscription. Cost of subscription increased primarily as a result of a $9.7 million increase in infrastructure cost to support our current and anticipated subscription customer base, and includes $2.5 million related to the acquisition of Vayant. The remaining increase of $0.8 million was related to personnel cost to support our subscription customer base, which included $0.2 million related to the Vayant acquisition. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 54% for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCost of maintenance and support. The cost of maintenance and support declined primarily due to a decrease in personnel cost mainly due to efficiencies in employee related costs. Maintenance and support gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 83% and 80%, respectively.\nCost of license. Cost of license consists of third-party fees for licensed software and remained relatively consistent year-over-year. License gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 95% and 98%, respectively.\nCost of services. The decrease in cost of services was generally commensurate with our decline in services revenue, and was primarily attributable to decreases in both personnel cost for our software implementations of $2.7 million, and in overhead expenses of $0.6 million. Services gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 14% and 8%, respectively. Services gross profit percentages vary period to period depending on different factors, including the level of professional services required to implement our solutions, our effective man-day rates and the utilization of our professional services personnel. We plan to add additional employees in our professional services organization to support our anticipated growth in the number of customers purchasing our subscription services.\nGross profit. The increase in overall gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was principally attributable to an increase of 10% in total revenue as compared to the same period in 2016.\nOperating expenses:\n\nSelling and marketing. Our personnel cost increased by $2.1 million primarily due to our continued investments in sales and marketing as we focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. This was partially offset by a decrease of $1.2 million in severance expense associated with the change in employment status of our former Chief Operating Officer in July 2016. In addition, there was an increase of $3.2 million in non-personnel cost, which included $1.1 million intangible amortization related to our acquisition of Vayant, an increase of $0.8 million for sales and marketing events, an increase of $0.7 million in travel expenses, an increase of $0.5 million of recruiting expense, and an increase of $0.1 million for facility and other overhead expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.1 million in noncash share-based compensation expense and $0.7 million of personnel and other general and administrative costs related to our acquisition of Vayant. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in our use of contract labor, a decrease of $0.4 million in other overhead expenses, and a decrease of $0.2 million in bad debt expense.\nResearch and development expenses. Personnel cost increased $3.4 million, which included $1.0 million related to our acquisition of Vayant. Personnel cost increased primarily due to our continued investment in headcount to develop new and improve existing technologies, partially offset by an $1.5 million increase in capitalized internal-use software development costs. The remaining increase of $1.3 million was attributable to non-personnel cost and related overhead expenses associated with higher personnel cost.\nAcquisition-related expenses. Acquisition-related expenses were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisting primarily of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees, and retention bonuses related to our acquisition and integration of Vayant.\nOther income (expense), net:\n\nConvertible debt interest and amortization. Convertible debt interest and amortization expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 relates to coupon interest and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs attributable to our 2019 Notes and our 2047 Notes. The increase in convertible debt interest and amortization primarily relates to our 2047 Notes issued in June 2017.\nOther income (expense), net.

This increase in total revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of 59% in subscription revenue, which was expected as we continue to transition the business toward subscription services.\nTotal deferred revenue was $95.2 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $79.7 million as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $15.5 million, or 19%, primarily due to an increase in our subscription deferred revenue. Recurring deferred revenue, which includes both subscription and maintenance deferred revenue, was $80.3 million as of December 31, 2017 and increased 30% as compared to December 31, 2016.\nRevenue by geography\nThe following geographic information is presented for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Vayant is a cloud software company that provides advanced shopping, merchandising and inspirational travel solutions. The acquisition of Vayant strengthens our modern commerce solutions for the travel industry and positions us to deliver greater value to our travel customers through an end-to-end offer optimization solution designed to help travel companies deliver personalized offers and expanded choices that drive loyalty and growth.\nAcquisitions are an element of our long-term corporate strategy. We believe future acquisitions could strengthen our competitive position, enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, grow our revenues and increase our overall value.\nFinancing activities\nIn June 2017, we issued $106.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2047, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2017.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet together with expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing agreements that we have not yet been able, contractually, to invoice. Deferred revenue consists of billings made and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our services pursuant to contractual commitments under our existing customer agreements, and does not represent the total contract value of existing multi-year agreements. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider that future invoicing to be included in our non-cancelable backlog. As of December 31, 2017, we had backlog of approximately $275.6 million, as compared to backlog of approximately $215.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Approximately $154.7 million of our backlog as of December 31, 2017 was not reasonably expected to be recognized as revenue during fiscal year 2018.\nWe have aligned our backlog definition with the concepts and requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" (\"ASU 2014-09\") in anticipation of the upcoming adoption of the new revenue standard in the first quarter of 2018. Backlog previously reported as of December 31, 2016 was $251 million, which included assumptions around maintenance renewals.\nBacklog varies from period to period based upon the timing and duration of customer agreements and customer renewals, and changes in foreign currency fluctuations and therefore may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue to be recognized in any particular period.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017 the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d). The Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries. The provisions of the Act are not expected to have a significant impact on our effective tax rate due to the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset position in the U.S. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nKey factors and trends that have affected and we believe will continue to affect our operating results include:\n \u2022 Cloud Transition. In 2015, we began our transition to a cloud business to help accelerate adoption of our solutions and drive recurring revenue. The implementation of this cloud strategy has resulted in more sales of subscription-based solutions and very few licenses since that time and we expect this trend to continue. This increase in the sales of subscription-based solutions has resulted in an increase in our subscription revenue, and deferred more of our revenue recognition to later periods than we experienced prior to 2015. We also expect that over time, additional sales of our cloud-based solutions will result in a decrease in our maintenance and support revenue, particularly as existing customers migrate from our on-premise solutions to our cloud solutions. \n \u2022 B2B Buying Preferences Driving Technology Adoption. B2B buyers are increasingly demanding the same type of buying experience that they enjoy as consumers. For example, buyers increasingly prefer to buy online when they have already decided what to buy, and often prefer not to interact with a sales representative as their primary source of research. In response, we believe that businesses are increasingly looking to modernize their sales process by adopting technologies which provide frictionless, real-time, and personalized experiences across sales channels. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help power these experiences with our machine learning and data science solutions that help provide dynamic, personalized offers and pricing with consistency across sales channels. \n \u2022 Continued Investments. We are focused on creating awareness for our solutions, expanding our customer base and growing our recurring revenues. While we incurred losses in 2017, we believe our market is large and underpenetrated and therefore we intend to continue investing to grow our recurring revenue and support our long-term initiatives. We plan to continue to invest in product development to enhance our existing technologies and develop new applications and technologies. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our subscription offerings globally through investments in sales, marketing, cloud support, security and infrastructure. \n \u2022 Sales Mix Impacts Revenue Recognition Timing. The mix of the software applications in which our customer subscribes can affect our financial performance in a given period due to our determination if the professional services have stand-alone value. Professional services deemed to have stand-alone value are accounted for separately from subscription \nservices and typically recognized as the services are performed. Where we determine the professional services do not have stand-alone value, we treat the transaction as a single element, the professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and the professional services revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement. If more of our professional services are determined not to have stand-alone value, this would result in a deferral of services revenue and services revenue recognized over a longer period of time, which would have a negative near-term financial impact.\nDescription of Key Components of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenues primarily from recurring revenue, which includes subscription and maintenance and support services. Recurring revenues accounted for 77% of our total revenue in 2017.\nSubscription services. Subscription services fees are generally recognized ratably as revenue over the customer contract term. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of two to five years and are non-cancellable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue.\nFor our subscription services that include professional services, we evaluate the nature and scope to determine if the professional services have stand-alone value. If we determine the professional services have stand-alone value, the subscription services are accounted for separately from the professional services and the subscription services revenue recognition commences when the customer has access to the application. If we determine the professional services do not have stand-alone value, we treat the transaction as a single element, the subscription services and professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement.\nMaintenance and support. Maintenance and support revenue includes post-implementation customer support provided to our customers who purchased perpetual software licenses and the right to unspecified software updates and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis. We recognize revenue from maintenance and support arrangements ratably over the period in which the services are provided.\nLicense. We derive our license revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses. License revenue is recognized either upon software delivery or together with the professional services over time using the percentage-of-completion method or completed contract method.\nProfessional services. Professional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis.\nFor our subscription services that include professional services, we evaluate the nature and scope to determine whether the professional services have stand-alone value. Professional services deemed to have stand-alone value are accounted for separately from subscription services and typically recognized as the services are performed. If we determine the professional services do not have stand-alone value, we treat the transaction as a single element, the professional services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription services, and the professional services revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement.\nCost of revenue\nCost of subscription. Cost of subscription includes those costs related to supporting our subscription services, principally (a) personnel costs, which include our employees, third-party contractors and noncash share-based compensation expense, (b) expenses related to operating our cloud infrastructure, (c) amortization of capitalized software for internal use, and (d) an allocation of depreciation, amortization of intangibles, facilities and information technology (\"IT\") support costs, including data center costs, and other costs incurred in providing subscription services to our customers.\nCost of maintenance and support. Cost of maintenance and support consists largely of personnel related expenses and an allocation of depreciation, amortization of intangibles, facilities and IT support costs and other costs incurred in providing maintenance and support services to our customers.\nCost of license. Cost of license consists of third-party fees for our licensed software and an allocation of the amortization of intangibles.\nCost of services. Cost of services includes those costs related to professional services and implementation of our solutions, principally (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits, third-party contractors and noncash share-based compensation expense, (b) billable and non-billable travel, (c) amortization of capitalized software for internal use, and (d) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs incurred in providing professional services to our customers. Cost of providing professional services may vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including the amount of professional services required to implement and configure our solutions.\nOperating expenses\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses principally consist of (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits, third-party contractors, sales commissions related to selling and marketing personnel and noncash share-based compensation expense (b) sales and marketing programs such as lead generation programs, company awareness programs, conferences, hosting and participation in industry trade shows, and other sales and marketing programs, (c) travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, (d) amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets, and (e) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures for executive, accounting and finance, legal, IT and human resources support functions. General and administrative expenses principally consist of (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits, third-party contractors and noncash share-based compensation expense, (b) travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, (c) accounting, legal and other professional fees, and (d) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses principally consist of (a) personnel costs, which include our employees and employee benefits and third-party contractors, which are comprised of software developers, scientists and product managers working on enhancements of existing solutions, the development of new solutions, scientific research, quality assurance and testing and noncash share-based compensation expense and (b) an allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and other costs.\nResults of operations\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2017 with year ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue: Table 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance and support\n</td> <td>69,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total subscription, maintenance and support\n</td> <td>129,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License\n</td> <td>5,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,252\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services\n</td> <td>33,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,432\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription revenue. Subscription revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the number of subscriptions purchased by new and existing customers, with the total number of customers generating subscription revenue increasing by 36% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in subscription revenue also included $3.3 million from our acquisition of Vayant. We expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as we focus on subscription-based sales and phase out license offerings. We continued to invest in customer programs and initiatives which helped keep our attrition rate fairly consistent as compared to the prior year. Our ability to maintain consistent customer attrition rates will play a role in our ability to continue to grow our subscription revenue.\nMaintenance and support. The modest increase in maintenance and support revenue was principally a result of the timing of certain cash collections. While, we continued to invest in customer programs and initiatives which helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year, we expect that over time, our plan to sell fewer licenses and more cloud-based solutions will result in a decrease in our maintenance and support as existing customers migrate from our on-premise solutions to\nour cloud solutions. We also expect to increase our focus on migrating our legacy on-premises software customers to our latest cloud solutions in 2018, which if successful, would further decrease maintenance revenue.\nLicense revenue. License revenue decreased primarily due to the completion of several large perpetual license projects related to agreements executed prior to our cloud transition, and our strategy to sell fewer licenses and more subscription services, resulting in lower future license revenue and higher subscription services revenue.\nServices revenue. Services revenue declined primarily as a result of large customer implementations completed in 2016 and fewer similar large implementations completed in 2017. The decrease was also due to lower levels of professional services required on our new subscription sales as well as on certain subscription contracts where subscription and services revenue is deferred until the customer commences use of the subscription because the professional services were deemed to not have stand-alone value. Services revenue varies from period to period depending on different factors, including the level of professional services required to implement our solutions, the timing of services revenue recognition on certain subscription contracts and any additional professional services requested by our customers during a particular period.\nCost of revenue and gross profit.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total\nrevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of subscription\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of maintenance and support\n</td> <td>11,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of subscription, maintenance and support\n</td> <td>39,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of license\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>28,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,314\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of subscription. Cost of subscription increased primarily as a result of a $9.7 million increase in infrastructure cost to support our current and anticipated subscription customer base, and includes $2.5 million related to the acquisition of Vayant. The remaining increase of $0.8 million was related to personnel cost to support our subscription customer base, which included $0.2 million related to the Vayant acquisition. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 54% for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCost of maintenance and support. The cost of maintenance and support declined primarily due to a decrease in personnel cost mainly due to efficiencies in employee related costs. Maintenance and support gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 83% and 80%, respectively.\nCost of license. Cost of license consists of third-party fees for licensed software and remained relatively consistent year-over-year. License gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 95% and 98%, respectively.\nCost of services. The decrease in cost of services was generally commensurate with our decline in services revenue, and was primarily attributable to decreases in both personnel cost for our software implementations of $2.7 million, and in overhead expenses of $0.6 million. Services gross profit percentages for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 14% and 8%, respectively. Services gross profit percentages vary period to period depending on different factors, including the level of professional services required to implement our solutions, our effective man-day rates and the utilization of our professional services personnel. We plan to add additional employees in our professional services organization to support our anticipated growth in the number of customers purchasing our subscription services.\nGross profit. The increase in overall gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was principally attributable to an increase of 10% in total revenue as compared to the same period in 2016.\nOperating expenses:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>40,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>56,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related\n</td> <td>720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and marketing. Our personnel cost increased by $2.1 million primarily due to our continued investments in sales and marketing as we focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. This was partially offset by a decrease of $1.2 million in severance expense associated with the change in employment status of our former Chief Operating Officer in July 2016. In addition, there was an increase of $3.2 million in non-personnel cost, which included $1.1 million intangible amortization related to our acquisition of Vayant, an increase of $0.8 million for sales and marketing events, an increase of $0.7 million in travel expenses, an increase of $0.5 million of recruiting expense, and an increase of $0.1 million for facility and other overhead expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.1 million in noncash share-based compensation expense and $0.7 million of personnel and other general and administrative costs related to our acquisition of Vayant. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in our use of contract labor, a decrease of $0.4 million in other overhead expenses, and a decrease of $0.2 million in bad debt expense.\nResearch and development expenses. Personnel cost increased $3.4 million, which included $1.0 million related to our acquisition of Vayant. Personnel cost increased primarily due to our continued investment in headcount to develop new and improve existing technologies, partially offset by an $1.5 million increase in capitalized internal-use software development costs. The remaining increase of $1.3 million was attributable to non-personnel cost and related overhead expenses associated with higher personnel cost.\nAcquisition-related expenses. Acquisition-related expenses were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisting primarily of advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees, and retention bonuses related to our acquisition and integration of Vayant.\nOther income (expense), net:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible debt interest and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,111\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConvertible debt interest and amortization.
