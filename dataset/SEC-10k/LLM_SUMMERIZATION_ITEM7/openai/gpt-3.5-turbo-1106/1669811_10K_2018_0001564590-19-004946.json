The Company's services offerings consist of all non-print offerings, including document composition, compliance related EDGAR filing services, transaction solutions, language solutions, and the Company's software-as-a-service ( SaaS\u201d) solutions, including Venue Virtual Data Room ( Venue\u201d), FundSuiteArc, ActiveDisclosure and data and analytics, among others. The Company's product offerings primarily consist of conventional and digital printed products and related shipping costs.\nSpin-off Transaction\nOn October 1, 2016, DFIN became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by RRD of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of DFIN common stock to RRD shareholders (the Separation\u201d). Holders of RRD common stock received one share of DFIN common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. As part of the Separation, RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of DFIN common stock, or a 19.25% interest in DFIN, of which 6.1 million shares and 0.1 million shares were subsequently sold in June 2017 and August 2017, respectively.\nDFIN's common stock began regular-way trading under the ticker symbol DFIN\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016. On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC, its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business. On March 28, 2017, RRD completed the sale of 6.2 million shares of LSC common stock (RRD's remaining ownership stake in LSC) in an underwritten public offering. As a result, beginning in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, LSC no longer qualified as a related party of the Company. Beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2017, RRD no longer qualified as a related party, therefore amounts disclosed related to RRD are presented through June 30, 2017 only.\nExecutive Overview\n2018 Overview\nNet sales decreased by $41.9 million, or 4.2%, in 2018 compared to 2017, including a $2.7 million, or 0.3%, increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Net sales decreased primarily due to the sale of the Language Solutions business, lower volumes in capital markets compliance and mutual fund print and print related services, partially offset by higher SaaS volumes in FundSuiteArc, virtual data room services and ActiveDisclosure, along with higher capital markets transactions.\nOn July 22, 2018, the Company sold its Language Solutions business, which helped companies adapt their business content into different languages for specific countries, markets and regions, for net proceeds of $77.5 million in cash, all of which was received as of December 31, 2018, resulting in a net gain of $53.8 million, which was recognized in other operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company used approximately $60.0 million of net proceeds from the sale to pay down debt under the Term Loan Credit Facility (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources) in July 2018 in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company acquired eBrevia, a leading provider of artificial intelligence-based data extraction and contract analytics software solutions. The Company previously held a 12.8% investment in eBrevia prior to the acquisition. The purchase price for the remaining equity of eBrevia, which includes the Company's estimate of contingent consideration, was $23.2 million, net of cash acquired of $0.2 million. $4.1 million of the purchase price, excluding contingent consideration and amounts held in escrow, was payable as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be paid during 2019. The eBrevia technology provides leading enterprise contract review and analysis solutions, leveraging machine learning to produce faster and more accurate results. eBrevia's software, which extracts and summarizes key legal provisions and other information, can be used in due diligence, contract management, lease abstraction and document drafting.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2019, the Company expects net sales to decrease slightly due to the sale of Language Solutions during 2018, offset by growth in the Company's SaaS offerings and the acquisition of eBrevia during 2018. The Company's outlook assumes a challenging capital markets environment in the first quarter of the year, returning to more normalized levels for the remainder of the year, and does not expect foreign exchange rates to have a significant impact on results.\nIn 2019, the Company will adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842)\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The Company is in the process of reviewing its existing lease portfolio, which is primarily comprised of real estate leases, to evaluate the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 23, New Accounting Pronouncements, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail.\nThe Company initiated several restructuring actions in 2017 and 2018 to further reduce the Company's overall cost structure. These restructuring actions included the reorganization of certain functions. These actions, as well as planned actions for 2019, are expected to have a positive impact on operating earnings in 2019 and in future years.\nCash flows from operations in 2019 are expected to benefit from cost control actions and lower interest expense. The Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $40.0 million to $45.0 million in 2019, as compared to $37.1 million in 2018.\nWhile expected to decline as compared to 2018, the Company expects to continue to incur spin-off related transition expenses in 2019, including third-party consulting fees and other expenses.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the extensive use of management's estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for items and matters including, but not limited to, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, pension, asset valuations and useful lives, income taxes and other provisions and contingencies.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company manages highly-customized data and materials, such as Exchange Act, Securities Act and Investment Company Act filings with the SEC on behalf of our customers, manages virtual data rooms and performs XBRL and related services. Clients are provided with EDGAR filing services, XBRL compliance services and translation, editing, interpreting, proof-reading and multilingual typesetting services, among others. The Company's SaaS solutions include the Venue Virtual Data Room, the FundSuiteArc software platform, ActiveDisclosure and data and analytics, among others.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services or products. The Company's arrangements with customers often include promises to transfer multiple services or products to a customer. Determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment. Certain customer arrangements have multiple performance obligations as certain promises are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. Other customer arrangements have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts, and therefore are not distinct.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations. As the Company provides customer specific solutions, observable standalone selling price is rarely available. As such, standalone selling price is more frequently determined using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service or product, taking into consideration of historical selling price by customer for distinct service or product. These estimates may vary from the final amounts invoiced to the customer and are adjusted upon completion of all performance obligations.\nBecause substantially all of the Company's products are customized, product returns are not significant; however, the Company accrues for the estimated amount of customer credits at the time of sale. Refer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion.\nCertain revenues earned by the Company require significant judgment to determine if revenue should be recorded gross, as a principal, or net of related costs, as an agent. Billings for shipping and handling costs as well as certain postage costs and out-of-pocket expenses are recorded gross.\nRefer to Note 3, Revenue, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail regarding the impact of the 2018 adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d).\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company's methodology for allocating the purchase price of acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of several factors, including valuations performed by third-party appraisers when appropriate. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is either assigned to a specific reporting unit or allocated between reporting units based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit. Based on its current organization structure, the Company has identified three reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill may be allocated.\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment tests annually as of October 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit. As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit's operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year's annual impairment test. In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events. Based on these interim assessments, management concluded that as of the interim periods, no events or changes in circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value for any reporting unit had declined below its carrying amount.\nAs of October 31, 2018, the Capital Markets, Investment Markets and International reporting units had goodwill. Each of the reporting units were reviewed for impairment using a quantitative assessment.\nQuantitative Assessment for Impairment\nFor each of the reporting units, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is generally recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The results of the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment as of October 31, 2018, indicated that the estimated fair values for each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amount. Therefore, no impairment losses were recognized.\nThe analysis performed included estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, discount rates and the allocation of shared or corporate items. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The Company weighted both the income and market approach equally to estimate the concluded fair value of each reporting unit.\nThe determination of fair value in the quantitative assessment requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges and capital expenditures.\nAs a result of the 2018 annual goodwill impairment test, the Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses as the estimated fair values of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\nGoodwill Impairment Assumptions\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company's equity and debt securities may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying amount.\nOne measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit passed\u201d (fair value exceeds carrying amount) or failed\u201d (the carrying amount exceeds fair value) the quantitative assessment. Each of the reporting units that were quantitatively assessed had fair values that exceeded the carrying amounts by between 29.3% and 125.4% of their respective estimated fair values. Relatively small changes in the Company's key assumptions would not have resulted in any reporting units being impaired.\nGenerally, changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. That is, a 1.0% decrease in estimated annual future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 1.0%. The estimated long-term net sales growth rate can have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows, and therefore, the fair value of each reporting unit. A 1.0% decrease in the long-term net sales growth rate would not have resulted in an impairment loss for any of the reporting units. Of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values, most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate. The estimated discount rate for the reporting units with operations located in the U.S. was 10.0% as of October 31, 2018. The estimated discount rate for the reporting unit with operations in foreign locations was 11.5% as of October 31, 2018. A 1.0% increase in estimated discount rates would not have resulted in an impairment loss for any of the reporting units. The Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows and discount rates are reasonable, but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making such estimates. Additionally, further price deterioration or lower volume could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and certain identifiable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company performs impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. Factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business, a significant decrease in the market value of the assets or significant negative industry or economic trends. When the Company determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. There was no impairment charge related to intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans\nOur Participation in RRD's Pension and Postretirement Benefits Plans\nRRD provided pension and other postretirement healthcare benefits to certain current and former employees of DFIN. DFIN's consolidated and combined statements of operations include expense allocations for these benefits. These allocations were funded through intercompany transactions with RRD which are reflected within net parent company investment in DFIN.\nDFIN's Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nOn October 1, 2016, DFIN recorded net pension plan liabilities of $68.3 million (consisting of a total benefit plan liability of $317.0 million, net of plan assets having fair market value of $248.7 million), as a result of the transfer of certain pension plan liabilities and assets from RRD to the Company upon the legal split of those plans. The pension plan asset allocation from RRD was finalized on June 30, 2017, which resulted in a $0.7 million decrease to the fair value of plan assets transferred to the Company from RRD. The Company also recorded a net other postretirement benefit liability of $1.5 million, as a result of the transfer of an other postretirement benefit plan from RRD to the Company.\nThe Company's primary defined benefit plan is frozen. No new employees are permitted to enter the Company's frozen plan and participants will earn no additional benefits. Benefits are generally based upon years of service and compensation. These defined benefit retirement income plans are funded in conformity with the applicable government regulations. The Company funds at least the minimum amount required for all funded plans using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under government regulations.\nThe annual income and expense amounts relating to the pension plan are based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including, mortality expectations, discount rates and expected long-term rates of return. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of December 31 (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modifies the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the consolidated balance sheets, but are amortized into operating earnings over future periods, with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors. The weighted-average discount rate for pension benefits at December 31, 2018 was 4.4%.\nA one-percentage point change in the discount rates at December 31, 2018 would have the following effects on the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0%\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0%\nDecrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accumulated benefit obligation\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's defined benefit plan has a risk management approach for its pension plan assets. The overall investment objective of this approach is to further reduce the risk of significant decreases in the plan's funded status by allocating a larger portion of the plan's assets to investments expected to hedge the impact of interest rate risks on the plan's obligation.\nThe expected long-term rate of return for the plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions and risk. In addition, the Company considered the impact of the current interest rate environment on the expected long-term rate of return for certain asset classes, particularly fixed income. The target asset allocation percentage for the pension plan was approximately 50.0% for return seeking investments and approximately 50.0% for fixed income investments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used to calculate net pension plan expense in 2018 was 6.8% for the Company's pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption that will be used to calculate net pension plan expense in 2019 is 6.3%.\nA 0.25% change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2018 would have the following effects on 2018 and 2019 pension plan (income)/expense:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0.25% increase\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0.25% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements, income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been calculated on a separate income tax return basis although, with respect to certain entities, the Company's operations prior to the Separation have historically been included in the tax returns filed by the respective RRD entities of which the Company's business was a part. As a standalone entity post-Separation, the Company files tax returns on its own behalf and its deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differ from those in historical periods.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company's tax returns are subject to audit by various U.S. and foreign tax authorities. The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. This recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be materially different from that which is reflected in the Company's historical financial statements.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax assets related to future deductible items, including domestic and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards. The Company evaluates these deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction. The utilization of these tax assets is limited by the amount of taxable income expected to be generated within the allowable carryforward period and other factors. Accordingly, management has provided a valuation allowance to reduce certain of these deferred tax assets when management has concluded that, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. If actual results differ from these estimates, or the estimates are adjusted in future periods, adjustments to the valuation allowance might need to be recorded. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, valuation allowances of $2.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, were recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period of one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete their accounting. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply its accounting on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the tax effects and recorded provisional amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, the Company revalued its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The Company recorded a reduction in the value of its net U.S. deferred tax asset of approximately $8.2 million, which was recorded as additional deferred income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Due to the transition to a territorial tax system under the Tax Act, the Company will be deemed to repatriate its foreign subsidiaries' untaxed accumulated earnings and pay a mandatory U.S. federal tax ( the transition tax\u201d) of 15.5% on the portion of the earnings that are in cash and cash equivalents and 8.0% on the portion of earnings that are in non-cash and non-cash equivalent assets. The Company estimated this tax liability (federal and state) to be approximately $14.2 million which was recorded as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a $0.1 million increase to the deemed repatriation tax liability and a $2.2 million benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adjustments were the result of the Company's completion of the analysis of the impact of the Tax Act including changes in interpretations and assumptions that the Company previously made for the prior year provisional estimates as well as the impact from additional regulatory guidance issued. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's analysis for the income tax effects of the Tax Act was completed.\nRefer to Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail on the accounting for income taxes and SAB 118.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, employment, commercial and other matters, as well as preference claims related to amounts received from customers and others prior to their seeking bankruptcy protection. Periodically, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the related liability is estimable, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the related potential liability and may revise its estimates.\nWith respect to claims made under the Company's third-party insurance for workers' compensation, automobile and general liability, the Company is responsible for the payment of claims below and above insured limits, and consulting actuaries are utilized to assist the Company in estimating the obligation associated with any such incurred losses, which are recorded in accrued and other non-current liabilities. Historical loss development factors for both the Company and the industry are utilized to project the future development of such incurred losses, and these amounts are adjusted based upon actual claims experience and settlements. If actual experience of claims development is significantly different from these estimates, an adjustment in future periods may be required. Expected recoveries of such losses are recorded in other current and other non-current assets.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for products and services. Specific customer provisions are made when a review of significant outstanding amounts, utilizing information about customer creditworthiness and current economic trends, indicates that collection is doubtful. In addition, provisions are made at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable and the Company's past collection experience. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $7.9 million at December 31, 2018 and $7.3 million at December 31, 2017. The Company also maintains a reserve for potential credit memos and disputed items. The credit memo and disputed items reserve is based on historical credit memos relative to billings as well as specific customer reserves and was $4.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $7.4 million at December 31, 2017. The Company's estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change, and additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the future, if any major customer's creditworthiness deteriorates or actual defaults are higher than the Company's historical experience.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than non-cancelable operating lease commitments, the Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or special purpose entities.\nFinancial Review\nIn the financial review that follows, the Company discusses its consolidated and combined results of operations, cash flows and certain other information. In periods prior to the Separation, the combined financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from RRD's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. There are limitations inherent in the preparation of all carve out financial statements due to the fact that the Company's business was previously part of a larger organization. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table shows the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 618.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 632.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 345.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 372.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 963.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,004.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 328.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 328.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services cost of sales with RRD affiliates (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 258.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 240.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products cost of sales with RRD affiliates (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 587.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 621.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 258.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 236.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 121.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Beginning in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, LSC no longer qualified as a related party, therefore the 2017 amounts disclosed related to LSC are presented through March 31, 2017 only.

Net sales of services decreased primarily due to the impact from the sale of the Language Solutions business, lower volumes in capital markets compliance and mutual fund print-related services and a $0.1 million decrease due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, partially offset by growth in SaaS solutions, primarily in FundSuiteArc, virtual data room services and ActiveDisclosure and higher volumes in capital markets transactions.\nNet sales of products for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $27.8 million, or 7.5%, to $345.0 million versus the year ended December 31, 2017, including a $0.5 million, or 0.1%, increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Net sales of products decreased due to lower mutual fund print, capital markets compliance and commercial print volumes, partially offset by higher capital markets transactions volumes.\nServices cost of sales decreased $19.4 million, or 5.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the year ended December 31, 2017. Services cost of sales decreased primarily due to the impact from the sale of the Language Solutions business, a $0.6 million, or 0.2%, decrease due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and cost control initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, services cost of sales decreased 1.9% due to favorable mix, a decrease in incentive compensation expense and cost control initiatives.\nProducts cost of sales decreased $14.7 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the year ended December 31, 2017. Products cost of sales decreased due to lower mutual fund print, capital markets compliance and commercial print volumes and cost control initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, products cost of sales increased 1.6% primarily due to unfavorable mix, offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $22.0 million, or 9.3%, to $258.2 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in spin-off related transaction expenses, which include system implementation expenses as a result of transitioning from transition service agreements and disposition-related expenses related to the disposition of Language Solutions. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased from 23.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 26.8% for year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to increased spin-off related transaction expenses and disposition-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $4.4 million compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these charges included $3.4 million of employee termination costs for 89 employees, substantially all of whom were terminated as of December 31, 2018. These charges primarily related to the reorganization of certain operations and certain administrative functions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company also incurred $0.8 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs and $0.2 million for other charges associated with the Company's decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain-multi-employer pension plans serving facilities that continued to operate. For the year ended December 31, 2017, these charges included $6.4 million of employee termination costs for 192 employees, all of whom were terminated as of December 31, 2018. These charges were primarily the result of the reorganization of certain administrative functions. The Company also incurred lease termination and other restructuring charges of $0.3 million, $0.2 million of net impairment charges primarily related to leasehold improvements associated with facility closures and $0.2 million associated with the Company's decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain multi-employer pension plans that continued to operate.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $1.3 million, or 2.9%, to $45.8 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to numerous changes in U.S. corporate tax law pursuant to the enactment of the Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the taxation of certain foreign earnings, referred to in the Tax Act as global intangible low-taxed income, and non-deductible expenses. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 also reflects the impact of the sale of the Language Solutions business.

Net sales of services increased due to higher volumes in virtual data room services, mutual fund print-related services, translations services and content management, partially offset by lower capital markets compliance volumes.\nNet sales of products for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $12.1 million, or 3.1%, to $372.8 million versus the year ended December 31, 2016, including a $0.8 million, or 0.2%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Net sales of products decreased due to lower capital markets transactions volumes, healthcare volumes and price pressures in investment markets, partially offset by higher capital markets compliance and mutual fund print volumes.\nServices cost of sales increased $13.3 million, or 4.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, versus the year ended December 31, 2016. Services cost of sales increased due to higher mutual fund print-related services and content management volumes, an increase in the allocation of information technology expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to cost of sales and an increase in incentive compensation expense, partially offset by cost control initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, services cost of sales decreased 0.8% due to favorable mix and cost control initiatives.\nProducts cost of sales decreased $10.9 million, or 3.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, versus the year ended December 31, 2016. Products cost of sales decreased due to lower capital markets transaction and healthcare volumes and cost control initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, products cost of sales decreased 0.5% primarily due to a favorable mix of product sales and cost control initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $25.4 million, or 12.0%, to $236.2 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company, including selling expenses, employee compensation costs and spin-off related transaction expenses, partially offset by an increase in the allocation of information technology expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to cost of sales. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased from 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 23.5% for year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased costs of operating as an independent public company, including spin-off related transaction expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $7.1 million compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, these charges included $6.4 million of employee termination costs for 192 employees, all of whom were terminated as of December 31, 2018. These charges primarily related to the reorganization of certain operations and certain administrative functions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also incurred $0.3 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs, $0.2 million of net impairment charges primarily related to leasehold improvements associated with facility closures and $0.2 million for other charges associated with the Company's decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain-multi-employer pension plans serving facilities that continued to operate. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these charges included $3.7 million of employee termination costs for 84 employees, all of whom were terminated as of December 31, 2016. These charges were primarily the result of the reorganization of certain administrative functions. The Company also incurred lease termination and other restructuring charges of $1.5 million and other charges of $0.2 million associated with the Company's decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain multi-employer pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $1.2 million, or 2.8%, to $44.5 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Depreciation and amortization included $15.0 million and $14.4 million of amortization of other intangible assets related to customer relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $9.3 million, or 8.9%, to $95.7 million versus the year ended December 31, 2016, due to lower volumes in capital markets transactions and healthcare print and an increase in expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company, including selling expenses, employee compensation costs and spin-off related transaction expenses, partially offset by cost control initiatives and higher volumes in capital markets compliance, virtual data room services, mutual funds print-related services and content management.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense-net\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 266.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest expense increased by $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 versus the year ended December 31, 2016, due to the issuance of debt in connection with the Separation.

The 2017 effective income tax rate is higher as compared to the 2016 effective income tax rate primarily due to impacts of the changes to U.S. tax legislation as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, including the transition tax imposed on the Company's accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of the Company's U.S net deferred tax asset. The 2017 effective income tax rate was also impacted by non-deductible expenses incurred by the Company in 2017 which were previously incurred by RRD on behalf of the Company during pre-Separation periods, as well as a one-time favorable change in a valuation allowance in 2016 not present in 2017.\nInformation by Segment\nThe following tables summarize net sales, income (loss) from operations and certain items impacting comparability within each of the operating segments and Corporate.\nU.S.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 847.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 845.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Spin-off related transaction expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales for the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reporting unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital Markets\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 455.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 466.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Markets*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 367.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 354.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Language Solutions*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total U.S.\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 847.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 845.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Certain prior year amounts were restated to conform to the Company's current reporting unit structure.\nNet sales for the U.S. segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $847.9 million, an increase of $2.7 million, or 0.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the Company's core business operating results over different periods of time. The Company believes that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about the Company's business without regard to potential distortions. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historic cost and age of assets, restructuring, impairment and other charges, acquisition-related expenses and gain or loss on certain equity investments and asset sales, the Company believes that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with GAAP and has important limitations as an analytical tool. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. In addition, these measures are defined differently by different companies in our industry and, accordingly, such measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nIn addition to the factors listed above, the following items are excluded from Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Spin-off related transaction expenses.

Management does not believe that these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results.

The year ended December 31, 2018 included $3.4 million for employee termination costs, $0.8 million of net lease termination and other restructuring costs and $0.2 million for other charges associated with the Company's decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain multi-employer pension plans serving facilities that continued to operate.\n2017 Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net. The year ended December 31, 2017 included $6.4 million for employee termination costs, $0.3 million of net lease termination and other restructuring costs, $0.2 million of net impairment charges related to leasehold improvements associated with facility closures and $0.2 million for other charges associated with the Company's decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain multi-employer pension plans serving facilities that continued to operate.\n2016 Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net. The year ended December 31, 2016 included $3.7 million for employee termination costs, $1.5 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs and $0.2 million for other charges associated with the Company's decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain multi-employer pension plans serving facilities that continued to operate.\nAcquisition-related expenses. Included pre-tax charges of $0.8 million and $0.2 million primarily related to legal expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, associated with completed or contemplated acquisitions.\nInvestor-related expenses. Included pre-tax charges of $0.5 million related to non-routine investor matters. These expenses include third-party advisory and consulting fees and legal fees for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPrior to the Separation, RRD provided financing, cash management and other treasury services to DFIN. The Company's cash balances were swept by RRD and the Company received funding from RRD for operating and investing needs. Cash transferred to and from RRD was recorded as intercompany payables and receivables which are reflected in the net parent company investment in the consolidated and combined financial statements. Subsequent to the Separation, the Company no longer participates in cash management and funding arrangements with RRD.\nThe Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing operations and to invest in future growth to create value for its shareholders. Cash on hand, operating cash flows and the Company's $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility\u201d) are the primary sources of liquidity and are expected to be used for, among other things, payment of interest and principal on the Company's debt obligations, capital expenditures necessary to support productivity improvement and growth, acquisitions and completion of restructuring programs.\nThe following describes the Company's cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nCash Flows Provided By Operating Activities\nOperating cash inflows are largely attributable to sales of the Company's services and products. Operating cash outflows are largely attributable to recurring expenditures for labor, rent, raw materials and other operating activities. For periods prior to the Separation, allocations of operating expenses from RRD are also reflected as operating cash inflows or outflows, including those for pension costs and current income taxes payable.\n2018 compared to 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected timing of customer and supplier payments and higher payments for incentive compensation partially offset by lower payments related to taxes and interest.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher payments related to interest and taxes and the timing of payments for suppliers and employee-related liabilities, offset by the timing of customer payments.\nCash Flows Used For Investing Activities\n2018 compared to 2017\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $31.0 million used in investing for the year ended December 31, 2017. Capital expenditures were $37.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $9.3 million as compared to the same period of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by investing activities included $77.5 million net proceeds from the sale of the Language Solutions business, partially offset by $12.5 million of cash paid for the acquisition of eBrevia. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in investing activities included $3.4 million for the purchase of an investment in AuditBoard.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet cash used in investing activities was $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures were $27.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.6 million as compared to the same period of 2016.\nCash Flows Used For Financing Activities\n2018 compared to 2017\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $99.0 million compared to $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected $97.5 million of payments on long-term debt. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflected $133.0 million in payments on long-term debt, offset by a $68.0 million Separation-related payment from RRD and $18.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\n2017 compared to 2016\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $45.7 million compared to $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities reflected $133.0 million in payments on long-term debt in 2017, partially offset by a $68.0 million Separation-related payment from RRD and $18.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflected $340.1 million in net transfers to RRD and its affiliates in connection with the Separation and $50.0 million in payments on long-term debt, offset by $348.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.\nContractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following table

Company maintains cash pooling structures that enable participating international locations to draw on the pools' cash resources to meet local liquidity needs. Foreign cash balances may be loaned from certain cash pools to U.S. operating entities on a temporary basis in order to reduce the Company's short-term borrowing costs or for other purposes.\nCash and cash equivalents were $47.3 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $4.7 million as compared to December 31, 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents of $47.3 million at December 31, 2018 included $29.9 million in the U.S. and $17.4 million at international locations. As a result of the transition tax incurred pursuant to the Tax Act, the Company now has the ability to repatriate any previously taxed foreign cash associated with the foreign earnings subject to the U.S. parent with minimal tax consequences. The Company intends to repatriate earnings up to its net earnings previously subject to U.S. tax. Thus, the Company updated its assertion in 2018 related to indefinite reinvestment on all foreign earnings and other outside basis differences to indicate that the Company remains indefinitely reinvested in operations outside of the U.S. with the exception of the previously taxed foreign cash already subject to U.S. tax. The Company continues to analyze its global working capital and cash requirements to determine the amount of excess cash at its foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated to the U.S. with minimal additional taxes. The Company has not yet completed its global capital structure analysis. As such, the Company has not recorded deferred taxes attributable to the book-over-tax outside basis differences in its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018. The Company will record the tax effects related to repatriating any previously taxed foreign cash in the period when the Company begins repatriating this previously taxed foreign cash.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company received a cash payment of $68.0 million from RRD on April 3, 2017. The proceeds were used to reduce outstanding debt under the Term Loan Credit Facility.\nOn June 21, 2017, RRD completed the sale of approximately 6.1 million shares of the Company's common stock in an underwritten public offering. RRD retained approximately 0.1 million shares of the Company's common stock upon consummation of the offering which were subsequently sold by RRD on August 4, 2017. In conjunction with the underwritten public offering, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase approximately 0.9 million Option Shares. The Company received approximately $18.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Option Shares, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions. The proceeds were used to reduce outstanding debt under the Revolving Facility.\nOn October 2, 2017, the Company repriced the Term Loan Credit Facility. As a result, the interest rate was reduced by 100 basis points to LIBOR plus 3.0% and the LIBOR floor was reduced by 25 basis points to 0.75%. Additionally, under the amended Credit Agreement, principal payments are due on a quarterly basis. Other terms, including the outstanding principal, maturity date, and debt covenants such as the minimum interest coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio are consistent with the original Credit Agreement.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement which extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility to December 18, 2023, reduced the interest rate margin percentages and facility fees applicable to the Revolving Facility, increased the allowable annual dividends from $15.0 million to $20.0 million in the aggregate and modified the financial maintenance and negative covenants in the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company's debt maturity schedule as of December 31, 2018 is shown in the table below:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Debt Maturity Schedule\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes (a)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Facility (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings under the Revolving Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 372.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs of $4.8 million which do not represent contractual commitments with a fixed amount or maturity date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.8 million and a discount of $1.2 million which do not represent contractual commitments with a fixed amount or maturity date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants, including, but not limited to, a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio and the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in and calculated pursuant to the Credit Agreement, that, in part, restrict the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments and dispose of certain assets. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of up to $20.0 million in aggregate, though additional dividends may be allowed subject to certain conditions. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications.\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, including limitations on: (1) liens; (2) indebtedness; (3) mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; (4) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (5) loans and other investments; (6) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; (7) restrictions affecting subsidiaries; (8) transactions with affiliates; and (9) designations of unrestricted subsidiaries. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Facility. Based on the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 and existing debt, the Company would have had the ability to utilize $254.7 million of the $300.0 million Revolving Facility and not have been in violation of the terms of the agreement. The current availability under the Revolving Facility and net available liquidity as of December 31, 2018 is shown in the table below:\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Availability reduction from covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 254.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Usage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings under the Revolving Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact on availability related to outstanding letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current availability at December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 254.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Available Liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 302.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2018, and expects to remain in compliance based on management's estimates of operating and financial results for 2019 and the foreseeable future. However, declines in market and economic conditions or demand for certain of the Company's products and services could impact the Company's ability to remain in compliance with its debt covenants in future periods. As of December 31, 2018, the Company met all the conditions required to borrow under the Credit Agreement and management expects the Company to continue to meet the applicable borrowing conditions.\nThe failure of a financial institution supporting the Revolving Facility would reduce the size of the Company's committed facility unless a replacement institution was added. As of December 31, 2018, the Revolving Facility is supported by sixteen U.S. and international financial institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had $3.1 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, of which none reduced to the availability under the Revolving Facility.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company paid $12.5 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of eBrevia. $4.1 million of the purchase price, excluding contingent consideration, was payable as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be paid during 2019. $1.9 million of the purchase price related to amounts held in escrow was payable as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be paid during 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company sold its Language Solutions business for net proceeds of $77.5 million in cash, all of which was received as of December 31, 2018. The Company used approximately $60.0 million of net proceeds from the sale to pay down debt under the Term Loan Credit Facility in July 2018 in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.\nDebt Issuances\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement, which provided for the Term Loan Credit Facility and the Revolving Facility. The Term Loan Facility will mature on September 30, 2023. On December 18, 2018, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement which extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from September 30, 2021 to December 18, 2023.\nOn September 30, 2016, the Company issued $300.0 million of 8.250% Senior Notes (the Notes\u201d) due October 15, 2024. Interest on the Notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2017.\nThe Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture where certain wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company guarantee the Notes (the Guarantors\u201d). In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of September 30, 2016 (the Registration Rights Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an offer to exchange the Notes for registered notes. On March 10, 2017, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (as amended, the Exchange Offer Registration Statement\u201d) to offer to exchange the Notes for registered notes which have terms identical in all material respects to the Notes except that the registered notes are not subject to transfer restrictions or registration rights. The Exchange Offer Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 22, 2017. An exchange offer for the Notes was launched on March 22, 2017 and settled on April 25, 2017, resulting in the exchange of $299.9 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes for registered notes.\nRisk Management\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable debt. At December 31, 2018, the Company's exposure to rate fluctuations on variable-interest borrowings was $72.5 million.\nThe Company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates. Using this sensitivity analysis, such changes would not have a material effect on interest income or expense and cash flows. A hypothetical 10% change in yield would change the fair values of fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2018 by approximately $10.9 million, or 3.6%.\nThe Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in certain countries in which it operates. The exposure to foreign currency movements is limited in many countries because the operating revenues and expenses of its various subsidiaries and business units are substantially in the local currency of the country in which they operate. To the extent that borrowings, sales, purchases, revenues, expenses or other transactions are not in the local currency of the subsidiary, the Company is exposed to currency risk and may enter into foreign exchange spot and forward contracts to hedge the currency risk.

The Company's services offerings consist of all non-print offerings, including document composition, compliance related EDGAR filing services, transaction solutions, language solutions, and the Company's software-as-a-service ( SaaS\u201d) solutions, including Venue Virtual Data Room ( Venue\u201d), FundSuiteArc, ActiveDisclosure and data and analytics, among others. The Company's product offerings primarily consist of conventional and digital printed products and related shipping costs.\nSpin-off Transaction\nOn October 1, 2016, DFIN became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by RRD of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of DFIN common stock to RRD shareholders (the Separation\u201d). Holders of RRD common stock received one share of DFIN common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. As part of the Separation, RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of DFIN common stock, or a 19.25% interest in DFIN, of which 6.1 million shares and 0.1 million shares were subsequently sold in June 2017 and August 2017, respectively.\nDFIN's common stock began regular-way trading under the ticker symbol DFIN\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016. On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC, its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business. On March 28, 2017, RRD completed the sale of 6.2 million shares of LSC common stock (RRD's remaining ownership stake in LSC) in an underwritten public offering. As a result, beginning in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, LSC no longer qualified as a related party of the Company. Beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2017, RRD no longer qualified as a related party, therefore amounts disclosed related to RRD are presented through June 30, 2017 only.\nExecutive Overview\n2018 Overview\nNet sales decreased by $41.9 million, or 4.2%, in 2018 compared to 2017, including a $2.7 million, or 0.3%, increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Net sales decreased primarily due to the sale of the Language Solutions business, lower volumes in capital markets compliance and mutual fund print and print related services, partially offset by higher SaaS volumes in FundSuiteArc, virtual data room services and ActiveDisclosure, along with higher capital markets transactions.\nOn July 22, 2018, the Company sold its Language Solutions business, which helped companies adapt their business content into different languages for specific countries, markets and regions, for net proceeds of $77.5 million in cash, all of which was received as of December 31, 2018, resulting in a net gain of $53.8 million, which was recognized in other operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company used approximately $60.0 million of net proceeds from the sale to pay down debt under the Term Loan Credit Facility (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources) in July 2018 in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company acquired eBrevia, a leading provider of artificial intelligence-based data extraction and contract analytics software solutions. The Company previously held a 12.8% investment in eBrevia prior to the acquisition. The purchase price for the remaining equity of eBrevia, which includes the Company's estimate of contingent consideration, was $23.2 million, net of cash acquired of $0.2 million. $4.1 million of the purchase price, excluding contingent consideration and amounts held in escrow, was payable as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be paid during 2019. The eBrevia technology provides leading enterprise contract review and analysis solutions, leveraging machine learning to produce faster and more accurate results. eBrevia's software, which extracts and summarizes key legal provisions and other information, can be used in due diligence, contract management, lease abstraction and document drafting.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2019, the Company expects net sales to decrease slightly due to the sale of Language Solutions during 2018, offset by growth in the Company's SaaS offerings and the acquisition of eBrevia during 2018. The Company's outlook assumes a challenging capital markets environment in the first quarter of the year, returning to more normalized levels for the remainder of the year, and does not expect foreign exchange rates to have a significant impact on results.\nIn 2019, the Company will adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842)\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The Company is in the process of reviewing its existing lease portfolio, which is primarily comprised of real estate leases, to evaluate the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 23, New Accounting Pronouncements, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail.\nThe Company initiated several restructuring actions in 2017 and 2018 to further reduce the Company's overall cost structure. These restructuring actions included the reorganization of certain functions. These actions, as well as planned actions for 2019, are expected to have a positive impact on operating earnings in 2019 and in future years.\nCash flows from operations in 2019 are expected to benefit from cost control actions and lower interest expense. The Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $40.0 million to $45.0 million in 2019, as compared to $37.1 million in 2018.\nWhile expected to decline as compared to 2018, the Company expects to continue to incur spin-off related transition expenses in 2019, including third-party consulting fees and other expenses.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the extensive use of management's estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for items and matters including, but not limited to, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, pension, asset valuations and useful lives, income taxes and other provisions and contingencies.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company manages highly-customized data and materials, such as Exchange Act, Securities Act and Investment Company Act filings with the SEC on behalf of our customers, manages virtual data rooms and performs XBRL and related services. Clients are provided with EDGAR filing services, XBRL compliance services and translation, editing, interpreting, proof-reading and multilingual typesetting services, among others. The Company's SaaS solutions include the Venue Virtual Data Room, the FundSuiteArc software platform, ActiveDisclosure and data and analytics, among others.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services or products. The Company's arrangements with customers often include promises to transfer multiple services or products to a customer. Determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment. Certain customer arrangements have multiple performance obligations as certain promises are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. Other customer arrangements have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts, and therefore are not distinct.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations. As the Company provides customer specific solutions, observable standalone selling price is rarely available. As such, standalone selling price is more frequently determined using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service or product, taking into consideration of historical selling price by customer for distinct service or product. These estimates may vary from the final amounts invoiced to the customer and are adjusted upon completion of all performance obligations.\nBecause substantially all of the Company's products are customized, product returns are not significant; however, the Company accrues for the estimated amount of customer credits at the time of sale. Refer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion.\nCertain revenues earned by the Company require significant judgment to determine if revenue should be recorded gross, as a principal, or net of related costs, as an agent. Billings for shipping and handling costs as well as certain postage costs and out-of-pocket expenses are recorded gross.\nRefer to Note 3, Revenue, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail regarding the impact of the 2018 adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d).\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company's methodology for allocating the purchase price of acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of several factors, including valuations performed by third-party appraisers when appropriate. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is either assigned to a specific reporting unit or allocated between reporting units based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit. Based on its current organization structure, the Company has identified three reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill may be allocated.\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment tests annually as of October 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit. As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit's operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year's annual impairment test. In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events. Based on these interim assessments, management concluded that as of the interim periods, no events or changes in circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value for any reporting unit had declined below its carrying amount.\nAs of October 31, 2018, the Capital Markets, Investment Markets and International reporting units had goodwill. Each of the reporting units were reviewed for impairment using a quantitative assessment.\nQuantitative Assessment for Impairment\nFor each of the reporting units, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is generally recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The results of the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment as of October 31, 2018, indicated that the estimated fair values for each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amount. Therefore, no impairment losses were recognized.\nThe analysis performed included estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, discount rates and the allocation of shared or corporate items. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The Company weighted both the income and market approach equally to estimate the concluded fair value of each reporting unit.\nThe determination of fair value in the quantitative assessment requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges and capital expenditures.\nAs a result of the 2018 annual goodwill impairment test, the Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses as the estimated fair values of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\nGoodwill Impairment Assumptions\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company's equity and debt securities may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying amount.\nOne measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit passed\u201d (fair value exceeds carrying amount) or failed\u201d (the carrying amount exceeds fair value) the quantitative assessment. Each of the reporting units that were quantitatively assessed had fair values that exceeded the carrying amounts by between 29.3% and 125.4% of their respective estimated fair values. Relatively small changes in the Company's key assumptions would not have resulted in any reporting units being impaired.\nGenerally, changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. That is, a 1.0% decrease in estimated annual future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 1.0%. The estimated long-term net sales growth rate can have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows, and therefore, the fair value of each reporting unit. A 1.0% decrease in the long-term net sales growth rate would not have resulted in an impairment loss for any of the reporting units. Of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values, most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate. The estimated discount rate for the reporting units with operations located in the U.S. was 10.0% as of October 31, 2018. The estimated discount rate for the reporting unit with operations in foreign locations was 11.5% as of October 31, 2018. A 1.0% increase in estimated discount rates would not have resulted in an impairment loss for any of the reporting units. The Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows and discount rates are reasonable, but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making such estimates. Additionally, further price deterioration or lower volume could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and certain identifiable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company performs impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. Factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business, a significant decrease in the market value of the assets or significant negative industry or economic trends. When the Company determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. There was no impairment charge related to intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans\nOur Participation in RRD's Pension and Postretirement Benefits Plans\nRRD provided pension and other postretirement healthcare benefits to certain current and former employees of DFIN. DFIN's consolidated and combined statements of operations include expense allocations for these benefits. These allocations were funded through intercompany transactions with RRD which are reflected within net parent company investment in DFIN.\nDFIN's Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nOn October 1, 2016, DFIN recorded net pension plan liabilities of $68.3 million (consisting of a total benefit plan liability of $317.0 million, net of plan assets having fair market value of $248.7 million), as a result of the transfer of certain pension plan liabilities and assets from RRD to the Company upon the legal split of those plans. The pension plan asset allocation from RRD was finalized on June 30, 2017, which resulted in a $0.7 million decrease to the fair value of plan assets transferred to the Company from RRD. The Company also recorded a net other postretirement benefit liability of $1.5 million, as a result of the transfer of an other postretirement benefit plan from RRD to the Company.\nThe Company's primary defined benefit plan is frozen. No new employees are permitted to enter the Company's frozen plan and participants will earn no additional benefits. Benefits are generally based upon years of service and compensation. These defined benefit retirement income plans are funded in conformity with the applicable government regulations. The Company funds at least the minimum amount required for all funded plans using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under government regulations.\nThe annual income and expense amounts relating to the pension plan are based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including, mortality expectations, discount rates and expected long-term rates of return. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of December 31 (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modifies the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the consolidated balance sheets, but are amortized into operating earnings over future periods, with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors. The weighted-average discount rate for pension benefits at December 31, 2018 was 4.4%.\nA one-percentage point change in the discount rates at December 31, 2018 would have the following effects on the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation:\n\nThe Company's defined benefit plan has a risk management approach for its pension plan assets. The overall investment objective of this approach is to further reduce the risk of significant decreases in the plan's funded status by allocating a larger portion of the plan's assets to investments expected to hedge the impact of interest rate risks on the plan's obligation.\nThe expected long-term rate of return for the plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions and risk. In addition, the Company considered the impact of the current interest rate environment on the expected long-term rate of return for certain asset classes, particularly fixed income. The target asset allocation percentage for the pension plan was approximately 50.0% for return seeking investments and approximately 50.0% for fixed income investments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used to calculate net pension plan expense in 2018 was 6.8% for the Company's pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption that will be used to calculate net pension plan expense in 2019 is 6.3%.\nA 0.25% change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2018 would have the following effects on 2018 and 2019 pension plan (income)/expense:\n\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements, income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been calculated on a separate income tax return basis although, with respect to certain entities, the Company's operations prior to the Separation have historically been included in the tax returns filed by the respective RRD entities of which the Company's business was a part. As a standalone entity post-Separation, the Company files tax returns on its own behalf and its deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differ from those in historical periods.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company's tax returns are subject to audit by various U.S. and foreign tax authorities. The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. This recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be materially different from that which is reflected in the Company's historical financial statements.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax assets related to future deductible items, including domestic and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards. The Company evaluates these deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction. The utilization of these tax assets is limited by the amount of taxable income expected to be generated within the allowable carryforward period and other factors. Accordingly, management has provided a valuation allowance to reduce certain of these deferred tax assets when management has concluded that, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. If actual results differ from these estimates, or the estimates are adjusted in future periods, adjustments to the valuation allowance might need to be recorded. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, valuation allowances of $2.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, were recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period of one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete their accounting. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply its accounting on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the tax effects and recorded provisional amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, the Company revalued its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The Company recorded a reduction in the value of its net U.S. deferred tax asset of approximately $8.2 million, which was recorded as additional deferred income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Due to the transition to a territorial tax system under the Tax Act, the Company will be deemed to repatriate its foreign subsidiaries' untaxed accumulated earnings and pay a mandatory U.S. federal tax ( the transition tax\u201d) of 15.5% on the portion of the earnings that are in cash and cash equivalents and 8.0% on the portion of earnings that are in non-cash and non-cash equivalent assets. The Company estimated this tax liability (federal and state) to be approximately $14.2 million which was recorded as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a $0.1 million increase to the deemed repatriation tax liability and a $2.2 million benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adjustments were the result of the Company's completion of the analysis of the impact of the Tax Act including changes in interpretations and assumptions that the Company previously made for the prior year provisional estimates as well as the impact from additional regulatory guidance issued. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's analysis for the income tax effects of the Tax Act was completed.\nRefer to Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail on the accounting for income taxes and SAB 118.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, employment, commercial and other matters, as well as preference claims related to amounts received from customers and others prior to their seeking bankruptcy protection. Periodically, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the related liability is estimable, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the related potential liability and may revise its estimates.\nWith respect to claims made under the Company's third-party insurance for workers' compensation, automobile and general liability, the Company is responsible for the payment of claims below and above insured limits, and consulting actuaries are utilized to assist the Company in estimating the obligation associated with any such incurred losses, which are recorded in accrued and other non-current liabilities. Historical loss development factors for both the Company and the industry are utilized to project the future development of such incurred losses, and these amounts are adjusted based upon actual claims experience and settlements. If actual experience of claims development is significantly different from these estimates, an adjustment in future periods may be required. Expected recoveries of such losses are recorded in other current and other non-current assets.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for products and services. Specific customer provisions are made when a review of significant outstanding amounts, utilizing information about customer creditworthiness and current economic trends, indicates that collection is doubtful. In addition, provisions are made at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable and the Company's past collection experience. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $7.9 million at December 31, 2018 and $7.3 million at December 31, 2017. The Company also maintains a reserve for potential credit memos and disputed items. The credit memo and disputed items reserve is based on historical credit memos relative to billings as well as specific customer reserves and was $4.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $7.4 million at December 31, 2017. The Company's estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change, and additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the future, if any major customer's creditworthiness deteriorates or actual defaults are higher than the Company's historical experience.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than non-cancelable operating lease commitments, the Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or special purpose entities.\nFinancial Review\nIn the financial review that follows, the Company discusses its consolidated and combined results of operations, cash flows and certain other information. In periods prior to the Separation, the combined financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from RRD's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. There are limitations inherent in the preparation of all carve out financial statements due to the fact that the Company's business was previously part of a larger organization. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table shows the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 618.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 632.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 345.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion of DFIN's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated and combined financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 15 of Part IV, Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness\nFor a description of the Company's business, segments and product and service offerings, see Item 1, Business, of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company separately reports its net sales and related cost of sales for its products and services offerings. The Company's services offerings consist of all non-print offerings, including document composition, compliance related EDGAR filing services, transaction solutions, language solutions, and the Company's software-as-a-service ( SaaS\u201d) solutions, including Venue Virtual Data Room ( Venue\u201d), FundSuiteArc, ActiveDisclosure and data and analytics, among others. The Company's product offerings primarily consist of conventional and digital printed products and related shipping costs.\nSpin-off Transaction\nOn October 1, 2016, DFIN became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by RRD of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of DFIN common stock to RRD shareholders (the Separation\u201d). Holders of RRD common stock received one share of DFIN common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. As part of the Separation, RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of DFIN common stock, or a 19.25% interest in DFIN, of which 6.1 million shares and 0.1 million shares were subsequently sold in June 2017 and August 2017, respectively.\nDFIN's common stock began regular-way trading under the ticker symbol DFIN\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016. On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC, its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business. On March 28, 2017, RRD completed the sale of 6.2 million shares of LSC common stock (RRD's remaining ownership stake in LSC) in an underwritten public offering. As a result, beginning in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, LSC no longer qualified as a related party of the Company. Beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2017, RRD no longer qualified as a related party, therefore amounts disclosed related to RRD are presented through June 30, 2017 only.\nExecutive Overview\n2018 Overview\nNet sales decreased by $41.9 million, or 4.2%, in 2018 compared to 2017, including a $2.7 million, or 0.3%, increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Net sales decreased primarily due to the sale of the Language Solutions business, lower volumes in capital markets compliance and mutual fund print and print related services, partially offset by higher SaaS volumes in FundSuiteArc, virtual data room services and ActiveDisclosure, along with higher capital markets transactions.\nOn July 22, 2018, the Company sold its Language Solutions business, which helped companies adapt their business content into different languages for specific countries, markets and regions, for net proceeds of $77.5 million in cash, all of which was received as of December 31, 2018, resulting in a net gain of $53.8 million, which was recognized in other operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company used approximately $60.0 million of net proceeds from the sale to pay down debt under the Term Loan Credit Facility (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources) in July 2018 in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company acquired eBrevia, a leading provider of artificial intelligence-based data extraction and contract analytics software solutions. The Company previously held a 12.8% investment in eBrevia prior to the acquisition. The purchase price for the remaining equity of eBrevia, which includes the Company's estimate of contingent consideration, was $23.2 million, net of cash acquired of $0.2 million. $4.1 million of the purchase price, excluding contingent consideration and amounts held in escrow, was payable as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be paid during 2019. The eBrevia technology provides leading enterprise contract review and analysis solutions, leveraging machine learning to produce faster and more accurate results. eBrevia's software, which extracts and summarizes key legal provisions and other information, can be used in due diligence, contract management, lease abstraction and document drafting.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2019, the Company expects net sales to decrease slightly due to the sale of Language Solutions during 2018, offset by growth in the Company's SaaS offerings and the acquisition of eBrevia during 2018. The Company's outlook assumes a challenging capital markets environment in the first quarter of the year, returning to more normalized levels for the remainder of the year, and does not expect foreign exchange rates to have a significant impact on results.\nIn 2019, the Company will adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842)\u201d ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). The Company is in the process of reviewing its existing lease portfolio, which is primarily comprised of real estate leases, to evaluate the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 23, New Accounting Pronouncements, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail.\nThe Company initiated several restructuring actions in 2017 and 2018 to further reduce the Company's overall cost structure. These restructuring actions included the reorganization of certain functions. These actions, as well as planned actions for 2019, are expected to have a positive impact on operating earnings in 2019 and in future years.\nCash flows from operations in 2019 are expected to benefit from cost control actions and lower interest expense. The Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $40.0 million to $45.0 million in 2019, as compared to $37.1 million in 2018.\nWhile expected to decline as compared to 2018, the Company expects to continue to incur spin-off related transition expenses in 2019, including third-party consulting fees and other expenses.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the extensive use of management's estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for items and matters including, but not limited to, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, pension, asset valuations and useful lives, income taxes and other provisions and contingencies.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company manages highly-customized data and materials, such as Exchange Act, Securities Act and Investment Company Act filings with the SEC on behalf of our customers, manages virtual data rooms and performs XBRL and related services. Clients are provided with EDGAR filing services, XBRL compliance services and translation, editing, interpreting, proof-reading and multilingual typesetting services, among others. The Company's SaaS solutions include the Venue Virtual Data Room, the FundSuiteArc software platform, ActiveDisclosure and data and analytics, among others.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services or products. The Company's arrangements with customers often include promises to transfer multiple services or products to a customer. Determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment. Certain customer arrangements have multiple performance obligations as certain promises are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. Other customer arrangements have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts, and therefore are not distinct.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations. As the Company provides customer specific solutions, observable standalone selling price is rarely available. As such, standalone selling price is more frequently determined using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service or product, taking into consideration of historical selling price by customer for distinct service or product. These estimates may vary from the final amounts invoiced to the customer and are adjusted upon completion of all performance obligations.\nBecause substantially all of the Company's products are customized, product returns are not significant; however, the Company accrues for the estimated amount of customer credits at the time of sale. Refer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion.\nCertain revenues earned by the Company require significant judgment to determine if revenue should be recorded gross, as a principal, or net of related costs, as an agent. Billings for shipping and handling costs as well as certain postage costs and out-of-pocket expenses are recorded gross.\nRefer to Note 3, Revenue, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail regarding the impact of the 2018 adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d).\nGoodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company's methodology for allocating the purchase price of acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of several factors, including valuations performed by third-party appraisers when appropriate. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is either assigned to a specific reporting unit or allocated between reporting units based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit. Based on its current organization structure, the Company has identified three reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill may be allocated.\nThe Company performs its goodwill impairment tests annually as of October 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit. As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit's operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year's annual impairment test. In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events. Based on these interim assessments, management concluded that as of the interim periods, no events or changes in circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value for any reporting unit had declined below its carrying amount.\nAs of October 31, 2018, the Capital Markets, Investment Markets and International reporting units had goodwill. Each of the reporting units were reviewed for impairment using a quantitative assessment.\nQuantitative Assessment for Impairment\nFor each of the reporting units, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is generally recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The results of the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment as of October 31, 2018, indicated that the estimated fair values for each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amount. Therefore, no impairment losses were recognized.\nThe analysis performed included estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, discount rates and the allocation of shared or corporate items. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The Company weighted both the income and market approach equally to estimate the concluded fair value of each reporting unit.\nThe determination of fair value in the quantitative assessment requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges and capital expenditures.\nAs a result of the 2018 annual goodwill impairment test, the Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses as the estimated fair values of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\nGoodwill Impairment Assumptions\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company's equity and debt securities may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying amount.\nOne measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit passed\u201d (fair value exceeds carrying amount) or failed\u201d (the carrying amount exceeds fair value) the quantitative assessment. Each of the reporting units that were quantitatively assessed had fair values that exceeded the carrying amounts by between 29.3% and 125.4% of their respective estimated fair values. Relatively small changes in the Company's key assumptions would not have resulted in any reporting units being impaired.\nGenerally, changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. That is, a 1.0% decrease in estimated annual future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 1.0%. The estimated long-term net sales growth rate can have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows, and therefore, the fair value of each reporting unit. A 1.0% decrease in the long-term net sales growth rate would not have resulted in an impairment loss for any of the reporting units. Of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values, most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate. The estimated discount rate for the reporting units with operations located in the U.S. was 10.0% as of October 31, 2018. The estimated discount rate for the reporting unit with operations in foreign locations was 11.5% as of October 31, 2018. A 1.0% increase in estimated discount rates would not have resulted in an impairment loss for any of the reporting units. The Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows and discount rates are reasonable, but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making such estimates. Additionally, further price deterioration or lower volume could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and certain identifiable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company performs impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. Factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business, a significant decrease in the market value of the assets or significant negative industry or economic trends. When the Company determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. There was no impairment charge related to intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans\nOur Participation in RRD's Pension and Postretirement Benefits Plans\nRRD provided pension and other postretirement healthcare benefits to certain current and former employees of DFIN. DFIN's consolidated and combined statements of operations include expense allocations for these benefits. These allocations were funded through intercompany transactions with RRD which are reflected within net parent company investment in DFIN.\nDFIN's Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nOn October 1, 2016, DFIN recorded net pension plan liabilities of $68.3 million (consisting of a total benefit plan liability of $317.0 million, net of plan assets having fair market value of $248.7 million), as a result of the transfer of certain pension plan liabilities and assets from RRD to the Company upon the legal split of those plans. The pension plan asset allocation from RRD was finalized on June 30, 2017, which resulted in a $0.7 million decrease to the fair value of plan assets transferred to the Company from RRD. The Company also recorded a net other postretirement benefit liability of $1.5 million, as a result of the transfer of an other postretirement benefit plan from RRD to the Company.\nThe Company's primary defined benefit plan is frozen. No new employees are permitted to enter the Company's frozen plan and participants will earn no additional benefits. Benefits are generally based upon years of service and compensation. These defined benefit retirement income plans are funded in conformity with the applicable government regulations. The Company funds at least the minimum amount required for all funded plans using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under government regulations.\nThe annual income and expense amounts relating to the pension plan are based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including, mortality expectations, discount rates and expected long-term rates of return. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of December 31 (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modifies the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the consolidated balance sheets, but are amortized into operating earnings over future periods, with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors. The weighted-average discount rate for pension benefits at December 31, 2018 was 4.4%.\nA one-percentage point change in the discount rates at December 31, 2018 would have the following effects on the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0%\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0%\nDecrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accumulated benefit obligation\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Projected benefit obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's defined benefit plan has a risk management approach for its pension plan assets. The overall investment objective of this approach is to further reduce the risk of significant decreases in the plan's funded status by allocating a larger portion of the plan's assets to investments expected to hedge the impact of interest rate risks on the plan's obligation.\nThe expected long-term rate of return for the plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions and risk. In addition, the Company considered the impact of the current interest rate environment on the expected long-term rate of return for certain asset classes, particularly fixed income. The target asset allocation percentage for the pension plan was approximately 50.0% for return seeking investments and approximately 50.0% for fixed income investments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used to calculate net pension plan expense in 2018 was 6.8% for the Company's pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption that will be used to calculate net pension plan expense in 2019 is 6.3%.\nA 0.25% change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2018 would have the following effects on 2018 and 2019 pension plan (income)/expense:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0.25% increase\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0.25% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements, income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been calculated on a separate income tax return basis although, with respect to certain entities, the Company's operations prior to the Separation have historically been included in the tax returns filed by the respective RRD entities of which the Company's business was a part. As a standalone entity post-Separation, the Company files tax returns on its own behalf and its deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differ from those in historical periods.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company's tax returns are subject to audit by various U.S. and foreign tax authorities. The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. This recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be materially different from that which is reflected in the Company's historical financial statements.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax assets related to future deductible items, including domestic and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards. The Company evaluates these deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction. The utilization of these tax assets is limited by the amount of taxable income expected to be generated within the allowable carryforward period and other factors. Accordingly, management has provided a valuation allowance to reduce certain of these deferred tax assets when management has concluded that, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. If actual results differ from these estimates, or the estimates are adjusted in future periods, adjustments to the valuation allowance might need to be recorded. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, valuation allowances of $2.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, were recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period of one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete their accounting. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting is complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply its accounting on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the tax effects and recorded provisional amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, the Company revalued its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The Company recorded a reduction in the value of its net U.S. deferred tax asset of approximately $8.2 million, which was recorded as additional deferred income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Due to the transition to a territorial tax system under the Tax Act, the Company will be deemed to repatriate its foreign subsidiaries' untaxed accumulated earnings and pay a mandatory U.S. federal tax ( the transition tax\u201d) of 15.5% on the portion of the earnings that are in cash and cash equivalents and 8.0% on the portion of earnings that are in non-cash and non-cash equivalent assets. The Company estimated this tax liability (federal and state) to be approximately $14.2 million which was recorded as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a $0.1 million increase to the deemed repatriation tax liability and a $2.2 million benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adjustments were the result of the Company's completion of the analysis of the impact of the Tax Act including changes in interpretations and assumptions that the Company previously made for the prior year provisional estimates as well as the impact from additional regulatory guidance issued. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's analysis for the income tax effects of the Tax Act was completed.\nRefer to Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further detail on the accounting for income taxes and SAB 118.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, employment, commercial and other matters, as well as preference claims related to amounts received from customers and others prior to their seeking bankruptcy protection. Periodically, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the related liability is estimable, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the related potential liability and may revise its estimates.\nWith respect to claims made under the Company's third-party insurance for workers' compensation, automobile and general liability, the Company is responsible for the payment of claims below and above insured limits, and consulting actuaries are utilized to assist the Company in estimating the obligation associated with any such incurred losses, which are recorded in accrued and other non-current liabilities. Historical loss development factors for both the Company and the industry are utilized to project the future development of such incurred losses, and these amounts are adjusted based upon actual claims experience and settlements. If actual experience of claims development is significantly different from these estimates, an adjustment in future periods may be required. Expected recoveries of such losses are recorded in other current and other non-current assets.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for products and services. Specific customer provisions are made when a review of significant outstanding amounts, utilizing information about customer creditworthiness and current economic trends, indicates that collection is doubtful. In addition, provisions are made at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable and the Company's past collection experience. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $7.9 million at December 31, 2018 and $7.3 million at December 31, 2017. The Company also maintains a reserve for potential credit memos and disputed items. The credit memo and disputed items reserve is based on historical credit memos relative to billings as well as specific customer reserves and was $4.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $7.4 million at December 31, 2017. The Company's estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change, and additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the future, if any major customer's creditworthiness deteriorates or actual defaults are higher than the Company's historical experience.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than non-cancelable operating lease commitments, the Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or special purpose entities.\nFinancial Review\nIn the financial review that follows, the Company discusses its consolidated and combined results of operations, cash flows and certain other information. In periods prior to the Separation, the combined financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from RRD's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. There are limitations inherent in the preparation of all carve out financial statements due to the fact that the Company's business was previously part of a larger organization. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table shows the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services net sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 618.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 632.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 345.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>"}
