    "item_7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such difference include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nCarbon Black is a leading, global provider of cloud-delivered, next-generation endpoint security solutions. As an innovator in the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) market, our technology enables customers to address the complete endpoint security lifecycle and stay ahead of advanced cyberattacks.\nOur big data and analytics platform, the CB Predictive Security Cloud (PSC), consolidates endpoint security and IT operations into an extensible cloud platform that prevents advanced threats, provides actionable insight and enables businesses of all sizes to simplify operations. By analyzing billions of security events per day across the globe, Carbon Black has key insights into attackers' behavior patterns, enabling customers to detect, respond to and prevent emerging attacks.\nWe believe the depth, breadth and real-time nature of our unfiltered endpoint data, combined with the analytic power of our Predictive Security Cloud platform, provides customers with world-class security efficacy and operational efficiency.\nOrganizations globally are re-platforming their IT operations by investing in cloud computing and workforce mobility, which has resulted in enterprise environments that are more open, interconnected, and vulnerable to cyber attacks. Today, an increasingly mobile workforce and the explosion of enterprise data and applications in the cloud have expanded the attack surface beyond the traditional network perimeter. In response, attackers have adapted their methods and tools to directly target the endpoint. In short, the endpoint is the new perimeter.\nEndpoints are the primary focus of attacks because they store valuable data that attackers seek to steal; perform critical operations that attackers seek to disrupt; and are the interface where attackers can target humans through email, social engineering and other tactics. Endpoints are the physical and virtual locations where sensitive data resides and include desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads (services running on cloud servers), containers, fixed-function devices such as ATMs, point of sale systems, and control and data systems for power plants and other industrial assets.\nOur approach to solving these endpoint security challenges focuses on leveraging our big data and our security analytics platform in the cloud (the CB Predictive Security Cloud) to better detect and prevent the behaviors and specific techniques used by attackers. Based on our experience and investment in next-generation solutions designed to address the full endpoint security lifecycle, we have developed a highly differentiated technology approach with four main pillars: (1) unfiltered data collection, (2) proprietary data shaping technology, (3) streaming analytics, and (4) extensible open architecture.\nWe began selling our initial product in 2005, which was the precursor to CB Protection. Our initial product focused on delivering endpoint protection for desktops and servers through application control. In February 2014, we acquired Carbon Black, whose solution was the precursor to CB Response. The acquisition of Carbon Black strengthened our position as a leader in advanced threat detection and incident response management solutions, and was an important event for us as it enabled us to provide our customers with solutions designed to address the full endpoint security lifecycle. We believe that our ability to address the full lifecycle of an attack is a critical differentiator versus other endpoint security technologies that address only a portion of the attack lifecycle.\nIn more recent periods, we have focused on satisfying the increasing demand for cloud-based software from our customers and prospects and intend to continue to expand our cloud-based product offerings. In August 2015, we released a cloud-based version of CB Response to our customers under a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model. In June 2016, we acquired Confer Technologies, Inc., or Confer, whose solution is currently sold to customers as CB Defense. The acquisition of Confer was an important event for us as it added key capabilities in the areas of cloud-based, multi-tenant, big-data processing and streaming detection and prevention. With this acquisition, we also entered the next-generation antivirus market. The technology that we acquired in this acquisition is foundational to our predictive security cloud platform, which is designed to address the full endpoint security lifecycle, and to our strategy. For more information regarding the Confer acquisition, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The percentage of our total revenue generated by sales of our cloud-based solutions was 29% in 2018, 16% in 2017 and 6% in 2016. We have experienced growth in the number of customers who purchase our cloud-based solutions, with 2,851 customers in 2018, up from 1,605 customers in 2017, and 398 customers in 2016.\nA substantial majority of our customers purchase our solutions under a subscription license. Our subscription licenses include: access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud; ongoing support, which provides our customers with telephone and web-based support, bug fixes and repairs; and software updates on a when-and-if-available basis. Additionally, a substantial amount of those customers who purchase licenses on a perpetual basis also purchase an agreement for access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud. Subscription (i.e. term-based) revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date the software is delivered to the customer. Revenue for cloud-based subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the subscription beginning on the date the customer is given access to the platform. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from the infrequent sales of perpetual software licenses is recognized ratably over the customer's estimated economic life, which we have estimated to be five years, beginning on the date the software is delivered to the customer. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to perpetual licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from perpetual licenses represented less than 5% of our $198.5 million of subscription, license and support revenue in 2018. Due to our revenue recognition model, all of our subscription, license and support revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, providing us with strong visibility into future revenue.\nWe primarily sell our products through a channel partner go-to-market model, which significantly extends our global market reach and ability to rapidly scale our sales efforts. Our inside sales and field sales representatives work alongside an extensive network of value-added resellers, or VARs, distributors, managed security service providers, or MSSPs, and incident response, or IR, firms. Our MSSP and IR firm channel partners both use and recommend our products to their clients. We have established significant relationships with leading channel partners, including Optiv Security, Inc., a leading VAR and MSSP; CDW Corporation, one of the world's largest software VARs; Arrow Electronics, Inc., a major global distributor; SecureWorks, Inc., a leading MSSP; and Kroll, a leading IR firm. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, 83% and 80%, respectively, of our new and add-on business was closed in collaboration with a channel partner. We expect to continue to focus on generating sales to new and existing customers through our channel partners as a part of our growth strategy. When we transact with a channel partner, our contractual arrangement is with the channel partner and not with the end-use customer. However, whether we receive the order from a channel partner or directly from an end-use customer, our revenue recognition policy and resulting pattern of revenue recognition for the order are the same.\nOur sales team works closely with our end-use customer prospects at every stage of the sales cycle regardless of whether the prospect is sourced directly or indirectly-from initial information meetings through the implementation of our products with our end-use customers. We believe this coordinated approach to sales allows us to leverage the benefits of channel partners as well as maintain face-to-face connectivity and build long-term, trusted relationships with our customers.\nOur customers include many of the world's largest, security-focused enterprises and government agencies that are among the most heavily targeted by cyber adversaries, as well as mid-sized organizations. As of December 31, 2018, we serve over 5,000 customers globally across multiple industries, including 34 of the Fortune 100.\nWe have experienced revenue growth, with revenue increasing to $209.7 million in 2018, up from $160.8 million in 2017, and $112.9 million in 2016. This represents a 36% compound annual growth rate over the same period. We have a subscription-based revenue model that provides visibility into future revenue. Recurring revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, represented 92%, 89% and 84% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $217.0 million, $174.2 million and $124.2 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We define ARR, a non-GAAP financial measure, as the annualized value of all active subscription contracts as of the end of the period. ARR excludes revenue from perpetual licenses and services. The portion of ARR related to our cloud-based subscription contracts was $81.3 million, $46.0 million, and $15.1 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The percentage of our total recurring revenue generated by sales of our cloud-based solutions was 31%, 18%, and 7% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We incurred net losses of $82.1 million, $53.2 million, and $44.7 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as we continued to invest for growth to address the large market opportunity for our platform.\nIn May 2018, we closed our initial public offering, or IPO, of 9,200,000 shares of common stock inclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares that was exercised in full. The price per share to the public was $19.00 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $162.6 million from the IPO, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, and before deducting offering costs of $4.9 million.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis as discussed in detail in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been updated to comply with ASC 606.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our operating results will be dependent upon many factors, including our ability to capitalize on the market shift from legacy prevention offerings to next-generation endpoint security solutions, our success in growing our customer base and expanding deployments of our platform within existing customers, our ability to enhance our platform and product offerings, and our focus on maintaining strong retention rates. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last few years. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner. Additionally, we face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from legacy antivirus products, established network security products and point solutions provided by smaller security providers. We must also effectively hire, retain, train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges, our business, operating results and prospects could be adversely affected. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation, increasing market awareness of our platform, driving customer demand and a strong sales pipeline, and collaborating with our channel partners around the globe.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, primarily driven by the following factors:\nMarket Adoption. We believe our future success will depend, in large part, on the market for next-generation endpoint security. Because network-centric security is no longer adequate, organizations must focus on securing the endpoint. However, while organizations have made significant investments in upgrading to advanced network security solutions, the majority of endpoint security technology in use today relies on multiple agents and uses ineffective, traditional signature-based antivirus software. As a result, organizations are increasingly shifting their security budgets toward next-generation endpoint security solutions. We believe that we are well positioned as a market leader to capitalize on this investment cycle and that our ability to address the full lifecycle of a cyber attack will help to drive our market adoption. Additionally, the number of security professionals has not kept pace with total demand. As the number of\nthreats multiplies, legacy solutions either miss threats or produce more alerts than security teams are able to process and investigate. Organizations are increasingly turning to next-generation solutions, advanced analytics and automation tools to empower their security professionals to increase their efficiency and focus on the highest value cyber security tasks, thereby reducing the need for additional security headcount. Organizations are also addressing the talent gap by relying more on security-focused VARs and trusted partners to augment their internal teams of security experts.\nAdd New Customers. Our ability to add new customers is a key indicator of our increasing market adoption and future revenue potential. Our customer count, which includes both direct sale customers and customers with one or more subscriptions to our platform through channel partners, grew to 5,025 in 2018, up from 3,739 in 2017, and 2,516 in 2016, representing year-over-year increases of 34% in 2018 and 49% in 2017. We expect this trend to continue in future periods as we focus on adding new customers and renewing existing customers through our channel partners. We are focused on continuing to grow our customer base. We have continuously enhanced our endpoint security platform and product offerings, and we have expanded both our domestic and international sales force to drive new customer acquisition. However, our ability to continue to grow our customer base is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to compete within the increasingly competitive markets in which we participate.\nMaintain Strong Retention Rates. An important component of our revenue growth strategy is to have our existing customers renew their agreements with us. To assess our performance against this objective, we monitor the retention rate of our existing customers. We calculate retention rate by comparing the annual recurring subscription and support revenue from our customers at the beginning of a measurement period to the annual recurring subscription and support revenue from those same customers at the end of a measurement period. We divide the ending annual recurring revenue by the beginning annual recurring revenue to arrive at our retention rate metric. We exclude the impact of any add-on purchases from these customers during the measurement period; accordingly, our retention rate cannot exceed 100%. In addition, the metric reflects the loss of customers who elected not to renew contracts expiring during the measurement period. Our retention rate was 87% in 2018, 93% in 2017, and 92% in 2016.\nIncrease Sales to Existing Customers. Our current customer base provides us with a significant opportunity to drive incremental sales. Our extensible platform allows us to develop new solutions rapidly and at lower cost over time. As we develop and deploy additional security offerings on the CB Predictive Security Cloud platform, we see significant additional opportunity to cross-sell as customers benefit by addressing multiple security requirements through a single platform. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions, our ability to develop new products, pricing, economic conditions or overall reductions in our customers' spending levels.\nInvest in Growth. We will continue to focus on long-term revenue growth. We believe that our market opportunity is large and we will continue to invest significantly in research and development to enhance our technology platform and product functionality. We also expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally. In addition to our ongoing investment in research and development, we may also pursue acquisitions of businesses, technologies and assets that complement and expand the functionality of our products and services, expand the functionality of our solutions, add to our technology or security expertise, or bolster our leadership position by gaining access to new customers or markets.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics, including the following key metrics, in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance, as follows:\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBillings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n233,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n212,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear-over-year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term billings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n232,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n193,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n141,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear-over-year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n209,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n160,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n112,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear-over-year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecurring revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n192,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n142,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear-over-year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBillings. We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue during the period, excluding acquired deferred revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced to customers but that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Our deferred revenue balance primarily consists of the portion of products and support revenue that will be recognized ratably over the term of the subscription as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nMost of our revenue is derived from subscriptions to our products with a duration of one or three years. For our subscription arrangements, we typically bill our customers the fee on an annual basis for the upcoming year. For 2017, we changed our policy to require customers with multi-year contract commitments to agree to multi-year upfront billing for the total contract fee. In 2018, we reverted to our former standard practice to bill multi-year contracts on an annual basis, which resulted in lower upfront multi-year billings as compared to 2017.\nSome of our revenue is derived from perpetual licenses of our products sold with a maintenance and support agreement. For our perpetual licenses, we bill our customers the entire license fee upon delivery of the software, and for support, we typically bill our customers the support fee on an annual basis for the upcoming year.\nFor services sold on a fixed-price basis, we bill customers in advance. For services sold on a time-and-materials basis, we bill customers as such services are performed.\nWe use billings as one factor to evaluate our business because billings is an indicator of current period sales activity and provides visibility into corresponding future revenue growth due to our subscription-based revenue model. Accordingly, we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. However, it is important to note that billings, in any period, may be impacted by the timing of customer renewals, including early renewals, and customers' preferences for multi-year upfront or annual billing terms, which could favorably or unfavorably impact year-over-year comparisons. While we believe that billings is useful in evaluating our business, billings is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and billings should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, total revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate billings differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of billings as a tool for comparison. We recommend that\nyou review the reconciliation of billings to total revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on billings or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n209,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n160,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n112,857\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeferred revenue, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n192,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n168,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n116,683\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeferred revenue, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(168,700)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(116,683)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(83,883)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquired deferred revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,630)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBillings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n233,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n212,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144,027\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-term billings. We define short-term billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total revenue plus the change in current deferred revenue during the period, excluding acquired deferred revenue. We believe that short-term billings provides useful information to investors and others in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes the impact of upfront multi-year billings, which can vary from period to period depending on the timing of large, multi-year customer contracts and customer preferences for annual billing versus multi-year upfront billing. However, it is important to note that short-term billings, in any period, may be impacted by the timing of customer renewals, including early renewals, which could favorably or unfavorably impact year-over-year comparisons. While we believe that short-term billings is useful in evaluating our business, short-term billings is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and short-term billings should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, total revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP.

We define recurring revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, as subscription, license and support revenue (which includes revenue relating to support for perpetual licenses) less perpetual license revenue for the period. We use recurring revenue as one factor to evaluate our business because we believe that recurring revenue provides visibility into the revenue expected to be recognized in the current and future periods. Accordingly, we believe that recurring revenue provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. While we believe that recurring revenue is useful in evaluating our business, recurring revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and recurring revenue should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, subscription, license and support revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP.

We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow divided by total revenue. For the 2016 free cash flow calculation, we have also excluded the impact of the management incentive liability payment as this payment was not part of our core operating results. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe monitor free cash flow as one measure of our overall business performance, which enables us to analyze our future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow us to better understand the cash needs of our business. While we believe that free cash flow is useful in evaluating our business, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash used in operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison. A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is provided below. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and the reconciliation of free cash flow margin to net cash used in operating activities (as a percentage of revenue), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on free cash flow, free cash flow margin or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAs discussed above, beginning in 2018, we reverted to our former policy of offering customers who make multi-year contract commitments the option to be billed the total contract fee upfront or to be billed on an annual basis. During 2018, many customers who made a multi-year contract commitment selected to be billed on an annual basis, which resulted in less benefit to free cash flow in 2018 compared to 2017.\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(37,295)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,678)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(33,088)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100,618)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,067)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n169,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,685)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,395\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n31,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(15,430)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(16,996)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(37,295)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,678)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(33,088)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement incentive plan liability payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,985\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,041)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,145)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,776)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapitalization of internal-use software costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,319)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(922)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(411)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(45,655)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(13,745)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(25,290)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in operating activities (as a percentage of revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(4.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(29.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement incentive plan liability payment (as a percentage of revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchases of property and equipment (as a percentage of revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(3.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(5.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapitalization of internal-use software costs (as a percentage of revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(8.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(22.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP operating loss. We define non-GAAP operating loss as loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have also excluded from non-GAAP operating loss the $3.9 million expense related to the payments we agreed to make in 2018 pursuant to the Finjan legal settlement. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We consider non-GAAP operating loss to be a useful metric for investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes the impact of stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, each of which is a non-cash charge that can vary from period to period for reasons that are unrelated to our core operating performance, and expense recorded by us pursuant to the legal settlement because it is a non-recurring item. While we believe that non-GAAP operating loss is useful in evaluating our business, non-GAAP operating loss is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and non-GAAP operating loss should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, loss from operations in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP operating loss differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of non-GAAP operating loss as a tool for comparison. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of non-GAAP operating loss to loss from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on non-GAAP operating loss or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(74,561)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(52,583)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(45,734)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,356\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,780\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLegal settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-GAAP operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(55,522)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(42,064)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(34,598)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue through relationships with channel partners and through our direct sales force primarily from three sources: (i) the sale of subscription (i.e., term-based) and perpetual licenses for our CB Protection and CB Response software products along with access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud, as well as maintenance services and customer support, collectively referred to as support, (ii) cloud-based software-as-a-service, or SaaS, subscriptions for access to our CB Predictive Security Cloud software products and CB Response Cloud, and (iii) professional services and training, collectively referred to as services.\nSubscription, License and Support\nOur CB Protection and CB Response products are offered through subscription or perpetual software licenses, with a substantial majority of our customers selecting a subscription license. Subscription licenses include access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud as well as ongoing support, which provides our customers with telephone and web-based support, bug fixes and repairs and software updates on a when-and-if-available basis. Substantially all customers who purchase licenses on a perpetual basis also purchase an agreement for access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud. Subscription (i.e. term-based) revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date the\nsoftware is delivered to the customer. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from the infrequent sales of perpetual software licenses is recognized ratably over the customer's estimated economic life, which we have estimated to be five years, beginning on the date the software is delivered to the customer. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to perpetual licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied.\nDuring 2015, we began offering our CB Response product through cloud-based subscriptions. During 2016, we began offering our CB Defense product, a cloud-based next-generation antivirus solution, representing our first offering on the CB Predictive Security Cloud Platform. During 2018, we launched four new products on the CB Predictive Security Cloud Platform: CB ThreatSight, CB Defense for VMWare, CB LiveOps and CB ThreatHunter. Revenue for cloud-based subscriptions is deferred on our balance sheet and subsequently recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the subscription.\nOur term-based and cloud-based subscription agreements and perpetual license support agreements typically have one- or three-year terms. For multi-year arrangements, we typically bill on an annual basis. Prior to 2017, we typically billed multi-year arrangements on an annual basis. For 2017, we changed our policy to require customers with multi-year contract commitments to agree to multi-year upfront billing for the total contract fee. Beginning in 2018, we reverted to our former policy and offered customers who make a multi-year contract commitment the option to be billed the total contract fee upfront or to be billed on an annual basis.\nServices\nWe generate services revenue from the sale of professional services related to deployment and training services. Customers primarily purchase our professional services together with our product offerings and, to a lesser extent, on a stand-alone basis. Services are typically sold together with licenses of our software products and, to a lesser extent, on a stand-alone basis. Services are priced separately and are considered distinct from our software license. The professional services can be performed by a third party and have a history of consistent pricing by us. Professional services are sold as time-and-materials contracts based on the number of hours worked and at contractually agreed-upon hourly rates, and also on a fixed-fee basis. Revenue from professional services and training sold on a stand-alone basis or in a combined arrangement is recognized as those services are rendered as control of the services passes to the customer over time.\nAs more customers select our cloud-based offerings, we expect our services revenue to decrease in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of total revenue over time as our cloud-based offerings are typically easier to deploy.\nCost of Revenue\nOur total cost of revenue consists of the costs of subscription, license and support revenue as well as the costs of services revenue.\nCost of Subscription, License and Support Revenue\nCost of subscription, license and support revenue consists of hosting costs associated with our cloud-based offerings, personnel-related costs for our support and hosting personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and allocated overhead costs. Also included in cost of subscription, license and support revenue are costs associated with amortization of capitalized software development costs for internal-use software and amortization of developed technology intangible assets related to our prior acquisitions.\nWe expect cost of subscription, license and support revenue to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the near term due to the acceleration of our cloud-based offerings. We will incur additional personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and allocated overhead costs, for employees who support our cloud-based subscriptions and hosting services. The hosting costs for our cloud-based offerings will also increase as the number of customers who purchase our cloud-based offerings increases.\nWe expect gross margin on our subscription, license and support revenue to decline as more customers purchase our cloud-based offerings at a comparable rate to the decline from 2017 to 2018.\nCost of Services Revenue\nCost of services revenue consists of personnel-related costs for our professional services team, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation, travel expenses and allocated overhead costs. We recognize the costs of providing services when we incur them.\nWe expect cost of services revenue to decrease as more customers purchase our cloud-based subscription products, which require fewer deployment services as they are typically easier to deploy than our on-premise solutions.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nSales and marketing expense consists of personnel-related costs for our sales and marketing teams, including salaries, benefits, amortization of deferred commissions, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and other related costs. Additional expenses include costs of marketing activities and promotional events, travel, amortization of trade name and customer relationship intangible assets related to our prior acquisitions, and allocated overhead costs. We capitalize commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of customer agreements. Commissions are earned by our sales force and paid in full upon the receipt of customer orders, or bookings, for new and add-on arrangements or renewals. Commission costs are capitalized when earned and are amortized as expense over an estimated customer relationship period of five years.\nIn addition to our field sales staff, we have a dedicated channel team that works with our field and inside sales organizations to manage our relationships with channel partners and work with our channel partners to win end-use customers. As a result, our sales team works closely with our end-use customer prospects at every stage of the sales cycle regardless of whether the prospect is sourced directly or indirectly-from initial information meetings through the implementation of our products. This sales approach allows us to leverage the benefits of the channel while also building long-term, trusted relationships with our customers. Additionally, we believe this approach delivers the security expertise and support that leads to full realization of the benefits of our technology platform. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, 83% and 80%, respectively, of our new and add-on business was closed in collaboration with a channel partner.\nWe expect sales and marketing expense to remain flat in the near term.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists of personnel-related costs for our research and development team, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and other related costs. Additional expenses include subcontracting for third-party engineering resources as well as allocated overhead costs.\nWe expect research and development expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the near term as we continue to increase investments in our technology architecture and software platform.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists of personnel-related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, human resources, security, finance and accounting personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and other related costs. Additional expenses include bad debt expense related to customer receivables, recruiting costs, professional fees, travel, insurance and allocated overhead costs.\nWe expect general and administrative expense to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the near term as we continue to increase investments to support our anticipated growth.\nInterest Income, Net\nInterest income, net consists of interest income related to our invested balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as interest expense related to our outstanding debt obligations and the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount associated with such arrangements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net historically consisted primarily of gains and losses related to the revaluation of certain of our outstanding warrant liabilities, foreign currency transactions gains and losses and loss on extinguishment of debt. As of December 31, 2018, we no longer had any outstanding warrant liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of foreign income taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets with the exception of certain foreign deferred tax assets which have been determined to be more likely than not realizable.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations in dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:\nTable 180:

We experienced a slight decrease in gross margin on our subscription, license and support revenue, which comprised 83% of total revenue in 2018 and 84% in 2017. This slight decrease was primarily due to an increase in the number of customers purchasing our cloud-based subscription products during 2018 and the associated hosting and support personnel costs.

We also incurred increases of $0.3 million in allocated overhead costs, $0.2 million in software subscription costs and $0.1 million in travel costs.\nInterest Income, Net\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(518)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,272\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(106)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nInterest income, net increased by $2.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.

The benefit recognized in 2018 was due primarily to the release of a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets which were determined to be more likely than not realizable.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a benefit from income taxes of $2.2 million in the same period in 2016. The provision recognized in 2017 was due primarily to foreign income taxes. The benefit recognized in 2016 was due to the release of a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation in connection with the acquisition of Confer; otherwise, no other income tax benefit was recognized in 2017 or 2016 due to the uncertainty of realizing a benefit from our incurred losses for the periods.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our quarterly consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations data as of and for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2018.

from existing customers as they expanded their use of our solutions.\nTotal costs and expenses generally increased sequentially for the periods presented due primarily to the addition of personnel in connection with the expansion of our business and other related expenses to support our growth. We anticipate these expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to various factors affecting our performance.\nBacklog\nWe define backlog as contractually committed orders for our subscriptions and support services for which the associated revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not been invoiced. Amounts that have been invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue are reported as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in our calculation of backlog. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had backlog of approximately $38.8 million and $40.7 million, respectively. The decrease in backlog was largely due to a decrease in multi-year contract commitments\nwith annual billing. Of the amount of backlog as of December 31, 2018, we expect that approximately $27.0 million will be invoiced to customers within the following twelve months and will be initially recorded as deferred revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $160.6 million, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of highly liquid investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. treasury securities, corporate debt and asset-backed securities. As of December 31, 2018, we are party to a senior loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, or the line of credit, which, as amended, provides for $40 million in maximum borrowings. Borrowings under the line of credit accrue interest at Silicon Valley Bank's prime rate and may be repaid and reborrowed until March 21, 2020, when the line of credit expires and all outstanding amounts must be repaid. As of December 31, 2018, we had $0 of outstanding borrowings under the line of credit.\nOn May 8, 2018, we closed our initial public offering, or IPO, in which we issued and sold 9,200,000 shares of common stock inclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares that was exercised in full. The price to the public was $19.00 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $162.6 million from the IPO, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, and before deducting offering costs of approximately $4.9 million.\nSince our inception, we have generated significant losses and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, our activities related to the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies and assets, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, particularly internationally, and the introduction of new and enhanced products as we continue to innovate. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nUses of Funds\nOur historical uses of cash have consisted of cash used for operating activities, such as expansion of our sales and marketing operations, research and development activities and other working capital needs, and cash used for investing activities, including cash paid for business acquisitions and for purchases of property and equipment.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(37,295)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,678)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(33,088)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100,618)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,067)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n169,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,685)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,395\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n31,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(15,430)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(16,996)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, operating activities used $37.3 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $82.1 million, partially offset by net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $15.1 million and non-cash charges of $29.7 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted of a $24.2 million increase in deferred revenue, a $2.2 million increase in accounts payable, and a $1.8 million increase in accrued expenses, partially offset by a $8.2 million increase in deferred commissions, a $2.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $2.0 million increase in accounts receivable. The increases in deferred revenue and deferred commissions were due to increases in the number of customers and the amounts we billed for our products and services in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in the amount billed contributed to the increase in\ndeferred revenue as amounts billed for subscriptions, perpetual licenses, support and services are generally deferred on our balance sheet and subsequently recognized over the term of the subscription or maintenance period, except perpetual license revenue, which is recognized over the customer's estimated economic life, which we have estimated to be five years. The increase in accounts receivable was due to the growth of our business in 2018 compared to 2017. The increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses and other assets resulted from our increased spending due to the growth of our business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, operating activities used $7.7 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $53.2 million, partially offset by net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $29.0 million and non-cash charges of $16.5 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted of a $52.0 million increase in deferred revenue and a $4.2 million increase in accrued expenses, both partially offset by a $16.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a $8.3 million increase in deferred commissions, a $0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a $0.7 million decrease in accounts payable and a $0.4 million decrease in deferred rent. The increases in deferred revenue and deferred commissions were due to increases in the number of customers and the amounts we billed for our products and services in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in the amount billed contributed to the increase in deferred revenue as amounts billed for subscriptions, perpetual licenses, support and services are generally deferred on our balance sheet and subsequently recognized over the term of the subscription or maintenance period, except perpetual license revenue, which is recognized over the customer's estimated economic life, which we have estimated to be five years. The increase in accounts receivable was due to the growth of our business in 2017 compared to 2016. The increases in accrued expenses and prepaid expenses and other assets resulted from our increased spending due to the growth of our business. The decrease in accounts payable was due to the timing of payments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, operating activities used $33.1 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $44.7 million and net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.0 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $13.7 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a $13.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $14.0 million decrease in management incentive plan liability, a $7.4 million increase in deferred commissions and a $2.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, all partially offset by a $31.2 million increase in deferred revenue, a $3.5 million increase in accrued expenses and a $1.0 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in accounts receivable was due to the growth of our business in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in deferred revenue and deferred commissions were due to increases in the number of customers and the amounts we billed for our products and services in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in the amount billed contributed to the increase in deferred revenue as amounts billed for subscriptions, perpetual licenses, support and services are generally deferred on our balance sheet and subsequently recognized as revenue ratably over the longest service period of any deliverable in the arrangement. The increases in accrued expenses, accounts payable and in prepaid expenses and other assets resulted from our increased spending due to the growth of our business. The decrease in the management incentive plan liability was due to a $14.0 million cash payment, in addition to our issuance of 960,900 shares of common stock with a fair value of $6.0 million, to settle the management incentive plan obligation.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, investing activities used $100.6 million of cash, consisting of purchases of short-term investments of $96.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of $6.0 million and capitalization of internal-use software costs of $2.3 million, partially offset by the sale and maturities of short-term investments of $4.3 million. The purchases of property and equipment in 2018 were primarily computer equipment and software related to the growth of our headcount and general expansion of our business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, investing activities used $6.1 million of cash, consisting of purchases of property and equipment of $5.1 million and capitalization of internal-use software costs of $0.9 million. The purchases of property and equipment in 2017 were primarily related to the growth of our headcount and the general expansion of our business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, investing activities provided $0.7 million of cash, consisting of net cash of $6.9 million received in connection with our acquisition of Confer, which we funded primarily by the issuance of shares of our preferred and common stock, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $5.8 million and capitalization of internal-use software costs of $0.4 million. The purchases of property and equipment in 2016 were primarily related to the growth of our headcount and the general expansion of the business.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, financing activities provided $169.7 million of cash, resulting from $159.6 million of proceeds from the IPO and $10.1 million from the exercise of stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, financing activities used $1.7 million of cash, primarily resulting from payments of $5.6 million related to debt obligations, partially offset by proceeds of $3.9 million from the exercise of stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, financing activities provided $15.4 million of cash, primarily resulting from net proceeds of $15.4 million from the issuance of preferred stock, proceeds of $5.5 million from borrowings on our line of credit and proceeds of $2.5 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by payments of $6.1 million related to debt obligations and $1.9 million of initial public offering costs. The $15.4 million from the issuance of preferred stock included $2.0 million received upon the exercise of a customer option in connection with our acquisition of Confer, which we were then obligated to remit to the former shareholders of Confer in accordance with the merger agreement.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHosting commitments(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n48,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n22,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmounts in the table reflect a non-cancellable capacity commitment with a hosting provider under an agreement that, as amended, expires in November 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmounts in the table reflect payments due for our leases of office space that expire at various dates between April 2019 and June 2027.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized\nbelow. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue through relationships with channel partners and through its direct sales force primarily from three sources: (i) the sale of subscription (i.e., term-based) and perpetual licenses for our CB Protection and CB Response software products along with access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud, as well as maintenance services and customer support (collectively, support\u201d), (ii) cloud-based software-as-a-service, or SaaS, subscriptions for access to our CB Response and CB Defense software products, and (iii) professional services and training, collectively referred to as services.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised products or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these products or services. We apply the following five steps to recognize revenue:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe consider the terms and conditions of our contracts and our customary business practices to identify contracts under ASC 606. We consider that we have a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, we can identify each party's rights regarding the products or services to be transferred, we can identify the payment terms for the products or services to be transferred, we have determined that the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. We apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer's historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\nTable 200: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(ii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIdentification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products or services that will be transferred to the customer that are capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the products or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised products or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised products or services are capable of being distinct, and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised products or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(iii)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDetermination of the transaction price\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration that we will be entitled to in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price, if, in our judgment, it is probable that no significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will occur.\nIn instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing its products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. An example is invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period.\nTable 202: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(iv)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAllocation of the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price, or SSP, basis. We determine SSP based on the price at\nwhich the performance obligation is sold separately. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the SSP taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligation.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(v)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product or service to a customer. We recognize revenue when we transfer control of the products or services to the customer for an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.\nSubscription, License and Support Revenue\nSubstantially all of our software arrangements contain multiple performance obligations that include a combination of software licenses, cloud-based subscriptions, support, professional services and training.\nOur CB Protection and CB Response products are offered through subscription or perpetual software licenses, with a substantial majority of its customers selecting a subscription license. Subscription licenses include access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud as well as ongoing support, which provides customers with telephone and web-based support, bug fixes and repairs and software updates on a when-and-if-available basis. The CB Predictive Security Cloud automatically distributes real-time threat intelligence, such as detection algorithms, reputation scores and attack classifications, to our customers. Substantially all customers who purchase licenses on a perpetual basis also purchase an agreement for support and an agreement for access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud. For subscription or perpetual license sales of CB Protection and CB Response, we consider the software license and access to the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud to be a single performance obligation.\nSubscription (i.e. term-based) revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date the software is delivered to the customer. Revenue for cloud-based subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the subscription beginning on the date the customer is given access to the platform. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from the infrequent sales of perpetual software licenses is recognized ratably over the customer's estimated economic life, which we have estimated to be five years, beginning on the date the software is delivered to the customer. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to perpetual licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied.\nServices Revenue\nWe provide professional services to customers, primarily in the form of deployment, and training services. Services are typically sold together with licenses of our software products and, to a lesser extent, on a stand-alone basis. Services are priced separately and are considered distinct from our software license. The professional services can be performed by a third party and have a history of consistent pricing by us. Professional services are sold as time-and-materials contracts based on the number of hours worked and at contractually agreed-upon hourly rates, and also on a fixed-fee basis. Revenue from professional services and training sold on a stand-alone basis or in a combined arrangement is recognized as those services are rendered as control of the services passes to the customer over time.\nOur employees may incur out-of-pocket expenses when providing services to customers that are reimbursable from the customer under the terms of the service contract. We bill any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of these services to the customer. The expenses are classified on a gross basis as revenue and costs of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Our determination of a gross presentation is based on an assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances, including the fact that our customers, rather than us, benefit from the expenditures and we bear the credit risk of the reimbursement until it receives reimbursement from the customer.\nVariable Consideration\nRevenue is recorded at the net sales price, which is the transaction price. We do not offer refunds, rebates or credits to customers in the normal course of business. The impact of variable consideration has not been material.\nContract Costs\nWe capitalize commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of customer agreements. Commissions are earned by our sales force and paid in full upon the receipt of customer orders for new arrangements or renewals. Commission costs are capitalized when earned and are amortized as expense over an estimated customer relationship period of five years. We determined the estimated customer relationship period by taking into consideration the contractual term and expected renewals of customer contracts, our technology and other factors, including the fact that commissions paid on renewals are not commensurate with commissions paid on new sales.\nCommissions paid relating to contract renewals are deferred and amortized over the related renewal period. Costs to obtain a contract for service arrangements are expensed as incurred in accordance with the practical expedient as the contractual period for services is one year or less.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $38,154 and $29,955 of deferred commission costs in the consolidated balance sheet. Commission costs capitalized as deferred commissions during December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, totaled $20,955, $18,308 and $13,871, respectively. Amortization of deferred commissions as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $12,756, $10,047 and $6,483, respectively, and is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. We periodically review these deferred costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred sales commissions.\nWe do not incur any material costs to fulfill customer contracts.\nDeferred Revenue\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract. Such amounts are recognized as revenue over the contractual period. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized revenue of $127,487 which was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2017.\nWe receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules; accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. We generally bill customers in advance, and payment terms on invoiced amounts are typically 30 to 90 days. Contract costs include amounts related to our contractual right to consideration for completed and partially completed performance obligations that may not have been invoiced; such amounts have been insignificant to date.\nStock-Based Compensation\nPre-IPO Methodology\nPrior to our IPO, we estimated the value of common stock at the grant date with the help of an independent third party service provider. Given the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our IPO, our board of directors was required to estimate the fair value of our common stock at the time of each option grant based upon several factors, including consideration of input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations. The exercise price for all stock options granted was at the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock, as estimated on the date of grant by our board of directors in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Each fair value estimate was based on a variety of factors, which included the following:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour historical operating and financial performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na discounted cash flow analysis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe market performance of comparable publicly traded technology companies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe identification and analysis of mergers and acquisitions of comparable technology companies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to the common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering or sale given prevailing market conditions and the nature and history of our business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nany adjustments necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our common stock; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nU.S. and global economic market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPost-IPO Methodology\nFollowing the closing of our IPO, we measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Generally, we issue stock option awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.\nWe measure stock-based awards granted to non-employee consultants based on the fair value of the award on the date at which the related service is complete. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such non-employee consultants until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, we remeasure the fair value of these awards using the then-current fair value of the underlying preferred stock or common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield.\nWe estimate the fair value of each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit award based on the fair value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Application of this method of accounting requires that (i) identifiable assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed generally be measured and recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and (ii) the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment at least annually. Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred.\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the allocation of the purchase price requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain identifiable assets include, but are not limited to, the selection of valuation methodologies; estimates of future revenue and cash flows, expected long-term market growth, future expected operating expenses, costs of capital and appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, we may record certain adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the measurement period, which could last up to one year after the transaction date, all adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. We consider the following potential indicators of impairment: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value.\nWe perform an annual impairment test on December 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Significant judgments required in testing goodwill for impairment and changes in estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of whether impairment exists and, if so, the amount of that impairment.\nWe have determined that there is one reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. In testing goodwill for impairment, we first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Such qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, such as changes in management, strategy and primary customer base. We also have the option to perform step one of the goodwill impairment test. We will compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment loss is recognized. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations to reduce the carrying value of the assets to the reporting unit's implied fair value. In each of the annual goodwill impairment tests performed as of December 1, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying amount. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill.\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment, including internal-use software, and finite-lived acquired intangible assets, such as developed technology, trade name and customer relationships. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset group for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset group to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset group are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset group over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. To date, we have not recorded any impairment losses on long-lived assets. No events or changes in circumstances existed to require an impairment assessment during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nValuation of Warrant Liability\nPreferred Stock Warrants\nWe classified warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets as the warrants were free-standing financial instruments that may have required us to transfer assets upon exercise. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The warrants were initially recorded at their fair values on date of issuance, and were subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date. Changes in the fair values of the warrants were recognized as other income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUpon closing of the IPO, the warrants became warrants to purchase common stock.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nIn connection with our issuance and sale of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, we issued to an investor a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock. This warrant was exercisable upon completion of the IPO into the number of shares of common stock equal to 12.5% of the sum of (a) the number of shares into which the shares of our Series A preferred stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options to purchase shares of Series A preferred stock, convert upon an IPO and (b) the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrant. This warrant met the definition of a derivative instrument under the relevant accounting guidance and was recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the warrant on the date of issuance was recorded as reduction of the carrying value of the Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock and as a long-term liability in our consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the warrant was subsequently remeasured to its fair value at each balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of the warrant were recognized as other income or expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nUpon closing of the IPO, the common stock warrant issued in connection with the Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock became exercisable and was net exercised at an exercise price of $0.002 per share to purchase 485,985 shares of common stock.\nValuation\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates assumptions and estimates, to value the preferred stock warrants and common stock warrant that were classified as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We assessed these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions is obtained. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement included the fair value per share of the underlying common stock and Series B and Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, the remaining contractual terms of the warrants, risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields, and expected volatility of the price of the underlying common or preferred stock. We determined the fair value per share of the underlying common and preferred stock by taking into consideration our most recent sales of preferred stock, results obtained from third-party valuations, and additional factors that we deemed relevant. We have historically been a private company and lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information of our stock. Therefore, we estimated expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rates were determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual terms of the warrants. We estimated the dividend yield based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nCarrying Value and Fair Value of Preferred Stock\nWe recognized changes in the redemption values of our Series B, C, D, E, E-1 and F redeemable convertible preferred stock immediately as they occurred and adjusted the carrying value of each series of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to equal its redemption value at the end of each reporting period as if the end of each reporting period were the redemption date. Adjustments to the carrying values of the Series B, C, D, E, E-1 and F redeemable convertible preferred stock at each reporting date resulted in an increase or decrease to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders.\nBecause shares of our Series D, E and F redeemable convertible preferred stock were redeemable in an amount equal to the greater of the original issue price per share of each series plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon or the estimated fair value of the Series D, E or F redeemable convertible preferred stock at the date of the redemption request, and because shares of our Series E-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock were redeemable in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the Series E-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock at the date of the redemption request, it was necessary for us to determine the fair value of each of these series of preferred stock in order to determine the redemption value at each reporting date. As there had been no public market for our preferred stock, the estimated fair value of our preferred stock was determined by management as of each reporting date based, in part, on the results of third-party valuations of our preferred stock performed as of each reporting date as well as our assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant. These third-party valuations were performed in\naccordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our preferred stock valuations at each reporting date were prepared using either a probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM, or a hybrid method, which used a combination of market and income approaches or a market approach to estimate our enterprise value. The hybrid method is a PWERM where the equity value in one or more of the scenarios is allocated using an option-pricing method, or OPM.\nThe assumptions underlying these valuations represented our best estimates, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.\nUpon closing of the IPO, all outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into shares of common stock.\nCapitalization of Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs related to the development of software for internal use and the development of software for license or sale to customers, including costs incurred for certain upgrades and enhancements that are expected to result in increased functionality.\nCosts incurred to develop software to be licensed or sold to customers are expensed prior to the establishment of technological feasibility of the software and are capitalized thereafter until commercial release of the software. To date, we have not capitalized software development costs related to software to be licensed or sold to customers as the establishment of technological feasibility typically occurs shortly before the commercial release of our software products. As such, all software development costs related to software for license or sale to customers are expensed as incurred and included within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nQualifying costs incurred to develop internal-use software are capitalized when (1) the preliminary project stage is completed, (2) we have authorized further funding for the completion of the project and (3) it is probable that the project will be completed and performed as intended. These capitalized costs include salaries for employees who devote time directly to developing internal-use software and external direct costs of services consumed in developing the software. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Capitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years. Such amortization expense for internal-use software is classified as a cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an emerging growth company\u201d such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out\u201d of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.\nInternal-Use Software\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), or ASU 2018-15. ASU 2018-15 was issued in order to address a\ncustomer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement, or CCA that is considered a service contract. Under this guidance, implementation costs for a CCA should be evaluated for capitalization using the same approach as implementation costs associated with internal-use software. The capitalized implementation costs should be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement, which includes any reasonably certain renewal periods. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.\nStock Compensation\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), or ASU 2018-07. ASU 2018-07 was issued in order to expand the guidance for stock-based compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt ASU 2018-07 in the first quarter of 2019 and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nComprehensive Income\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, or ASU 2018-02, which provides for the reclassification of the effect of remeasuring deferred tax balances related to items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Act. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt ASU 2018-02 in the first quarter of 2019 and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or ASU 2016-02. ASU 2016-02 was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.\nWe will be adopting the new standard effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. We will not apply the standard to the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption. We will elect available practical expedients permitted under the guidance, which among other items, allow the Company to carry forward its historical lease classification and not reassess leases for the definition of lease under the new standard. Upon the adoption of ASC 842, we do not expect to record a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and plan to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet but will not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations, consolidated statement of comprehensive loss, or consolidated statement of cash flows. The most significant impact will be the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases as we expect the obligations under existing operating leases, as disclosed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, will be reported in the consolidated balance sheet upon adoption. We are currently evaluating the potential changes from this guidance to future financial reporting and disclosures and designing and implementing related processes and controls. We are still assessing the incremental borrowing rates to be used in determining the quantitative impact of adoption on our financial position.",

    "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such difference include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nCarbon Black is a leading, global provider of cloud-delivered, next-generation endpoint security solutions. As an innovator in the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) market, our technology enables customers to address the complete endpoint security lifecycle and stay ahead of advanced cyberattacks.\nOur big data and analytics platform, the CB Predictive Security Cloud (PSC), consolidates endpoint security and IT operations into an extensible cloud platform that prevents advanced threats, provides actionable insight and enables businesses of all sizes to simplify operations. By analyzing billions of security events per day across the globe, Carbon Black has key insights into attackers' behavior patterns, enabling customers to detect, respond to and prevent emerging attacks.\nWe believe the depth, breadth and real-time nature of our unfiltered endpoint data, combined with the analytic power of our Predictive Security Cloud platform, provides customers with world-class security efficacy and operational efficiency.\nOrganizations globally are re-platforming their IT operations by investing in cloud computing and workforce mobility, which has resulted in enterprise environments that are more open, interconnected, and vulnerable to cyber attacks. Today, an increasingly mobile workforce and the explosion of enterprise data and applications in the cloud have expanded the attack surface beyond the traditional network perimeter. In response, attackers have adapted their methods and tools to directly target the endpoint. In short, the endpoint is the new perimeter.\nEndpoints are the primary focus of attacks because they store valuable data that attackers seek to steal; perform critical operations that attackers seek to disrupt; and are the interface where attackers can target humans through email, social engineering and other tactics. Endpoints are the physical and virtual locations where sensitive data resides and include desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads (services running on cloud servers), containers, fixed-function devices such as ATMs, point of sale systems, and control and data systems for power plants and other industrial assets.\nOur approach to solving these endpoint security challenges focuses on leveraging our big data and our security analytics platform in the cloud (the CB Predictive Security Cloud) to better detect and prevent the behaviors and specific techniques used by attackers. Based on our experience and investment in next-generation solutions designed to address the full endpoint security lifecycle, we have developed a highly differentiated technology approach with four main pillars: (1) unfiltered data collection, (2) proprietary data shaping technology, (3) streaming analytics, and (4) extensible open architecture.\nWe began selling our initial product in 2005, which was the precursor to CB Protection. Our initial product focused on delivering endpoint protection for desktops and servers through application control. In February 2014, we acquired Carbon Black, whose solution was the precursor to CB Response. The acquisition of Carbon Black strengthened our position as a leader in advanced threat detection and incident response management solutions, and was an important event for us as it enabled us to provide our customers with solutions designed to address the full endpoint security lifecycle. We believe that our ability to address the full lifecycle of an attack is a critical differentiator versus other endpoint security technologies that address only a portion of the attack lifecycle.\nIn more recent periods, we have focused on satisfying the increasing demand for cloud-based software from our customers and prospects and intend to continue to expand our cloud-based product offerings. In August 2015, we released a cloud-based version of CB Response to our customers under a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model. In June 2016, we acquired Confer Technologies, Inc., or Confer, whose solution is currently sold to customers as CB Defense. The acquisition of Confer was an important event for us as it added key capabilities in the areas of cloud-based, multi-tenant, big-data processing and streaming detection and prevention. With this acquisition, we also entered the next-generation antivirus market. The technology that we acquired in this acquisition is foundational to our predictive security cloud platform, which is designed to address the full endpoint security lifecycle, and to our strategy. For more information regarding the Confer acquisition, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The percentage of our total revenue generated by sales of our cloud-based solutions was 29% in 2018, 16% in 2017 and 6% in 2016. We have experienced growth in the number of customers who purchase our cloud-based solutions, with 2,851 customers in 2018, up from 1,605 customers in 2017, and 398 customers in 2016.\nA substantial majority of our customers purchase our solutions under a subscription license. Our subscription licenses include: access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud; ongoing support, which provides our customers with telephone and web-based support, bug fixes and repairs; and software updates on a when-and-if-available basis. Additionally, a substantial amount of those customers who purchase licenses on a perpetual basis also purchase an agreement for access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud. Subscription (i.e. term-based) revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date the software is delivered to the customer. Revenue for cloud-based subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the subscription beginning on the date the customer is given access to the platform. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from the infrequent sales of perpetual software licenses is recognized ratably over the customer's estimated economic life, which we have estimated to be five years, beginning on the date the software is delivered to the customer. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to perpetual licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from perpetual licenses represented less than 5% of our $198.5 million of subscription, license and support revenue in 2018. Due to our revenue recognition model, all of our subscription, license and support revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, providing us with strong visibility into future revenue.\nWe primarily sell our products through a channel partner go-to-market model, which significantly extends our global market reach and ability to rapidly scale our sales efforts. Our inside sales and field sales representatives work alongside an extensive network of value-added resellers, or VARs, distributors, managed security service providers, or MSSPs, and incident response, or IR, firms. Our MSSP and IR firm channel partners both use and recommend our products to their clients. We have established significant relationships with leading channel partners, including Optiv Security, Inc., a leading VAR and MSSP; CDW Corporation, one of the world's largest software VARs; Arrow Electronics, Inc., a major global distributor; SecureWorks, Inc., a leading MSSP; and Kroll, a leading IR firm. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, 83% and 80%, respectively, of our new and add-on business was closed in collaboration with a channel partner. We expect to continue to focus on generating sales to new and existing customers through our channel partners as a part of our growth strategy. When we transact with a channel partner, our contractual arrangement is with the channel partner and not with the end-use customer. However, whether we receive the order from a channel partner or directly from an end-use customer, our revenue recognition policy and resulting pattern of revenue recognition for the order are the same.\nOur sales team works closely with our end-use customer prospects at every stage of the sales cycle regardless of whether the prospect is sourced directly or indirectly-from initial information meetings through the implementation of our products with our end-use customers. We believe this coordinated approach to sales allows us to leverage the benefits of channel partners as well as maintain face-to-face connectivity and build long-term, trusted relationships with our customers.\nOur customers include many of the world's largest, security-focused enterprises and government agencies that are among the most heavily targeted by cyber adversaries, as well as mid-sized organizations. As of December 31, 2018, we serve over 5,000 customers globally across multiple industries, including 34 of the Fortune 100.\nWe have experienced revenue growth, with revenue increasing to $209.7 million in 2018, up from $160.8 million in 2017, and $112.9 million in 2016. This represents a 36% compound annual growth rate over the same period. We have a subscription-based revenue model that provides visibility into future revenue. Recurring revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, represented 92%, 89% and 84% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $217.0 million, $174.2 million and $124.2 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We define ARR, a non-GAAP financial measure, as the annualized value of all active subscription contracts as of the end of the period. ARR excludes revenue from perpetual licenses and services. The portion of ARR related to our cloud-based subscription contracts was $81.3 million, $46.0 million, and $15.1 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The percentage of our total recurring revenue generated by sales of our cloud-based solutions was 31%, 18%, and 7% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We incurred net losses of $82.1 million, $53.2 million, and $44.7 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as we continued to invest for growth to address the large market opportunity for our platform.\nIn May 2018, we closed our initial public offering, or IPO, of 9,200,000 shares of common stock inclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares that was exercised in full. The price per share to the public was $19.00 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $162.6 million from the IPO, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, and before deducting offering costs of $4.9 million.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis as discussed in detail in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been updated to comply with ASC 606.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our operating results will be dependent upon many factors, including our ability to capitalize on the market shift from legacy prevention offerings to next-generation endpoint security solutions, our success in growing our customer base and expanding deployments of our platform within existing customers, our ability to enhance our platform and product offerings, and our focus on maintaining strong retention rates. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last few years. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner. Additionally, we face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from legacy antivirus products, established network security products and point solutions provided by smaller security providers. We must also effectively hire, retain, train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges, our business, operating results and prospects could be adversely affected. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation, increasing market awareness of our platform, driving customer demand and a strong sales pipeline, and collaborating with our channel partners around the globe.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, primarily driven by the following factors:\nMarket Adoption. We believe our future success will depend, in large part, on the market for next-generation endpoint security. Because network-centric security is no longer adequate, organizations must focus on securing the endpoint. However, while organizations have made significant investments in upgrading to advanced network security solutions, the majority of endpoint security technology in use today relies on multiple agents and uses ineffective, traditional signature-based antivirus software. As a result, organizations are increasingly shifting their security budgets toward next-generation endpoint security solutions. We believe that we are well positioned as a market leader to capitalize on this investment cycle and that our ability to address the full lifecycle of a cyber attack will help to drive our market adoption. Additionally, the number of security professionals has not kept pace with total demand. As the number of\nthreats multiplies, legacy solutions either miss threats or produce more alerts than security teams are able to process and investigate. Organizations are increasingly turning to next-generation solutions, advanced analytics and automation tools to empower their security professionals to increase their efficiency and focus on the highest value cyber security tasks, thereby reducing the need for additional security headcount. Organizations are also addressing the talent gap by relying more on security-focused VARs and trusted partners to augment their internal teams of security experts.\nAdd New Customers. Our ability to add new customers is a key indicator of our increasing market adoption and future revenue potential. Our customer count, which includes both direct sale customers and customers with one or more subscriptions to our platform through channel partners, grew to 5,025 in 2018, up from 3,739 in 2017, and 2,516 in 2016, representing year-over-year increases of 34% in 2018 and 49% in 2017. We expect this trend to continue in future periods as we focus on adding new customers and renewing existing customers through our channel partners. We are focused on continuing to grow our customer base. We have continuously enhanced our endpoint security platform and product offerings, and we have expanded both our domestic and international sales force to drive new customer acquisition. However, our ability to continue to grow our customer base is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to compete within the increasingly competitive markets in which we participate.\nMaintain Strong Retention Rates. An important component of our revenue growth strategy is to have our existing customers renew their agreements with us. To assess our performance against this objective, we monitor the retention rate of our existing customers. We calculate retention rate by comparing the annual recurring subscription and support revenue from our customers at the beginning of a measurement period to the annual recurring subscription and support revenue from those same customers at the end of a measurement period. We divide the ending annual recurring revenue by the beginning annual recurring revenue to arrive at our retention rate metric. We exclude the impact of any add-on purchases from these customers during the measurement period; accordingly, our retention rate cannot exceed 100%. In addition, the metric reflects the loss of customers who elected not to renew contracts expiring during the measurement period. Our retention rate was 87% in 2018, 93% in 2017, and 92% in 2016.\nIncrease Sales to Existing Customers. Our current customer base provides us with a significant opportunity to drive incremental sales. Our extensible platform allows us to develop new solutions rapidly and at lower cost over time. As we develop and deploy additional security offerings on the CB Predictive Security Cloud platform, we see significant additional opportunity to cross-sell as customers benefit by addressing multiple security requirements through a single platform. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions, our ability to develop new products, pricing, economic conditions or overall reductions in our customers' spending levels.\nInvest in Growth. We will continue to focus on long-term revenue growth. We believe that our market opportunity is large and we will continue to invest significantly in research and development to enhance our technology platform and product functionality. We also expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally. In addition to our ongoing investment in research and development, we may also pursue acquisitions of businesses, technologies and assets that complement and expand the functionality of our products and services, expand the functionality of our solutions, add to our technology or security expertise, or bolster our leadership position by gaining access to new customers or markets.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics, including the following key metrics, in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance, as follows:\n\nBillings. We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue during the period, excluding acquired deferred revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced to customers but that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Our deferred revenue balance primarily consists of the portion of products and support revenue that will be recognized ratably over the term of the subscription as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nMost of our revenue is derived from subscriptions to our products with a duration of one or three years. For our subscription arrangements, we typically bill our customers the fee on an annual basis for the upcoming year. For 2017, we changed our policy to require customers with multi-year contract commitments to agree to multi-year upfront billing for the total contract fee. In 2018, we reverted to our former standard practice to bill multi-year contracts on an annual basis, which resulted in lower upfront multi-year billings as compared to 2017.\nSome of our revenue is derived from perpetual licenses of our products sold with a maintenance and support agreement. For our perpetual licenses, we bill our customers the entire license fee upon delivery of the software, and for support, we typically bill our customers the support fee on an annual basis for the upcoming year.\nFor services sold on a fixed-price basis, we bill customers in advance. For services sold on a time-and-materials basis, we bill customers as such services are performed.\nWe use billings as one factor to evaluate our business because billings is an indicator of current period sales activity and provides visibility into corresponding future revenue growth due to our subscription-based revenue model. Accordingly, we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. However, it is important to note that billings, in any period, may be impacted by the timing of customer renewals, including early renewals, and customers' preferences for multi-year upfront or annual billing terms, which could favorably or unfavorably impact year-over-year comparisons. While we believe that billings is useful in evaluating our business, billings is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and billings should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, total revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate billings differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of billings as a tool for comparison. We recommend that\nyou review the reconciliation of billings to total revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on billings or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\nShort-term billings. We define short-term billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total revenue plus the change in current deferred revenue during the period, excluding acquired deferred revenue. We believe that short-term billings provides useful information to investors and others in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes the impact of upfront multi-year billings, which can vary from period to period depending on the timing of large, multi-year customer contracts and customer preferences for annual billing versus multi-year upfront billing. However, it is important to note that short-term billings, in any period, may be impacted by the timing of customer renewals, including early renewals, which could favorably or unfavorably impact year-over-year comparisons. While we believe that short-term billings is useful in evaluating our business, short-term billings is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and short-term billings should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, total revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate short-term billings differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of short-term billings as a tool for comparison. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of short-term billings to total revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on short-term billings or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\nRecurring revenue. We define recurring revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, as subscription, license and support revenue (which includes revenue relating to support for perpetual licenses) less perpetual license revenue for the period. We use recurring revenue as one factor to evaluate our business because we believe that recurring revenue provides visibility into the revenue expected to be recognized in the current and future periods. Accordingly, we believe that recurring revenue provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. While we believe that recurring revenue is useful in evaluating our business, recurring revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and recurring revenue should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, subscription, license and support revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate recurring revenue differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of recurring revenue as a tool for comparison. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of recurring revenue to subscription, license and support revenue, the\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on recurring revenue or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\nThe percentage of our total recurring revenue generated by sales of our cloud-based solutions was 31% in 2018, 18% in 2017, and 7% in 2016.\nFree cash flow and free cash flow margin. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow divided by total revenue. For the 2016 free cash flow calculation, we have also excluded the impact of the management incentive liability payment as this payment was not part of our core operating results. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe monitor free cash flow as one measure of our overall business performance, which enables us to analyze our future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow us to better understand the cash needs of our business. While we believe that free cash flow is useful in evaluating our business, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash used in operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison. A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is provided below. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and the reconciliation of free cash flow margin to net cash used in operating activities (as a percentage of revenue), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on free cash flow, free cash flow margin or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAs discussed above, beginning in 2018, we reverted to our former policy of offering customers who make multi-year contract commitments the option to be billed the total contract fee upfront or to be billed on an annual basis. During 2018, many customers who made a multi-year contract commitment selected to be billed on an annual basis, which resulted in less benefit to free cash flow in 2018 compared to 2017.\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss. We define non-GAAP operating loss as loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have also excluded from non-GAAP operating loss the $3.9 million expense related to the",
    "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such difference include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nCarbon Black is a leading, global provider of cloud-delivered, next-generation endpoint security solutions. As an innovator in the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) market, our technology enables customers to address the complete endpoint security lifecycle and stay ahead of advanced cyberattacks.\nOur big data and analytics platform, the CB Predictive Security Cloud (PSC), consolidates endpoint security and IT operations into an extensible cloud platform that prevents advanced threats, provides actionable insight and enables businesses of all sizes to simplify operations. By analyzing billions of security events per day across the globe, Carbon Black has key insights into attackers' behavior patterns, enabling customers to detect, respond to and prevent emerging attacks.\nWe believe the depth, breadth and real-time nature of our unfiltered endpoint data, combined with the analytic power of our Predictive Security Cloud platform, provides customers with world-class security efficacy and operational efficiency.\nOrganizations globally are re-platforming their IT operations by investing in cloud computing and workforce mobility, which has resulted in enterprise environments that are more open, interconnected, and vulnerable to cyber attacks. Today, an increasingly mobile workforce and the explosion of enterprise data and applications in the cloud have expanded the attack surface beyond the traditional network perimeter. In response, attackers have adapted their methods and tools to directly target the endpoint. In short, the endpoint is the new perimeter.\nEndpoints are the primary focus of attacks because they store valuable data that attackers seek to steal; perform critical operations that attackers seek to disrupt; and are the interface where attackers can target humans through email, social engineering and other tactics. Endpoints are the physical and virtual locations where sensitive data resides and include desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads (services running on cloud servers), containers, fixed-function devices such as ATMs, point of sale systems, and control and data systems for power plants and other industrial assets.\nOur approach to solving these endpoint security challenges focuses on leveraging our big data and our security analytics platform in the cloud (the CB Predictive Security Cloud) to better detect and prevent the behaviors and specific techniques used by attackers. Based on our experience and investment in next-generation solutions designed to address the full endpoint security lifecycle, we have developed a highly differentiated technology approach with four main pillars: (1) unfiltered data collection, (2) proprietary data shaping technology, (3) streaming analytics, and (4) extensible open architecture.\nWe began selling our initial product in 2005, which was the precursor to CB Protection. Our initial product focused on delivering endpoint protection for desktops and servers through application control. In February 2014, we acquired Carbon Black, whose solution was the precursor to CB Response. The acquisition of Carbon Black strengthened our position as a leader in advanced threat detection and incident response management solutions, and was an important event for us as it enabled us to provide our customers with solutions designed to address the full endpoint security lifecycle. We believe that our ability to address the full lifecycle of an attack is a critical differentiator versus other endpoint security technologies that address only a portion of the attack lifecycle.\nIn more recent periods, we have focused on satisfying the increasing demand for cloud-based software from our customers and prospects and intend to continue to expand our cloud-based product offerings. In August 2015, we released a cloud-based version of CB Response to our customers under a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model. In June 2016, we acquired Confer Technologies, Inc., or Confer, whose solution is currently sold to customers as CB Defense. The acquisition of Confer was an important event for us as it added key capabilities in the areas of cloud-based, multi-tenant, big-data processing and streaming detection and prevention. With this acquisition, we also entered the next-generation antivirus market. The technology that we acquired in this acquisition is foundational to our predictive security cloud platform, which is designed to address the full endpoint security lifecycle, and to our strategy. For more information regarding the Confer acquisition, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The percentage of our total revenue generated by sales of our cloud-based solutions was 29% in 2018, 16% in 2017 and 6% in 2016. We have experienced growth in the number of customers who purchase our cloud-based solutions, with 2,851 customers in 2018, up from 1,605 customers in 2017, and 398 customers in 2016.\nA substantial majority of our customers purchase our solutions under a subscription license. Our subscription licenses include: access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud; ongoing support, which provides our customers with telephone and web-based support, bug fixes and repairs; and software updates on a when-and-if-available basis. Additionally, a substantial amount of those customers who purchase licenses on a perpetual basis also purchase an agreement for access to and the right to utilize the threat intelligence capabilities of the CB Predictive Security Cloud. Subscription (i.e. term-based) revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date the software is delivered to the customer. Revenue for cloud-based subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the subscription beginning on the date the customer is given access to the platform. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from the infrequent sales of perpetual software licenses is recognized ratably over the customer's estimated economic life, which we have estimated to be five years, beginning on the date the software is delivered to the customer. Maintenance services and customer support revenue related to perpetual licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangement as this performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from perpetual licenses represented less than 5% of our $198.5 million of subscription, license and support revenue in 2018. Due to our revenue recognition model, all of our subscription, license and support revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, providing us with strong visibility into future revenue.\nWe primarily sell our products through a channel partner go-to-market model, which significantly extends our global market reach and ability to rapidly scale our sales efforts. Our inside sales and field sales representatives work alongside an extensive network of value-added resellers, or VARs, distributors, managed security service providers, or MSSPs, and incident response, or IR, firms. Our MSSP and IR firm channel partners both use and recommend our products to their clients. We have established significant relationships with leading channel partners, including Optiv Security, Inc., a leading VAR and MSSP; CDW Corporation, one of the world's largest software VARs; Arrow Electronics, Inc., a major global distributor; SecureWorks, Inc., a leading MSSP; and Kroll, a leading IR firm. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, 83% and 80%, respectively, of our new and add-on business was closed in collaboration with a channel partner. We expect to continue to focus on generating sales to new and existing customers through our channel partners as a part of our growth strategy. When we transact with a channel partner, our contractual arrangement is with the channel partner and not with the end-use customer. However, whether we receive the order from a channel partner or directly from an end-use customer, our revenue recognition policy and resulting pattern of revenue recognition for the order are the same.\nOur sales team works closely with our end-use customer prospects at every stage of the sales cycle regardless of whether the prospect is sourced directly or indirectly-from initial information meetings through the implementation of our products with our end-use customers. We believe this coordinated approach to sales allows us to leverage the benefits of channel partners as well as maintain face-to-face connectivity and build long-term, trusted relationships with our customers.\nOur customers include many of the world's largest, security-focused enterprises and government agencies that are among the most heavily targeted by cyber adversaries, as well as mid-sized organizations. As of December 31, 2018, we serve over 5,000 customers globally across multiple industries, including 34 of the Fortune 100.\nWe have experienced revenue growth, with revenue increasing to $209.7 million in 2018, up from $160.8 million in 2017, and $112.9 million in 2016. This represents a 36% compound annual growth rate over the same period. We have a subscription-based revenue model that provides visibility into future revenue. Recurring revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, represented 92%, 89% and 84% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $217.0 million, $174.2 million and $124.2 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We define ARR, a non-GAAP financial measure, as the annualized value of all active subscription contracts as of the end of the period. ARR excludes revenue from perpetual licenses and services. The portion of ARR related to our cloud-based subscription contracts was $81.3 million, $46.0 million, and $15.1 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The percentage of our total recurring revenue generated by sales of our cloud-based solutions was 31%, 18%, and 7% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We incurred net losses of $82.1 million, $53.2 million, and $44.7 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as we continued to invest for growth to address the large market opportunity for our platform.\nIn May 2018, we closed our initial public offering, or IPO, of 9,200,000 shares of common stock inclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares that was exercised in full. The price per share to the public was $19.00 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $162.6 million from the IPO, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions, and before deducting offering costs of $4.9 million.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis as discussed in detail in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been updated to comply with ASC 606.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our operating results will be dependent upon many factors, including our ability to capitalize on the market shift from legacy prevention offerings to next-generation endpoint security solutions, our success in growing our customer base and expanding deployments of our platform within existing customers, our ability to enhance our platform and product offerings, and our focus on maintaining strong retention rates. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last few years. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner. Additionally, we face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from legacy antivirus products, established network security products and point solutions provided by smaller security providers. We must also effectively hire, retain, train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges, our business, operating results and prospects could be adversely affected. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation, increasing market awareness of our platform, driving customer demand and a strong sales pipeline, and collaborating with our channel partners around the globe.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nOur historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, primarily driven by the following factors:\nMarket Adoption. We believe our future success will depend, in large part, on the market for next-generation endpoint security. Because network-centric security is no longer adequate, organizations must focus on securing the endpoint. However, while organizations have made significant investments in upgrading to advanced network security solutions, the majority of endpoint security technology in use today relies on multiple agents and uses ineffective, traditional signature-based antivirus software. As a result, organizations are increasingly shifting their security budgets toward next-generation endpoint security solutions. We believe that we are well positioned as a market leader to capitalize on this investment cycle and that our ability to address the full lifecycle of a cyber attack will help to drive our market adoption. Additionally, the number of security professionals has not kept pace with total demand. As the number of\nthreats multiplies, legacy solutions either miss threats or produce more alerts than security teams are able to process and investigate. Organizations are increasingly turning to next-generation solutions, advanced analytics and automation tools to empower their security professionals to increase their efficiency and focus on the highest value cyber security tasks, thereby reducing the need for additional security headcount. Organizations are also addressing the talent gap by relying more on security-focused VARs and trusted partners to augment their internal teams of security experts.\nAdd New Customers. Our ability to add new customers is a key indicator of our increasing market adoption and future revenue potential. Our customer count, which includes both direct sale customers and customers with one or more subscriptions to our platform through channel partners, grew to 5,025 in 2018, up from 3,739 in 2017, and 2,516 in 2016, representing year-over-year increases of 34% in 2018 and 49% in 2017. We expect this trend to continue in future periods as we focus on adding new customers and renewing existing customers through our channel partners. We are focused on continuing to grow our customer base. We have continuously enhanced our endpoint security platform and product offerings, and we have expanded both our domestic and international sales force to drive new customer acquisition. However, our ability to continue to grow our customer base is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to compete within the increasingly competitive markets in which we participate.\nMaintain Strong Retention Rates. An important component of our revenue growth strategy is to have our existing customers renew their agreements with us. To assess our performance against this objective, we monitor the retention rate of our existing customers. We calculate retention rate by comparing the annual recurring subscription and support revenue from our customers at the beginning of a measurement period to the annual recurring subscription and support revenue from those same customers at the end of a measurement period. We divide the ending annual recurring revenue by the beginning annual recurring revenue to arrive at our retention rate metric. We exclude the impact of any add-on purchases from these customers during the measurement period; accordingly, our retention rate cannot exceed 100%. In addition, the metric reflects the loss of customers who elected not to renew contracts expiring during the measurement period. Our retention rate was 87% in 2018, 93% in 2017, and 92% in 2016.\nIncrease Sales to Existing Customers. Our current customer base provides us with a significant opportunity to drive incremental sales. Our extensible platform allows us to develop new solutions rapidly and at lower cost over time. As we develop and deploy additional security offerings on the CB Predictive Security Cloud platform, we see significant additional opportunity to cross-sell as customers benefit by addressing multiple security requirements through a single platform. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions, our ability to develop new products, pricing, economic conditions or overall reductions in our customers' spending levels.\nInvest in Growth. We will continue to focus on long-term revenue growth. We believe that our market opportunity is large and we will continue to invest significantly in research and development to enhance our technology platform and product functionality. We also expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base, both domestically and internationally. In addition to our ongoing investment in research and development, we may also pursue acquisitions of businesses, technologies and assets that complement and expand the functionality of our products and services, expand the functionality of our solutions, add to our technology or security expertise, or bolster our leadership position by gaining access to new customers or markets.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics, including the following key metrics, in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance, as follows:\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBillings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n233,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n212,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear-over-year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term billings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n232,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n193,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n141,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear-over-year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n209,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n160,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n112,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear-over-year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecurring revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n192,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n142,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nYear-over-year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBillings. We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue during the period, excluding acquired deferred revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced to customers but that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Our deferred revenue balance primarily consists of the portion of products and support revenue that will be recognized ratably over the term of the subscription as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nMost of our revenue is derived from subscriptions to our products with a duration of one or three years. For our subscription arrangements, we typically bill our customers the fee on an annual basis for the upcoming year. For 2017, we changed our policy to require customers with multi-year contract commitments to agree to multi-year upfront billing for the total contract fee. In 2018, we reverted to our former standard practice to bill multi-year contracts on an annual basis, which resulted in lower upfront multi-year billings as compared to 2017.\nSome of our revenue is derived from perpetual licenses of our products sold with a maintenance and support agreement. For our perpetual licenses, we bill our customers the entire license fee upon delivery of the software, and for support, we typically bill our customers the support fee on an annual basis for the upcoming year.\nFor services sold on a fixed-price basis, we bill customers in advance. For services sold on a time-and-materials basis, we bill customers as such services are performed.\nWe use billings as one factor to evaluate our business because billings is an indicator of current period sales activity and provides visibility into corresponding future revenue growth due to our subscription-based revenue model. Accordingly, we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. However, it is important to note that billings, in any period, may be impacted by the timing of customer renewals, including early renewals, and customers' preferences for multi-year upfront or annual billing terms, which could favorably or unfavorably impact year-over-year comparisons. While we believe that billings is useful in evaluating our business, billings is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and billings should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, total revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate billings differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of billings as a tool for comparison. We recommend that\nyou review the reconciliation of billings to total revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on billings or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n209,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n160,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n112,857\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeferred revenue, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n192,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n168,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n116,683\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeferred revenue, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(168,700)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(116,683)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(83,883)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquired deferred revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,630)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBillings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n233,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n212,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144,027\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-term billings. We define short-term billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total revenue plus the change in current deferred revenue during the period, excluding acquired deferred revenue. We believe that short-term billings provides useful information to investors and others in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes the impact of upfront multi-year billings, which can vary from period to period depending on the timing of large, multi-year customer contracts and customer preferences for annual billing versus multi-year upfront billing. However, it is important to note that short-term billings, in any period, may be impacted by the timing of customer renewals, including early renewals, which could favorably or unfavorably impact year-over-year comparisons. While we believe that short-term billings is useful in evaluating our business, short-term billings is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and short-term billings should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, total revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate short-term billings differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of short-term billings as a tool for comparison.

We define recurring revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, as subscription, license and support revenue (which includes revenue relating to support for perpetual licenses) less perpetual license revenue for the period. We use recurring revenue as one factor to evaluate our business because we believe that recurring revenue provides visibility into the revenue expected to be recognized in the current and future periods. Accordingly, we believe that recurring revenue provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. While we believe that recurring revenue is useful in evaluating our business, recurring revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and recurring revenue should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, subscription, license and support revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate recurring revenue differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of recurring revenue as a tool for comparison. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of recurring revenue to subscription, license and support revenue, the\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on recurring revenue or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubscription, license and support revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n198,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n148,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n101,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPerpetual license revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,263)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,408)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,799)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecurring revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n192,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n142,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRecurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe percentage of our total recurring revenue generated by sales of our cloud-based solutions was 31% in 2018, 18% in 2017, and 7% in 2016.\nFree cash flow and free cash flow margin. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow divided by total revenue. For the 2016 free cash flow calculation, we have also excluded the impact of the management incentive liability payment as this payment was not part of our core operating results. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe monitor free cash flow as one measure of our overall business performance, which enables us to analyze our future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow us to better understand the cash needs of our business. While we believe that free cash flow is useful in evaluating our business, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash used in operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison. A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is provided below. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and the reconciliation of free cash flow margin to net cash used in operating activities (as a percentage of revenue), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provided below, and that you not rely on free cash flow, free cash flow margin or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAs discussed above, beginning in 2018, we reverted to our former policy of offering customers who make multi-year contract commitments the option to be billed the total contract fee upfront or to be billed on an annual basis. During 2018, many customers who made a multi-year contract commitment selected to be billed on an annual basis, which resulted in less benefit to free cash flow in 2018 compared to 2017.\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(37,295)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,678)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(33,088)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100,618)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,067)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n169,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,685)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,395\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n31,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(15,430)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(16,996)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(37,295)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,678)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(33,088)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement incentive plan liability payment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,985\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,041)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,145)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,776)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapitalization of internal-use software costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,319)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(922)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(411)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(45,655)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(13,745)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(25,290)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in operating activities (as a percentage of revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(4.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(29.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement incentive plan liability payment (as a percentage of revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchases of property and equipment (as a percentage of revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(3.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(5.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapitalization of internal-use software costs (as a percentage of revenue)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(0.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFree cash flow margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(21.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(8.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(22.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP operating loss.
