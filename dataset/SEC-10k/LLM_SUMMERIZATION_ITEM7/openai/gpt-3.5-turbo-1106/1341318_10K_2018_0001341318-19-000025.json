Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nThis discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K, and the other statistical data provided in this Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nImportant Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\ufeff\nCertain statements in this annual report are forward-looking\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may,\u201d will,\u201d expect,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d target,\u201d plan,\u201d project\u201d or continue\u201d or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or similar terminology, and are made on the basis of management's current plans and analyses of our business and the industry in which we operate as a whole. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, competition, interest rate sensitivity and exposure to regulatory and legislative changes, and the other risks and uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d These factors in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our financial performance and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements if future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.\nGeneral Overview of the Company's Activities and Risks\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans and investments and the interest expense we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on these balances.\nOur operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges and fees and gains and losses on the sales of securities and loans, our provision for loan losses and non-interest expenses which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional services, advertising and other general and administrative expenses.\nFinancial institutions like us, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are principally concentrated in the Western New York area, and our operations and earnings are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations are also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact the Company.\nTo operate successfully, we must manage various types of risk, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational and information technology risks, strategic risk, reputation risk and compliance risk. A significant form of market risk for the Company is interest rate risk, as the Company's assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. Net interest income is our primary source of revenue and interest rate risk is a significant non-credit related risk to which our Company is exposed. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of our assets and liabilities. In addition to directly impacting net interest income, changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers and debt issuers to repay loans and debt securities, the volume of loan\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrepayments and refinancings, the flow and mix of deposits and the fair value of available for sale securities. In recent years, the Company has adjusted its strategies to manage interest rate risk by originating a greater volume of shorter-term, adjustable rate commercial real estate and commercial business loans and increasing its concentration of core deposits, which are less interest rate sensitive. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of $3.0 million to convert a portion of its fixed rate residential, one- to four-family real estate loans into adjustable rate interest-earning assets, to better manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.\nCredit risk is also a significant form of risk for the Company. Credit risk is the risk to our earnings and stockholders' equity that results from customers, to whom loans have been made, and from issuers of debt securities in which the Company has invested, failing to repay their obligations. The magnitude of risk depends on the capacity and willingness of borrowers and debt issuers to repay and the sufficiency of the value of collateral obtained to secure the loans made or investments purchased. This risk is managed by policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors, review of compliance with the policies and periodic reporting and evaluation of loans or securities that are non-performing or demonstrate other characteristics of potential loss.\n\ufeff\nManagement Strategy\nOur Reputation. Our primary management strategy has been to maintain our position as an authentic community bank, locally headquartered in Western New York, with over 127 years of service to our community. Our management team strives to accomplish this goal by continuing to emphasize our exceptional individualized customer service and financial strength, continued community involvement, effective risk management, strong capital levels, technological services and penetration in our market areas via organic growth of loans and deposits.\nBranding and Marketing. We currently operate eleven full-service branch offices throughout Western New York, where our branch teams initiate and develop both consumer and commercial customer relationships in and around the surrounding market areas. We offer concierge banking services, together with our online and mobile customer conveniences, creating a truly individualized approach for customers to manage their finances whenever, wherever and however they wish. As a true local bank, we pride ourselves on offering competitive products delivered with the individualized service our customers have come to expect. Our experienced team of commercial bankers can meet the needs of nearly any type of business through a variety of checking and credit products, and banking services. Our team members live and work right here in our Western New York communities and can fully understand the specific challenges and opportunities our customers face daily. As the banking industry continues to evolve to meet the rapidly increasing demands of those we serve, specifically in the area of technological conveniences, we must continually listen keenly to our customers, and remain proactive in our efforts to provide the unparalleled service they have come to expect. From local decision-making, responding quickly and efficiently to customer needs, and utilizing technology to level the playing field with our competitors, we are committed to developing long-term relationships with our customers. Staying true to our local roots and mission of Putting People First\u201d continues to uniquely position us as a bank of choice in Western New York.\nTechnology. An important strategic objective is to continue to evaluate and enhance the technology supporting our customer service. We are committed to making investments in technology and we believe that it represents an efficient way to deploy a portion of our capital. To this end, the Company has developed a five year plan for the implementation of cost effective and efficient digital services to meet our customer's technology needs, to focus on attracting new customers, and to improve our operational efficiencies. Although we remain committed to expanding our retail branch footprint whenever it makes strategic sense, we will be concentrating our near term efforts on expanding our digital footprint.\nOur People. A large part of our success is related to customer service and customer satisfaction. Having employees who understand and value our clientele and their business is a key component to our success. We believe that our present staff is one of our competitive strengths, and thus the retention of such persons and our ability to continue to attract quality personnel is a high priority.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nLending. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio with emphasis on the origination of short-term adjustable rate commercial real estate, commercial business and home equity loans, while maintaining strong underwriting and asset quality. Historically, our lending portfolio has consisted predominantly of residential one- to four-family mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, residential one- to four-family mortgage loans (including loans to finance the construction of one- to four-family homes) constituted 39.5% and 39.6%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio at such respective dates. In the past, we have sold low-yield long-term conforming fixed rate one- to four-family residential loans that we originated on the secondary market, as part of our interest rate risk strategy and asset/liability management, and may do so in the future, if it is deemed appropriate. We typically retain servicing rights when we sell one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.\nDue to the interest rate risk inherent in holding long-term, fixed rate one- to four-family real estate loans in our portfolio, we have been strategically focused on increasing the originations of commercial real estate loans to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of developed real estate. We have also focused on commercial business lending to small businesses, including business installment loans, lines of credit and other commercial loans. These types of commercial loans are generally made at higher interest rates and for shorter terms than one- to four-family real estate loans, which reduces the Bank's interest rate risk. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our commercial real estate loan portfolio (including loans to finance the construction of commercial real estate) represented the largest holdings in our loan portfolio at 44.0% and 42.0%, respectively, of total loans.\n\ufeff\nCommercial business loans, home equity loans and consumer loans provide diversification to our loan portfolio while meeting the needs of our customers. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our commercial business loan portfolio represented 5.6% and 7.6%, respectively, of total loans, while the home equity loan portfolio represented 10.7% and 10.4%, of total loans, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAsset Quality. We remain committed to maintaining prudent underwriting standards and aggressively monitoring our loan portfolio to maintain asset quality. We introduce loan products only when we are confident that our staff has the necessary expertise to originate and administer such loans, and that sound underwriting and collection procedures are in place. Our goal is to continue to improve our asset quality through prudent underwriting standards and the diligence of our loan collection personnel. At December 31, 2018, our ratio of non-performing loans to total net loans was 0.82% as compared to 1.05% at December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nInvestment Portfolio. Our investment policy is designed primarily to complement our lending and deposit activities and to provide and maintain liquidity within established guidelines, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. We employ a third party financial advisor to assist us in managing our investment portfolio and developing balance sheet strategies.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $86.2 million and $80.4 million, respectively, invested in securities available for sale, the majority of which are agency collateralized mortgage obligation securities ( CMOs\u201d), agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. At December 31, 2018, we had a $165,000, net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio as compared to a $1.2 million net unrealized gain as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in the net unrealized gain during 2018 was due to an increase in market interest rates, which had a negative impact on the market value of our securities portfolio as demand increased for new-issue securities with higher rates.\nAsset Liability Management. As mentioned earlier in this report, our business consists primarily of originating commercial real estate loans and one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by properties in our market area and investing in residential mortgage backed securities, CMOs and municipal securities. One- to four-family residential real estate loans generally involve a lower degree of credit risk and carry a lower yield than commercial real estate and commercial business loans. The average maturity of residential real estate loans is longer than that for commercial loans. Our loans are primarily funded by core deposits (i.e. checking, savings and money market accounts) and time deposits (which typically mature within 2 to 3 years on average). As a\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nresult, we are exposed to interest rate risk, as our interest-bearing liabilities will mature or re-price more quickly than our interest-earning assets in a rising rate environment. A key part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The Asset and Liability Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk and the Asset and Liability Committee meets at least quarterly to review the interest rate risk position.\nAlthough we plan to continue to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans going forward, we have been and intend to continue to increase our focus on the origination of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans. Commercial loans generally have adjustable rates, higher returns and shorter durations than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, thereby reducing interest rate risk levels. As part of our asset liability strategy, we review the duration of assets on our balance sheet, and if necessary, we may sell loans or securities to help manage our interest rate risk.\nOur strategy also involves managing interest expense. In recent years, we have decreased the amount of higher-cost fixed rate time deposits and have concentrated on building lower-cost core deposits. We offer competitive rates on a variety of deposit products to meet the needs of our customers and to meet asset-liability goals. We also consider borrowed funds or brokered deposits to supplement our deposit portfolio or liquidity requirements, as needed.\nWe are actively involved in managing our balance sheet through the direction of our Asset-Liability Committee and the assistance of a third party advisor. Historic economic conditions have underscored the importance of a strong balance sheet. We strive to achieve this through managing our interest rate risk and maintaining strong capital levels, putting aside adequate loan loss reserves and keeping liquid assets on hand. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of $3.0 million to convert a portion of its fixed rate residential, one- to four-family real estate loans into adjustable rate interest-earning assets, to better manage its exposure to movements in interest rates. In addition to the interest rate swap arrangement, we have diversified our asset mix during the last three years, which may result in improved net interest margins and reduced exposure of our net interest income and earnings to interest rate risk. We will continue to manage our interest rate risk by diversifying the type and maturity of assets in our loan and investment portfolios and monitoring the maturities in our deposit portfolio and borrowing facilities.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIt is management's opinion that accounting estimates covering certain aspects of our business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity required in making such estimates.\n\ufeff\nAllowance for loan losses. Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses required for probable credit losses and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations. Management's monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance considers our historical loan loss experience, review of specific loans that are past due or where management has knowledge of possible credit problems, current economic conditions, and such other factors considered appropriate to estimate loan losses. Management uses presently available information to estimate probable losses on loans; however, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in estimates, assumptions, or economic conditions. Significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions in our local market areas, concentrations of risk or a decline in local property values. The Company's determination as to the amount of its allowance for loan losses is subject to review by its bank regulators, which can require the establishment of additional loss allowances. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the allowance for loan losses.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nInvestment Valuations. In management's opinion, the accounting policy relating to the valuation of investments is a critical accounting policy. We use a third party vendor to provide independent pricing of the securities in our investment portfolio. The third party vendor utilizes public quotations, third party dealer quotes and pricing models. The determination of fair value pricing on investments may require significant judgment or estimation, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the item being valued. The use of different assumptions for these valuations could produce significantly different results which may have material positive or negative effects on the results of our operations. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on fair value.\nImpairment of Investments. Management also considers the accounting policy relating to the impairment of investments to be a critical accounting policy due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the material effect an impairment loss could have on the consolidated results of income. The credit portion of a decline in the fair market value of investments below cost deemed to be other-than-temporary ( OTTI\u201d) may be charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for an asset. Management continually reviews the current value of its investments for evidence of OTTI. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on OTTI.\nThese critical policies and their application are reviewed periodically by our Audit/Risk Committee and our Board of Directors. All accounting policies are important, and as such, we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in the notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements to better understand how our financial performance is reported.\n\ufeff\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as commercial and residential mortgage loans and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on them.\n\ufeff\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields. The following table sets forth certain information relating to our average balance sheets and reflects the average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the years indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the years indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for loan losses, but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nyields. Interest income on securities does not include a tax equivalent adjustment for bank qualified municipal bonds.\n\ufeff\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

The following table analyzes the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table shows the amount of the change in interest income or expense caused by either changes in outstanding balances (volume) or changes in interest rates. The effect of a change in volume is measured by applying the average rate during the first year to the volume change between the two years. The effect of changes in rate is measured by applying the change in rate between the two years to the average volume during the first year. Changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the absolute value of the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\n\ufeff\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

During 2018 the Company strategically offered competitive rates on money market products as a way to raise funds for loan growth and to shift our deposit mix away from longer duration, fixed rate time deposits in an effort to manage interest rate risk. As the Federal Reserve raised short term interest rates by 100 basis points during 2018, all banks experienced an increase in the cost of funds, as consumers preferred higher rates and longer terms on deposit products, resulting in an increase in time deposits.\n\ufeff\nOur borrowings, consisting of advances from the FHLBNY, decreased by $2.3 million, or 8.5%, from $27.0 million at December 31, 2017 to $24.7 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was due to the use of excess liquidity to pay off long-term debt which matured during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nTotal stockholders' equity increased by $1.4 million, or 1.8%, from $78.4 million at December 31, 2017 to $79.8 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily due to net income of $4.0 million and a $197,000 increase in additional paid in capital attributed to stock based compensation, partially offset by $1.4 million of treasury stock repurchases, $880,000 in cash dividends paid and $818,000 in other comprehensive losses during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n\ufeff\nGeneral. Net income was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of $662,000, or 18.4%, compared to net income of $3.4 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected a $1.2 million increase in net interest income, a $600,000 decrease in income tax expense and a $120,000 decrease in provision for loan losses which was partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in non-interest expenses and a $181,000 decrease in non-interest income when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased by $1.2 million, or 6.9%, to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest income and interest expense both increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest rate spread and net interest margin were 3.43% and 3.61%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 3.45% and 3.61%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nInterest Income. Interest income increased by $2.1 million, or 11.0%, to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in loan interest income. Loan interest income increased by $1.6 million, or 9.8%, to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a $27.3 million, or 7.8%, increase in the average balance of loans from $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $379.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the average balance of loans was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of commercial real estate, commercial business and home equity loans, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of residential one-to four-family loans. The average yield on the loan portfolio was 4.83% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 4.74% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2018 increase in the average yield was primarily due to an increase in higher yielding commercial real estate loans and an increase in market interest rates. The 2018 increase in average yield was partially impacted by the prior year receipt of $202,000 of interest income on one non-performing commercial real estate loan which paid off during 2017. The average yield on the loan portfolio would have been 4.68% for the year ended December 31, 2017 if the $202,000 of interest income received on the non-performing loan payoff was excluded.\nInvestment income increased $193,000, or 7.9%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The average balance and average yield on the investment portfolio increased from $80.5 million and 3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $84.4 million and 3.13% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the average balance and average yield of the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninvestment portfolio was primarily due to the purchase of higher yielding securities, which was partially offset by paydowns received on lower yielding securities since December 31, 2017.\nOther interest income increased by $302,000, or 111.9%, to $572,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 93 basis points increase in the average yield on the interest earning deposits and federal funds sold portfolio. The average yield increased from 0.85% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 1.78% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average yield increased as a result of a 100 basis points increase in the fed funds rate by the Federal Reserve since December 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $972,000, or 37.0%, to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in interest paid on deposits. Interest paid on deposits increased by $897,000, or 43.1%, to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense was primarily impacted by a 39 and 22 basis points increase, respectively, in the average interest rates paid on money market and time deposit accounts as a result of the increase in short term market interest rates since December 31, 2017. The increase in deposit interest expense was also due to an increase in the average balance of deposits since December 31, 2017; specifically a $27.7 million increase in average money market account balances and a $2.8 million increase in average time deposit balances. The increase in the average balance of money market accounts was primarily due to competitive rates being offered on these products in an effort to attract funds for loan growth.The average balance and average yield of the deposit portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $368.3 million and 0.81%, respectively, as compared to $338.7 million and 0.61%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe interest expense related to advances from the FHLBNY increased $80,000, or 17.1%, to $548,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in the average balance and average rate of FHLBNY advances. The average balance of advances from the FHLBNY for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $25.7 million with an average rate of 2.13% compared to an average balance of $23.1 million and an average rate of 2.03% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Bank increased borrowings in order to take advantage of low cost fixed-rates to fund loan growth. The increase in the average rate paid on borrowings was primarily due to the increase in market interest rates since the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A $390,000 provision to the allowance for loan losses was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was a $120,000, or 23.5%, decrease in comparison to the provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in provision expense was primarily due to a higher provision being recorded for the downgrade in loan classification for two commercial loan relationships during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, these specific commercial loans were performing, and well collateralized by commercial real estate, as well as fixtures and equipment.\n\ufeff\nThe $390,000 provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of a comprehensive evaluation that is completed on a quarterly basis. The quarterly evaluations reflect analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience, supplemented as necessary by credit judgment that considers observable trends, conditions, and other relevant environmental and economic factors. The evaluation for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of the following:\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$537,000 net provision for commercial real estate loans, which included a:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$326,000 general allowance on performing commercial real estate loans; primarily due to a $27.7 million, or 22.6%, increase in this segment of the loan portfolio since December 31, 2017, to reflect inherent losses within the portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$181,000 specific allowance related to charge-offs on two previously impaired commercial real estate loans that were foreclosed upon during the year ended December 31, 2018; and a\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$30,000 specific allowance related to the impairment of one commercial real estate loan during the year ended December 31, 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$97,000 credit provision on construction - commercial real estate loans as a result of an $8.6 million, or 27.8%, decrease in this segment of the loan portfolio since December 31, 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$38,000 credit provision for commercial business loans, which included a:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$59,000 credit provision as a result of a $5.8 million, or 21.0%, decrease in this segment of the loan portfolio since December 31, 2017; which was partially offset by a\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$21,000 net provision to reflect an increase in reserves on criticized and classified commercial business loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$35,000 net credit provision on one-to four-family, home equity, construction - one- to four- family and consumer loans which reflected a:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$77,000 credit provision for changes in the related environmental factors used to qualitatively assess inherent loan losses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$18,000 credit provision to reflect a decrease in the historical average net charge-off rate for these loan types over the last five years; which was partially offset by a\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$14,000 provision associated with the net $14.0 million, or 7.6%, increase in loan growth for these loan types during 2018 to reflect inherent losses on new loan originations; and a\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\no\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$46,000 specific provision related to net charge-offs recorded on these loan types during the year ended December 31, 2018; and a\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$23,000 unallocated provision for loan losses to reflect the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general losses in the portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $510,000 provision to the allowance for loan losses.

Non-interest income decreased by $181,000, or 6.8%, from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily attributed to there being no sales of securities during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to a $244,000 pre-tax realized gain on the sale of securities during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was also due to a $37,000 decrease in other income which was partially offset by a $56,000 increase in service charges and fees and a $34,000 increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nNon-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses increased by $1.1 million, or 7.5%, from $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $752,000, or 9.9%, primarily due to annual salary increases and increases in health insurance and retirement benefits. Professional services increased by $109,000, or 12.5%, primarily due to an increase in legal expenses during 2018. Data processing increased by $70,000, or 5.6%, primarily due to implementation of new technology and growth in deposit and loan accounts. Occupancy and equipment increased by $64,000, or 2.8%, primarily due to increases in repair and building maintenance costs and software and technology maintenance costs. Other expenses increased by $77,000, or 5.9%, primarily due to increases in training costs and collection and foreclosure expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense decreased by $600,000, or 50.6%, from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $585,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a reduction in the effective tax rate to 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Act, which lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The Tax Act was enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017 and generally accepted accounting principles required that the impact of the provisions in the Tax Act be accounted for in the period of enactment. As such, the Company was required to revalue its net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017, to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate, resulting in a one-time $262,000 net income tax expense adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2017. The impact of the lower corporate tax rate during 2018 was partially offset by a decrease in the mix of tax-exempt income derived from our municipal bond portfolio and bank-owned life insurance in relation to our pre-tax income for the current year.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nGeneral. Net income was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or $0.55 per diluted share, a decrease of $137,000, or 3.9%, compared to net income of $3.5 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflected a $1.4 million decrease in non-interest income, a $481,000 increase in non-interest expense and a $410,000 increase in income tax expense, which was partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in net interest income and a $615,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $1.6 million pre-tax realized gain on the sale of securities during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a $244,000 pre-tax realized gain on the sale of securities during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 was partially due to the recognition of a $262,000 net tax expense as a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% under the Tax Act enacted in December 2017. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate required revaluation of net deferred tax assets\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nat the time of enactment. The remaining increase in income tax expense was attributed to an increase in pre-tax income for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased by $1.6 million, or 10.2%, to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest income and interest expense both increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest rate spread and net interest margin were 3.45% and 3.61%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.29% and 3.44%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the interest rate spread and net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a 22 basis point increase in the average interest rate received on interest-earning assets partially offset by a 6 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.\n\ufeff\nInterest Income. Interest income increased by $1.9 million, or 10.8%, to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in loan interest income. Loan interest income increased by $2.2 million, or 15.1%, to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $39.9 million, or 12.8%, increase in the average balance of loans from $312.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in the average balance of loans was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of commercial real estate, home equity and commercial business loans, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of one- to four-family residential loans. The increase in loan interest income was also due to the receipt of $202,000 of interest income on one non-performing commercial real estate loan which paid off during the year ended December 31, 2017. The payoff of this non-performing commercial loan was the primary factor for the increase in the average yield on the loan portfolio, which increased from 4.64% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 4.74% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield on the loan portfolio would have been 4.68% for the year ended December 31, 2017 if the $202,000 of interest income received on the non-performing loan payoff was excluded.\nInvestment interest income decreased $453,000, or 15.6%, to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of the investment portfolio from $98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $80.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in the average balance of the investment portfolio was primarily due to the Company's strategy to reinvest sale proceeds and paydowns received on the securities portfolio into loan originations, primarily commercial loans. The purpose of this strategy was to shorten the duration of interest earning assets in order to be in a better position to take advantage of future increases in market interest rates as well as to manage interest rate risk. The average yield on the investment portfolio increased 10 basis points from 2.94% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to paydowns and sales of lower yielding securities.\nOther interest income increased by $156,000, or 136.8%, to $270,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a 49 basis points increase in the average yield on the interest earning deposits and federal funds sold portfolio. The average yield increased from 0.36% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 0.85% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in average yield was primarily due to a 75 basis points increase in the fed funds rate since December 31, 2016. The average balance of the interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold portfolio decreased by $178,000, or 0.6%, from $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $2.6 million, an increase of $336,000, or 14.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest paid on deposits increased by $250,000, or 13.7%, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense was impacted by a four, 13 and eight basis points increase, respectively, in the average interest rates paid on demand deposit, money market and time deposit accounts, as well as a $19.3 million increase in average core deposits since the year ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in average time deposits during the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCompany's continued strategic focus on growing low-cost core deposits. The average balance of deposits for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $338.7 million with an average rate of 0.61% compared to the average balance of deposits of $322.5 million and an average rate of 0.57% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The interest expense related to advances from the FHLBNY increased $95,000, or 25.5%, to $468,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of increases in the average balance and average rate of FHLBNY advances. The average balance of advances from the FHLBNY for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $23.1 million with an average rate of 2.03% compared to an average balance of FHLBNY advances of $19.3 million and an average rate of 1.94% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the average balance was due to additional borrowings that allowed the Bank to take advantage of the low fixed-rates in order to fund loan growth.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A $510,000 provision to the allowance for loan losses was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a $615,000, or 54.7%, decrease as compared to the provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in provision expense was primarily due to a decrease in provision set aside for impaired loans during 2017, as well as an improvement in the non-performing loan ratios during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nThe $510,000 provision recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of the following:\n\ufeff\nTable 110: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$217,000 provision on commercial business loans, primarily due to a $7.2 million, or 35.0%, increase in the commercial business loan portfolio since December 31, 2016, to reflect inherent losses on new loan originations.

Non-interest income decreased by $1.4 million, or 34.8%, from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.6 million pre-tax realized gain on the sale of securities during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a $244,000 pre-tax realized gain on the sale of securities during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was also due to a $107,000, or 88.4%, decrease in gains on sales of loans during the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of a fourth quarter 2016 strategic decision to generally retain, rather than sell, all residential loans that we originate due to the stabilization of the Bank's interest rate risk levels. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance which increased $77,000, or 27.4%, primarily due to the purchase of an additional $2.5 million in bank owned life insurance in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\ufeff\nNon-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses increased by $481,000, or 3.5%, from $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $380,000, or 5.2%, primarily due to annual salary increases and grants of stock awards, partially offset by lower health insurance costs and supplemental retirement benefit plan expenses. Data processing costs increased by $138,000, or 12.3%, primarily due to implementation of internet and mobile technology associated with expanded product features and growth in deposit and loan accounts. Other expenses increased $91,000, or 7.4%, primarily due to an increase in donations, expenses related to loan originations and collection and foreclosure expenses. Advertising expenses increased $60,000, or 11.2%, primarily due to additional marketing campaigns during 2017. The increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year was partially offset by a $127,000, or 12.7%, decrease in professional services for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016, due to lower consulting and legal costs. FDIC insurance assessments decreased $49,000, or 24.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 due to changes during the fourth quarter of 2016 in how the FDIC assesses insurance costs which is more favorable to smaller community banks.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense increased by $410,000, or 52.9%, from $775,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the recognition of a $262,000 net income tax expense for the revaluation of net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate enacted under the Tax Act. The Tax Act lowered the corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% for the Company's tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Tax Act was enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017 and generally accepted accounting principles require that the impact of the provisions in the Tax Act be accounted for in the period of enactment. As such, the Company was required to revalue its net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017, to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate. The increase in income tax expense was also due to higher pre-tax income during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Without the impact of the net deferred tax asset revaluation, the effective tax rate would have increased to 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an effective tax rate of 18.1%\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase would have been primarily a result of a decrease in the mix of tax-exempt income derived from our municipal bond portfolio related to the pre-tax income for 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise during the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to fund loan commitments, to pay the deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers as well as to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposits, fed funds balances, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and securities, maturities and sales of investments and loans, interest earning deposits at other financial institutions and funds provided from operations. We have written agreements with the FHLBNY, which allows us to borrow the maximum lending values designated by the type of collateral pledged. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum amount that we can borrow from the FHLBNY was $107.8 million and was collateralized by a pledge of certain fixed-rate residential, one- to four-family loans. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding advances under this agreement of $24.7 million. We have a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank discount window for overnight borrowings which is collateralized by a pledge of our securities, and allows us to borrow up to the value of the securities pledged, which was equal to a book value of $11.0 million and a fair value of $11.2 million as of December 31, 2018. There were no balances outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank at December 31, 2018. We have also established lines of credits with correspondent banks for $22.0 million, of which $20.0 million is unsecured and the remaining $2.0 million will be secured by a pledge of our securities when a draw is made. There were no borrowings on these lines as of December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit outflows, calls of investment securities, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds.\n\ufeff\nOur primary investing activities include the origination of loans and the purchase of investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we originated loans of approximately $130.6 million as compared to approximately $119.0 million of loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2017. Loan originations exceeded principal repayments and other deductions in 2018 by $30.1 million. Purchases of investment securities totaled $16.2 million and $13.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These activities were funded primarily through deposit growth, principal payments received on loans and securities, borrowings and cash reserves.\n\ufeff\nAs described elsewhere in this report, the Company has loan commitments to borrowers and borrowers have unused overdraft lines of protection, unused home equity lines of credit and unused commercial lines of credit that may require funding at a future date. The Company believes it has sufficient funds to fulfill these commitments, including sources of funds available through the use of FHLBNY advances or other liquidity sources. Total deposits were $432.5 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $405.2 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in total deposits was due to growth in net core deposits and time deposits during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company's strategic focus is on growing lower-cost core deposits among its retail and commercial customers in an effort to manage interest expenses. Time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were $55.2 million at December 31, 2018. Based on our deposit retention experience, current pricing strategy, and competitive pricing policies, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us following their maturity.\n\ufeff\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore, we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. The marginal cost of new funding, however, whether from deposits or borrowings from the FHLBNY, will be carefully considered as we monitor our liquidity needs. Therefore, in order to minimize our cost of funds, we may consider additional borrowings from the FHLBNY in the future.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe do not anticipate any material capital expenditures in 2019. We do not have any balloon or other payments due on any long-term obligations, other than the borrowing agreements noted above.\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet items include loan commitments as described in Note 16 in the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and, as of December 31, 2018, an interest swap agreement for a notional amount of $3.0 million, which is not designated as a hedging instrument and does not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2018, we had loan commitments to borrowers of approximately $41.9 million and overdraft lines of protection, unused home equity lines of credit, and unused commercial lines of credit of approximately $52.4 million. We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\n\ufeff\nAccounting Polices, Standards and Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 in the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies, the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards and recent accounting pronouncements.\n\ufeff", "summary": "The report summarizes the management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations for the year.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nThis discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K, and the other statistical data provided in this Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nImportant Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\ufeff\nCertain statements in this annual report are forward-looking\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may,\u201d will,\u201d expect,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d target,\u201d plan,\u201d project\u201d or continue\u201d or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or similar terminology, and are made on the basis of management's current plans and analyses of our business and the industry in which we operate as a whole. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, competition, interest rate sensitivity and exposure to regulatory and legislative changes, and the other risks and uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d These factors in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our financial performance and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements if future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.\nGeneral Overview of the Company's Activities and Risks\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans and investments and the interest expense we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on these balances.\nOur operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges and fees and gains and losses on the sales of securities and loans, our provision for loan losses and non-interest expenses which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional services, advertising and other general and administrative expenses.\nFinancial institutions like us, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are principally concentrated in the Western New York area, and our operations and earnings are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations are also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact the Company.\nTo operate successfully, we must manage various types of risk, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational and information technology risks, strategic risk, reputation risk and compliance risk. A significant form of market risk for the Company is interest rate risk, as the Company's assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. Net interest income is our primary source of revenue and interest rate risk is a significant non-credit related risk to which our Company is exposed. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of our assets and liabilities. In addition to directly impacting net interest income, changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers and debt issuers to repay loans and debt securities, the volume of loan\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrepayments and refinancings, the flow and mix of deposits and the fair value of available for sale securities. In recent years, the Company has adjusted its strategies to manage interest rate risk by originating a greater volume of shorter-term, adjustable rate commercial real estate and commercial business loans and increasing its concentration of core deposits, which are less interest rate sensitive. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of $3.0 million to convert a portion of its fixed rate residential, one- to four-family real estate loans into adjustable rate interest-earning assets, to better manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.\nCredit risk is also a significant form of risk for the Company. Credit risk is the risk to our earnings and stockholders' equity that results from customers, to whom loans have been made, and from issuers of debt securities in which the Company has invested, failing to repay their obligations. The magnitude of risk depends on the capacity and willingness of borrowers and debt issuers to repay and the sufficiency of the value of collateral obtained to secure the loans made or investments purchased. This risk is managed by policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors, review of compliance with the policies and periodic reporting and evaluation of loans or securities that are non-performing or demonstrate other characteristics of potential loss.\n\ufeff\nManagement Strategy\nOur Reputation. Our primary management strategy has been to maintain our position as an authentic community bank, locally headquartered in Western New York, with over 127 years of service to our community. Our management team strives to accomplish this goal by continuing to emphasize our exceptional individualized customer service and financial strength, continued community involvement, effective risk management, strong capital levels, technological services and penetration in our market areas via organic growth of loans and deposits.\nBranding and Marketing. We currently operate eleven full-service branch offices throughout Western New York, where our branch teams initiate and develop both consumer and commercial customer relationships in and around the surrounding market areas. We offer concierge banking services, together with our online and mobile customer conveniences, creating a truly individualized approach for customers to manage their finances whenever, wherever and however they wish. As a true local bank, we pride ourselves on offering competitive products delivered with the individualized service our customers have come to expect. Our experienced team of commercial bankers can meet the needs of nearly any type of business through a variety of checking and credit products, and banking services. Our team members live and work right here in our Western New York communities and can fully understand the specific challenges and opportunities our customers face daily. As the banking industry continues to evolve to meet the rapidly increasing demands of those we serve, specifically in the area of technological conveniences, we must continually listen keenly to our customers, and remain proactive in our efforts to provide the unparalleled service they have come to expect. From local decision-making, responding quickly and efficiently to customer needs, and utilizing technology to level the playing field with our competitors, we are committed to developing long-term relationships with our customers. Staying true to our local roots and mission of Putting People First\u201d continues to uniquely position us as a bank of choice in Western New York.\nTechnology. An important strategic objective is to continue to evaluate and enhance the technology supporting our customer service. We are committed to making investments in technology and we believe that it represents an efficient way to deploy a portion of our capital. To this end, the Company has developed a five year plan for the implementation of cost effective and efficient digital services to meet our customer's technology needs, to focus on attracting new customers, and to improve our operational efficiencies. Although we remain committed to expanding our retail branch footprint whenever it makes strategic sense, we will be concentrating our near term efforts on expanding our digital footprint.\nOur People. A large part of our success is related to customer service and customer satisfaction. Having employees who understand and value our clientele and their business is a key component to our success. We believe that our present staff is one of our competitive strengths, and thus the retention of such persons and our ability to continue to attract quality personnel is a high priority.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nLending. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio with emphasis on the origination of short-term adjustable rate commercial real estate, commercial business and home equity loans, while maintaining strong underwriting and asset quality. Historically, our lending portfolio has consisted predominantly of residential one- to four-family mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, residential one- to four-family mortgage loans (including loans to finance the construction of one- to four-family homes) constituted 39.5% and 39.6%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio at such respective dates. In the past, we have sold low-yield long-term conforming fixed rate one- to four-family residential loans that we originated on the secondary market, as part of our interest rate risk strategy and asset/liability management, and may do so in the future, if it is deemed appropriate. We typically retain servicing rights when we sell one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.\nDue to the interest rate risk inherent in holding long-term, fixed rate one- to four-family real estate loans in our portfolio, we have been strategically focused on increasing the originations of commercial real estate loans to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of developed real estate. We have also focused on commercial business lending to small businesses, including business installment loans, lines of credit and other commercial loans. These types of commercial loans are generally made at higher interest rates and for shorter terms than one- to four-family real estate loans, which reduces the Bank's interest rate risk. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our commercial real estate loan portfolio (including loans to finance the construction of commercial real estate) represented the largest holdings in our loan portfolio at 44.0% and 42.0%, respectively, of total loans.\n\ufeff\nCommercial business loans, home equity loans and consumer loans provide diversification to our loan portfolio while meeting the needs of our customers. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our commercial business loan portfolio represented 5.6% and 7.6%, respectively, of total loans, while the home equity loan portfolio represented 10.7% and 10.4%, of total loans, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAsset Quality. We remain committed to maintaining prudent underwriting standards and aggressively monitoring our loan portfolio to maintain asset quality. We introduce loan products only when we are confident that our staff has the necessary expertise to originate and administer such loans, and that sound underwriting and collection procedures are in place. Our goal is to continue to improve our asset quality through prudent underwriting standards and the diligence of our loan collection personnel. At December 31, 2018, our ratio of non-performing loans to total net loans was 0.82% as compared to 1.05% at December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nInvestment Portfolio. Our investment policy is designed primarily to complement our lending and deposit activities and to provide and maintain liquidity within established guidelines, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. We employ a third party financial advisor to assist us in managing our investment portfolio and developing balance sheet strategies.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $86.2 million and $80.4 million, respectively, invested in securities available for sale, the majority of which are agency collateralized mortgage obligation securities ( CMOs\u201d), agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. At December 31, 2018, we had a $165,000, net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio as compared to a $1.2 million net unrealized gain as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in the net unrealized gain during 2018 was due to an increase in market interest rates, which had a negative impact on the market value of our securities portfolio as demand increased for new-issue securities with higher rates.\nAsset Liability Management. As mentioned earlier in this report, our business consists primarily of originating commercial real estate loans and one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by properties in our market area and investing in residential mortgage backed securities, CMOs and municipal securities. One- to four-family residential real estate loans generally involve a lower degree of credit risk and carry a lower yield than commercial real estate and commercial business loans. The average maturity of residential real estate loans is longer than that for commercial loans. Our loans are primarily funded by core deposits (i.e. checking, savings and money market accounts) and time deposits (which typically mature within 2 to 3 years on average). As a\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nresult, we are exposed to interest rate risk, as our interest-bearing liabilities will mature or re-price more quickly than our interest-earning assets in a rising rate environment. A key part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The Asset and Liability Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk and the Asset and Liability Committee meets at least quarterly to review the interest rate risk position.\nAlthough we plan to continue to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans going forward, we have been and intend to continue to increase our focus on the origination of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans. Commercial loans generally have adjustable rates, higher returns and shorter durations than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, thereby reducing interest rate risk levels. As part of our asset liability strategy, we review the duration of assets on our balance sheet, and if necessary, we may sell loans or securities to help manage our interest rate risk.\nOur strategy also involves managing interest expense. In recent years, we have decreased the amount of higher-cost fixed rate time deposits and have concentrated on building lower-cost core deposits. We offer competitive rates on a variety of deposit products to meet the needs of our customers and to meet asset-liability goals. We also consider borrowed funds or brokered deposits to supplement our deposit portfolio or liquidity requirements, as needed.\nWe are actively involved in managing our balance sheet through the direction of our Asset-Liability Committee and the assistance of a third party advisor. Historic economic conditions have underscored the importance of a strong balance sheet. We strive to achieve this through managing our interest rate risk and maintaining strong capital levels, putting aside adequate loan loss reserves and keeping liquid assets on hand. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of $3.0 million to convert a portion of its fixed rate residential, one- to four-family real estate loans into adjustable rate interest-earning assets, to better manage its exposure to movements in interest rates. In addition to the interest rate swap arrangement, we have diversified our asset mix during the last three years, which may result in improved net interest margins and reduced exposure of our net interest income and earnings to interest rate risk. We will continue to manage our interest rate risk by diversifying the type and maturity of assets in our loan and investment portfolios and monitoring the maturities in our deposit portfolio and borrowing facilities.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIt is management's opinion that accounting estimates covering certain aspects of our business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity required in making such estimates.\n\ufeff\nAllowance for loan losses. Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses required for probable credit losses and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations. Management's monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance considers our historical loan loss experience, review of specific loans that are past due or where management has knowledge of possible credit problems, current economic conditions, and such other factors considered appropriate to estimate loan losses. Management uses presently available information to estimate probable losses on loans; however, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in estimates, assumptions, or economic conditions. Significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions in our local market areas, concentrations of risk or a decline in local property values. The Company's determination as to the amount of its allowance for loan losses is subject to review by its bank regulators, which can require the establishment of additional loss allowances. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the allowance for loan losses.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nInvestment Valuations. In management's opinion, the accounting policy relating to the valuation of investments is a critical accounting policy. We use a third party vendor to provide independent pricing of the securities in our investment portfolio. The third party vendor utilizes public quotations, third party dealer quotes and pricing models. The determination of fair value pricing on investments may require significant judgment or estimation, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the item being valued. The use of different assumptions for these valuations could produce significantly different results which may have material positive or negative effects on the results of our operations. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on fair value.\nImpairment of Investments. Management also considers the accounting policy relating to the impairment of investments to be a critical accounting policy due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the material effect an impairment loss could have on the consolidated results of income. The credit portion of a decline in the fair market value of investments below cost deemed to be other-than-temporary ( OTTI\u201d) may be charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for an asset. Management continually reviews the current value of its investments for evidence of OTTI. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on OTTI.\nThese critical policies and their application are reviewed periodically by our Audit/Risk Committee and our Board of Directors. All accounting policies are important, and as such, we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in the notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements to better understand how our financial performance is reported.\n\ufeff\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as commercial and residential mortgage loans and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on them.\n\ufeff\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields. The following table sets forth certain information relating to our average balance sheets and reflects the average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the years indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the years indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for loan losses, but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nyields. Interest income on securities does not include a tax equivalent adjustment for bank qualified municipal bonds.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n (1) The tax equivalent adjustment for bank qualified municipal securities results in rates of 3.63%, 4.09% and 3.88% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRate Volume Analysis. The following table analyzes the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table shows the amount of the change in interest income or expense caused by either changes in outstanding balances (volume) or changes in interest rates. The effect of a change in volume is measured by applying the average rate during the first year to the volume change between the two years. The effect of changes in rate is measured by applying the change in rate between the two years to the average volume during the first year. Changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the absolute value of the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\n\ufeff\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nThis discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K, and the other statistical data provided in this Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nImportant Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\ufeff\nCertain statements in this annual report are forward-looking\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may,\u201d will,\u201d expect,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d target,\u201d plan,\u201d project\u201d or continue\u201d or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or similar terminology, and are made on the basis of management's current plans and analyses of our business and the industry in which we operate as a whole. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, competition, interest rate sensitivity and exposure to regulatory and legislative changes, and the other risks and uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.\u201d These factors in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our financial performance and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements if future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.\nGeneral Overview of the Company's Activities and Risks\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans and investments and the interest expense we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on these balances.\nOur operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges and fees and gains and losses on the sales of securities and loans, our provision for loan losses and non-interest expenses which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional services, advertising and other general and administrative expenses.\nFinancial institutions like us, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are principally concentrated in the Western New York area, and our operations and earnings are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations are also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact the Company.\nTo operate successfully, we must manage various types of risk, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational and information technology risks, strategic risk, reputation risk and compliance risk. A significant form of market risk for the Company is interest rate risk, as the Company's assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. Net interest income is our primary source of revenue and interest rate risk is a significant non-credit related risk to which our Company is exposed. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of our assets and liabilities. In addition to directly impacting net interest income, changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers and debt issuers to repay loans and debt securities, the volume of loan\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrepayments and refinancings, the flow and mix of deposits and the fair value of available for sale securities. In recent years, the Company has adjusted its strategies to manage interest rate risk by originating a greater volume of shorter-term, adjustable rate commercial real estate and commercial business loans and increasing its concentration of core deposits, which are less interest rate sensitive. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of $3.0 million to convert a portion of its fixed rate residential, one- to four-family real estate loans into adjustable rate interest-earning assets, to better manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.\nCredit risk is also a significant form of risk for the Company. Credit risk is the risk to our earnings and stockholders' equity that results from customers, to whom loans have been made, and from issuers of debt securities in which the Company has invested, failing to repay their obligations. The magnitude of risk depends on the capacity and willingness of borrowers and debt issuers to repay and the sufficiency of the value of collateral obtained to secure the loans made or investments purchased. This risk is managed by policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors, review of compliance with the policies and periodic reporting and evaluation of loans or securities that are non-performing or demonstrate other characteristics of potential loss.\n\ufeff\nManagement Strategy\nOur Reputation. Our primary management strategy has been to maintain our position as an authentic community bank, locally headquartered in Western New York, with over 127 years of service to our community. Our management team strives to accomplish this goal by continuing to emphasize our exceptional individualized customer service and financial strength, continued community involvement, effective risk management, strong capital levels, technological services and penetration in our market areas via organic growth of loans and deposits.\nBranding and Marketing. We currently operate eleven full-service branch offices throughout Western New York, where our branch teams initiate and develop both consumer and commercial customer relationships in and around the surrounding market areas. We offer concierge banking services, together with our online and mobile customer conveniences, creating a truly individualized approach for customers to manage their finances whenever, wherever and however they wish. As a true local bank, we pride ourselves on offering competitive products delivered with the individualized service our customers have come to expect. Our experienced team of commercial bankers can meet the needs of nearly any type of business through a variety of checking and credit products, and banking services. Our team members live and work right here in our Western New York communities and can fully understand the specific challenges and opportunities our customers face daily. As the banking industry continues to evolve to meet the rapidly increasing demands of those we serve, specifically in the area of technological conveniences, we must continually listen keenly to our customers, and remain proactive in our efforts to provide the unparalleled service they have come to expect. From local decision-making, responding quickly and efficiently to customer needs, and utilizing technology to level the playing field with our competitors, we are committed to developing long-term relationships with our customers. Staying true to our local roots and mission of Putting People First\u201d continues to uniquely position us as a bank of choice in Western New York.\nTechnology. An important strategic objective is to continue to evaluate and enhance the technology supporting our customer service. We are committed to making investments in technology and we believe that it represents an efficient way to deploy a portion of our capital. To this end, the Company has developed a five year plan for the implementation of cost effective and efficient digital services to meet our customer's technology needs, to focus on attracting new customers, and to improve our operational efficiencies. Although we remain committed to expanding our retail branch footprint whenever it makes strategic sense, we will be concentrating our near term efforts on expanding our digital footprint.\nOur People. A large part of our success is related to customer service and customer satisfaction. Having employees who understand and value our clientele and their business is a key component to our success. We believe that our present staff is one of our competitive strengths, and thus the retention of such persons and our ability to continue to attract quality personnel is a high priority.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nLending. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio with emphasis on the origination of short-term adjustable rate commercial real estate, commercial business and home equity loans, while maintaining strong underwriting and asset quality. Historically, our lending portfolio has consisted predominantly of residential one- to four-family mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, residential one- to four-family mortgage loans (including loans to finance the construction of one- to four-family homes) constituted 39.5% and 39.6%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio at such respective dates. In the past, we have sold low-yield long-term conforming fixed rate one- to four-family residential loans that we originated on the secondary market, as part of our interest rate risk strategy and asset/liability management, and may do so in the future, if it is deemed appropriate. We typically retain servicing rights when we sell one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.\nDue to the interest rate risk inherent in holding long-term, fixed rate one- to four-family real estate loans in our portfolio, we have been strategically focused on increasing the originations of commercial real estate loans to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of developed real estate. We have also focused on commercial business lending to small businesses, including business installment loans, lines of credit and other commercial loans. These types of commercial loans are generally made at higher interest rates and for shorter terms than one- to four-family real estate loans, which reduces the Bank's interest rate risk. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our commercial real estate loan portfolio (including loans to finance the construction of commercial real estate) represented the largest holdings in our loan portfolio at 44.0% and 42.0%, respectively, of total loans.\n\ufeff\nCommercial business loans, home equity loans and consumer loans provide diversification to our loan portfolio while meeting the needs of our customers. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our commercial business loan portfolio represented 5.6% and 7.6%, respectively, of total loans, while the home equity loan portfolio represented 10.7% and 10.4%, of total loans, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAsset Quality. We remain committed to maintaining prudent underwriting standards and aggressively monitoring our loan portfolio to maintain asset quality. We introduce loan products only when we are confident that our staff has the necessary expertise to originate and administer such loans, and that sound underwriting and collection procedures are in place. Our goal is to continue to improve our asset quality through prudent underwriting standards and the diligence of our loan collection personnel. At December 31, 2018, our ratio of non-performing loans to total net loans was 0.82% as compared to 1.05% at December 31, 2017.\n\ufeff\nInvestment Portfolio. Our investment policy is designed primarily to complement our lending and deposit activities and to provide and maintain liquidity within established guidelines, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. We employ a third party financial advisor to assist us in managing our investment portfolio and developing balance sheet strategies.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $86.2 million and $80.4 million, respectively, invested in securities available for sale, the majority of which are agency collateralized mortgage obligation securities ( CMOs\u201d), agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. At December 31, 2018, we had a $165,000, net unrealized gain on the investment portfolio as compared to a $1.2 million net unrealized gain as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in the net unrealized gain during 2018 was due to an increase in market interest rates, which had a negative impact on the market value of our securities portfolio as demand increased for new-issue securities with higher rates.\nAsset Liability Management. As mentioned earlier in this report, our business consists primarily of originating commercial real estate loans and one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by properties in our market area and investing in residential mortgage backed securities, CMOs and municipal securities. One- to four-family residential real estate loans generally involve a lower degree of credit risk and carry a lower yield than commercial real estate and commercial business loans. The average maturity of residential real estate loans is longer than that for commercial loans. Our loans are primarily funded by core deposits (i.e. checking, savings and money market accounts) and time deposits (which typically mature within 2 to 3 years on average). As a\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nresult, we are exposed to interest rate risk, as our interest-bearing liabilities will mature or re-price more quickly than our interest-earning assets in a rising rate environment. A key part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The Asset and Liability Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk and the Asset and Liability Committee meets at least quarterly to review the interest rate risk position.\nAlthough we plan to continue to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans going forward, we have been and intend to continue to increase our focus on the origination of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans. Commercial loans generally have adjustable rates, higher returns and shorter durations than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, thereby reducing interest rate risk levels. As part of our asset liability strategy, we review the duration of assets on our balance sheet, and if necessary, we may sell loans or securities to help manage our interest rate risk.\nOur strategy also involves managing interest expense. In recent years, we have decreased the amount of higher-cost fixed rate time deposits and have concentrated on building lower-cost core deposits. We offer competitive rates on a variety of deposit products to meet the needs of our customers and to meet asset-liability goals. We also consider borrowed funds or brokered deposits to supplement our deposit portfolio or liquidity requirements, as needed.\nWe are actively involved in managing our balance sheet through the direction of our Asset-Liability Committee and the assistance of a third party advisor. Historic economic conditions have underscored the importance of a strong balance sheet. We strive to achieve this through managing our interest rate risk and maintaining strong capital levels, putting aside adequate loan loss reserves and keeping liquid assets on hand. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of $3.0 million to convert a portion of its fixed rate residential, one- to four-family real estate loans into adjustable rate interest-earning assets, to better manage its exposure to movements in interest rates. In addition to the interest rate swap arrangement, we have diversified our asset mix during the last three years, which may result in improved net interest margins and reduced exposure of our net interest income and earnings to interest rate risk. We will continue to manage our interest rate risk by diversifying the type and maturity of assets in our loan and investment portfolios and monitoring the maturities in our deposit portfolio and borrowing facilities.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIt is management's opinion that accounting estimates covering certain aspects of our business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity required in making such estimates.\n\ufeff\nAllowance for loan losses. Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses required for probable credit losses and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations. Management's monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance considers our historical loan loss experience, review of specific loans that are past due or where management has knowledge of possible credit problems, current economic conditions, and such other factors considered appropriate to estimate loan losses. Management uses presently available information to estimate probable losses on loans; however, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in estimates, assumptions, or economic conditions. Significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions in our local market areas, concentrations of risk or a decline in local property values. The Company's determination as to the amount of its allowance for loan losses is subject to review by its bank regulators, which can require the establishment of additional loss allowances. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the allowance for loan losses.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nInvestment Valuations. In management's opinion, the accounting policy relating to the valuation of investments is a critical accounting policy. We use a third party vendor to provide independent pricing of the securities in our investment portfolio. The third party vendor utilizes public quotations, third party dealer quotes and pricing models. The determination of fair value pricing on investments may require significant judgment or estimation, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the item being valued. The use of different assumptions for these valuations could produce significantly different results which may have material positive or negative effects on the results of our operations. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on fair value.\nImpairment of Investments. Management also considers the accounting policy relating to the impairment of investments to be a critical accounting policy due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the material effect an impairment loss could have on the consolidated results of income. The credit portion of a decline in the fair market value of investments below cost deemed to be other-than-temporary ( OTTI\u201d) may be charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for an asset. Management continually reviews the current value of its investments for evidence of OTTI. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on OTTI.\nThese critical policies and their application are reviewed periodically by our Audit/Risk Committee and our Board of Directors. All accounting policies are important, and as such, we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in the notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements to better understand how our financial performance is reported.\n\ufeff\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as commercial and residential mortgage loans and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on them.\n\ufeff\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields. The following table sets forth certain information relating to our average balance sheets and reflects the average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the years indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the years indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for loan losses, but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nyields. Interest income on securities does not include a tax equivalent adjustment for bank qualified municipal bonds.\n\ufeff\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

The following table analyzes the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table shows the amount of the change in interest income or expense caused by either changes in outstanding balances (volume) or changes in interest rates. The effect of a change in volume is measured by applying the average rate during the first year to the volume change between the two years. The effect of changes in rate is measured by applying the change in rate between the two years to the average volume during the first year. Changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the absolute value of the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\n\ufeff\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>
