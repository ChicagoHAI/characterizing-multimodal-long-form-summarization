As further discussed in Item 15 - Note 1, Nature of Business, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the purchases of these assets were accounted for in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations - Related Issues, whereas the assets and liabilities transferred to the Company relate to interests under common control by NRG and, accordingly, were recorded at historical cost. The difference between the cash proceeds and historical value of the net assets was recorded as a distribution to/from NRG and offset to the noncontrolling interest on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with GAAP, the Company prepares its consolidated financial statements to reflect the transfers as if they had taken place from the beginning of the financial statements period, or from the date the entities were under common control (if later than the beginning of the financial statements period).\nAs you read this discussion and analysis, refer to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10-K, which present the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

The Company is sponsored by GIP through GIP's portfolio company, CEG.\nThe Company's environmentally-sound asset portfolio includes over 5,272 MW of wind, solar and natural gas-fired power generation facilities, as well as district energy systems. Nearly all of these assets sell substantially all of their output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2018 based on CAFD. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,385 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 133 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot and/or chilled water, and, in some instances, electricity to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.\nSignificant Events\nPacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. Certain subsidiaries of the Company, which hold interests in 6 solar facilities totaling 480 MW and Marsh Landing with capacity of 720 MW, sell the output of their facilities to PG&E under long-term PPAs. The Company consolidates three of the solar facilities and Marsh Landing, and records its interest in the other solar facilities as equity method investments. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $1.5 billion of property, plant and equipment, net, $352 million investments in unconsolidated affiliates and $1.4 billion of long - term debt related to these facilities. The related subsidiaries of the Company have entered into financing agreements consisting of non-recourse project level debt and, in certain cases, non-recourse holding company debt. The PG&E bankruptcy filing has triggered defaults under the PPAs with PG&E and such related financing agreements. The Company is currently negotiating forbearance agreements with the lenders for each respective financing arrangement. The Company continues to assess the potential future impacts of the PG&E bankruptcy filing as events occur, however, no impact to the Company's immediate operating activities has occurred as of December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Distribution Reduction\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On February 12, 2019, and as a result of impacts related to the PG&E Bankruptcy, Clearway, Inc.'s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on Class A and Class C common stock of $0.20 per share payable on March 15, 2019, to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2019.

December 31, 2018 and 2017\nGross Margin\nThe Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nIn addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company' presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue, plus other revenues, less cost of fuels. Economic gross margin excludes the following components from GAAP gross margin: contract amortization, mark-to-market results, emissions credit amortization and (losses) gains on economic hedging activities. Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.\nThe below tables present the composition of gross margin, as well as the reconciliation to

estimated cash flows in connection with the preparation and review of the Company's annual budget, it was determined that both Elbow Creek and Forward projects were impaired due to the continued declining merchant power prices in the post contract periods. As a result, the Company recorded impairment losses of $26 million and $5 million for the Elbow Creek and Forward projects, respectively.\nIn addition, in connection with the sale of the November 2017 Drop Down Assets, it was identified that undiscounted cash flows were lower than the book value of certain SPP funds and NRG recorded an impairment expense of $13 million. In accordance with the guidance for transfer of assets under common control, the impairment is reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nFor further discussion see Item 15 - Note 9, Asset Impairments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this Item 7.\nAcquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflect fees paid to advisors and other costs associated with the GIP Transaction, as well as fees paid in connection with the acquisitions that took place in 2018, as further described in Note 3, Business Acquisitions.\nDevelopment Costs\nThe Company incurred $3 million of development cost expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. A total of $2 million of it was for the business development, personnel and benefits costs related to development projects within the Company's Thermal segment.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to income allocated to the Company in DGPV Holdco 3, which was formed in September 2017, partially offset by losses allocated to the company in RPV Holdco and the Utah Solar Portfolio. The HLBV method of accounting generally allocates more losses to the tax equity investors in the first several years after fund formation, and conversely, more income to the Company\nInterest

2017 and 2016\nGross Margin\nThe Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nIn addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company' presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue, plus other revenues, less cost of fuels. Economic gross margin excludes the following components from GAAP gross margin: contract amortization, mark-to-market results, emissions credit amortization and (losses) gains on economic hedging activities. Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.\nThe following tables present the composition of gross margin, as well as the reconciliation to economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The Company recorded impairment losses of $117 million, $60 million and $6 million for Elbow Creek, Goat Wind, and Forward, respectively. The other impairments of $2 million related to the projects that were part of the November 2017 Drop Down Assets. Since the acquisition by the Company of the November 2017 Drop Down Assets related to transfer of assets under common control, these impairments were reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period ending December 31, 2016. For further discussion see Item 15 - Note 9, Asset Impairments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this Item 7.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher earnings from the solar partnerships with NRG, as well as the acquisition of the Utah Solar Portfolio in November 2016, partially offset by lower earnings from the San Juan Mesa investment.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $22 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, due to:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumption of the Utah Solar Portfolio debt in connection with the March 2017 Drop Down Assets, as well as debt assumed in connection with the Buckthorn Solar Drop Down Asset on March 30, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance of 2026 Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2016\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance of new project level debt in the second half of 2016 and 2017 partially offset by the lower principal balances on project level debt in 2017\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher borrowings in 2016 on the revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a loss of $75 million attributable to noncontrolling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a loss of $111 million attributable to noncontrolling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method, which was primarily related to the impairment losses described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's principal liquidity requirements are to meet its financial commitments, finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions from time to time, service debt and pay distributions. As a normal part of the Company's business, depending on market conditions, the Company will from time to time consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance its indebtedness. Changes in the Company's operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause the Company to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions.\nCurrent Liquidity Position\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's liquidity was approximately $1,037 million and $680 million, respectively, comprised of cash, restricted cash, and availability under the Company's revolving credit facility.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clearway Energy LLC, excluding subsidiaries\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subsidiaries\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating accounts\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves, including debt service, distributions, performance obligations and other reserves\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility availability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>680\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's liquidity includes $176 million and $168 million of restricted cash balances as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Restricted cash consists primarily of funds to satisfy the requirements of certain debt arrangements and funds held within the Company's projects that are restricted in their use. As of December 31, 2018, these restricted funds comprised of $84 million designated to fund operating expenses, approximately $26 million designated for current debt service payments, and $32 million restricted for reserves including debt service, performance obligations and other reserves, as well as capital expenditures. The remaining $34 million is held in distribution reserve accounts, of which $31 million related to subsidiaries affected by the PG&E bankruptcy as discussed further below and may not be distributed during the pendency of the bankruptcy.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $41 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, the Clearway Energy, Inc. repaid the remaining $220 million balance of the 2019 Convertible Notes. which was funded through the payment of the remaining balance of the intercompany note due 2019 between Clearway Energy Operating LLC and Clearway Energy, Inc., and acquired the Class A interest in Wind TE Holdco for $19 million, as further described below in Uses of Liquidity.\nIn August 2018 and January 2019, the Company completed a series of open market repurchases of 2019 Convertible Notes in aggregate principal amount of $66 million. The 2019 Convertible Notes matured on February 1, 2019 and the Company paid off the remaining balance of an aggregate principal amount of $170 million as further described in Item 15 - Note 10, Long-term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The PG&E bankruptcy had no effect on availability under the Company's revolving credit facility. However, the Company has non-recourse project-level debt related to each of its subsidiaries that sell their output to PG&E under long-term PPAs. The PG&E bankruptcy filing is an event of default under the related financing agreements which caused uncertainty around the timing of when certain project-level cash distributions will be available to the Company. As of December 31, 2018, all project level cash balances for these subsidiaries were classified as restricted cash.\nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity position, cash flows from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet the Company's financial commitments; debt service obligations; growth, operating and maintenance capital expenditures; and to fund distributions to Clearway Energy, Inc. and Clearway Energy Group, LLC. Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit rating agencies rate a firm's public debt securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firm's credit risk. Ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the market the Company's ability to pay principal, interest and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firm's industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firm's credit risk. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's 2024 Senior Notes, 2025 Senior Notes and 2026 Senior Notes are rated BB by S&P and Ba2 by Moody's.\nS&P and Moody's reaffirmed the ratings outlook as stable on February 25, 2019 and on February 15, 2019, respectively.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under new and existing financing arrangements and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities by Clearway Energy, Inc. or the Company as appropriate given market conditions.

The project sells power under a 25-year PPA to the City of Georgetown, Texas which commenced in July 2018.\nCarlsbad Project - On February 6, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with NRG to purchase 100% of the membership interests in Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC, which indirectly owns the Carlsbad project, a 527 MW natural gas fired project in Carlsbad, CA, pursuant to the NRG ROFO Agreement. Following the COD of the project in December 2018, the Company elected to utilize the Carlsbad backstop facility provided by GIP; as such, GIP purchased 100% of the membership interest in Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC on February 27, 2019. The purchase price for the transaction was $387 million in cash consideration, exclusive of working capital and other adjustments, as well as the assumption of non-recourse debt of $601 million at completion. The Company maintains the option to purchase Carlsbad from GIP at any time within 18 months after February 27, 2019 at the same economic terms at which it originally agreed to purchase the asset from NRG. Should the Company not acquire Carlsbad during such 18 months, the project will become a CEG ROFO Asset.\nHawaii Solar Assets - On August 31, 2018, the Company entered into a binding agreement with CEG to acquire 80 MW of utility-scale solar projects located in Kawailoa and Oahu, Hawaii for cash consideration of $28 million, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments, as well as the assumption of non-recourse debt of $169 million.

The Company incurred approximately $7 million in construction work in progress costs and anticipates the project to total $11 million in capital expenditures. The project is expected to commence commercial operations in the second quarter of 2019.\nInvestment Partnership with CEG\nDuring the period of January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, the Company invested $34 million in distributed generation partnerships with CEG.\nOpen Market Repurchases and Tender Offer\nIn August 2018, Clearway Energy, Inc. repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $16 million of the 2019 Convertible Notes in open market transactions. The repurchases were funded through a repayment of the intercompany note between Clearway Operating LLC and Clearway Energy, Inc. which was reduced by $16 million.\nOn September 10, 2018, pursuant to the 2019 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes indentures, Clearway Energy, Inc. delivered to the holders of the Convertible Notes a fundamental change notice and offer to repurchase any and all of the 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible\nNotes plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The tender offer expired on October 9, 2018. An aggregate principal amount of $109 million of the 2019 Convertible Notes and $243 million of the 2020 Convertible Notes were tendered on or prior to the expiration date and accepted by Clearway Energy, Inc. for purchase. After the expiration of the tender offer, $220 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Convertible Notes and $45 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, Clearway Energy, Inc. repaid the remaining balance of the 2019 Convertible Notes, which was funded through the payment of the remaining balance of the intercompany note due 2019 between Clearway Energy Operating LLC and Clearway Energy, Inc..\nCash Distributions to Clearway Energy, Inc. and CEG\nThe Company intends to distribute to its unit holders in the form of a quarterly distribution all of the CAFD that is generated each quarter less reserves for the prudent conduct of the business, including among others, maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of the assets. CAFD is defined as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, plus cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, cash receipts from notes receivable, less cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, maintenance capital expenditures, pro-rata EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates, cash interest paid, income taxes paid, principal amortization of indebtedness and changes in prepaid and accrued capacity payments. Distributions on units are subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations. The Company expects that, based on current circumstances, comparable distributions will continue to be paid in the foreseeable future. The Company will continue to evaluate its capital allocation approach during the pendency of the PG&E Bankruptcy.\nThe following table lists the distributions paid on the Company's Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D units during the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

DGPV Holdco 1 LLC, DGPV Holdco 2 LLC, DGPV Holdco 3 LLC, RPV Holdco 1 LLC and GenConn are variable interest entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $878 million as of December 31, 2018. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to the Company.

In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements.\nThe tables below disclose the activities of non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2018, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2018.

As discussed below in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk -Commodity Price Risk, NRG, on behalf of the Company, measures the sensitivity of the portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the net open position.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies has not changed.\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. Actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company's critical accounting policies include impairment of long lived assets and other intangible assets.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting Policy\n</td> <td>Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Long Lived Assets\n</td> <td>Recoverability of investments through future operations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory and political environments and requirements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated useful lives of assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Operational limitations and environmental obligations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of future cash flows\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of fair value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Judgment about triggering events\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEvaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other-Than-Temporary Decline in Value\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, or ASC 360, property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adverse business climate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Current-period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The fair value may be determined by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the Company as appropriate. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows or comparable values determined by transactions in the market. The Company uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.\nAnnually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power prices, including the Company's fundamental view for long-term power prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget.\nThe Company recorded certain long-lived asset impairments in 2017 and 2016, as described in Item 15 - Note 9, Asset Impairments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with respect to several wind projects.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, as the Company updated its estimated cash flows in connection with the preparation and review of the Company's annual budget, the Company determined that the cash flows for the Elbow Creek and Forward facilities were below the carrying value of the related assets, primarily driven by continued declining merchant power prices in post-contract periods, and that the assets were considered impaired. The fair value of the facilities was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for each respective plant. The income approach utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows, which include key inputs, such as forecasted power prices, operations and maintenance expense, and discount rates. The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets and recorded impairment losses of $26 million and $5 million for Elbow Creek and Forward, respectively.\nThe Company is also required to evaluate its equity method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether the value is considered to be an other-than-temporary decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360. Similarly, the estimates that the Company makes with respect to its equity method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, the Company would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value under ASC 323.\nCertain of the Company's projects have useful lives that extend well beyond the contract period and therefore, management's view of long-term power prices in the post-contract periods may have a significant impact on the expected future cash flows for these projects. Accordingly, if management's view of long-term power prices in certain markets continues to decrease, it is possible that some of the Company's other long-lived assets may be impaired.\nAs previously described, on January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Certain subsidiaries of the Company sell the output of their facilities to PG&E under long-term PPAs, including interests in 6 solar facilities totaling 480 MW and Marsh Landing with capacity of 720 MW. The Company consolidates three of the solar facilities and Marsh Landing and records its interest in the other solar facilities as equity method investments. The Company has determined that it has no impairment of the long-lived assets or equity method investments associated with these subsidiaries. Assumptions utilized to test these assets for impairment may change based on future events related to the PG&E bankruptcy, which could result in an impairment loss if the PPAs are rejected or amended, or if the Company is not able to collect its revenues from PG&E in a timely manner.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Item 15 - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments.", "summary": "The report provides an analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, with specific focus on the recent acquisition and drop down asset transactions, as well as regulatory and environmental matters.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations\nThe following discussion analyzes the Company's historical financial condition and results of operations, which have been recast to include the Buckthorn Solar Drop Down Asset, as if the transfer had taken place at the beginning of the common control, which was November 9, 2016. As further discussed in Item 15 - Note 1, Nature of Business, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the purchases of these assets were accounted for in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations - Related Issues, whereas the assets and liabilities transferred to the Company relate to interests under common control by NRG and, accordingly, were recorded at historical cost. The difference between the cash proceeds and historical value of the net assets was recorded as a distribution to/from NRG and offset to the noncontrolling interest on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with GAAP, the Company prepares its consolidated financial statements to reflect the transfers as if they had taken place from the beginning of the financial statements period, or from the date the entities were under common control (if later than the beginning of the financial statements period).\nAs you read this discussion and analysis, refer to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10-K, which present the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Also refer to Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors, which include detailed discussions of various items impacting the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe discussion and analysis below has been organized as follows:\n \u2022 Executive Summary, including a description of the business and significant events that are important to understanding the results of operations and financial condition; \n \u2022 Results of operations, including an explanation of significant differences between the periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations; \n \u2022 Financial condition addressing liquidity position, sources and uses of cash, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off-balance sheet arrangements; \n \u2022 Known trends that may affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition in the future; and \n \u2022 Critical accounting policies which are most important to both the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment. \nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction and Overview\nClearway Energy LLC, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Company, is an energy infrastructure investor in and owner of modern, sustainable and long-term contracted assets across North America. The Company is sponsored by GIP through GIP's portfolio company, CEG.\nThe Company's environmentally-sound asset portfolio includes over 5,272 MW of wind, solar and natural gas-fired power generation facilities, as well as district energy systems. Nearly all of these assets sell substantially all of their output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2018 based on CAFD. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,385 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 133 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot and/or chilled water, and, in some instances, electricity to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.\nSignificant Events\nPacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy\n \u2022 On January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. Certain subsidiaries of the Company, which hold interests in 6 solar facilities totaling 480 MW and Marsh Landing with capacity of 720 MW, sell the output of their facilities to PG&E under long-term PPAs. The Company consolidates three of the solar facilities and Marsh Landing, and records its interest in the other solar facilities as equity method investments. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $1.5 billion of property, plant and equipment, net, $352 million investments in unconsolidated affiliates and $1.4 billion of long - term debt related to these facilities. The related subsidiaries of the Company have entered into financing agreements consisting of non-recourse project level debt and, in certain cases, non-recourse holding company debt. The PG&E bankruptcy filing has triggered defaults under the PPAs with PG&E and such related financing agreements. The Company is currently negotiating forbearance agreements with the lenders for each respective financing arrangement. The Company continues to assess the potential future impacts of the PG&E bankruptcy filing as events occur, however, no impact to the Company's immediate operating activities has occurred as of December 31, 2018.  Distribution Reduction\n \u2022 On February 12, 2019, and as a result of impacts related to the PG&E Bankruptcy, Clearway, Inc.'s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on Class A and Class C common stock of $0.20 per share payable on March 15, 2019, to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2019. This dividend is reduced from the last quarterly dividend paid in December 2018 of $0.331 per share. A similar decrease was made to the Company's distributions to unitholders. The Company will continue to assess the level of the distribution pending developments in the PG&E bankruptcy, including the Company's ability to receive unrestricted project distributions. \nForgoing Agua Caliente Drop Down\n \u2022 On November 1, 2018, NRG offered the Company the opportunity to acquire Agua Caliente Borrower 1 LLC, which owns a 35% interest in Agua Caliente, a 290 MW utility-scale solar project located in Dateland, Arizona with PG&E as the project's customer. Pursuant to the terms of the NRG ROFO Agreement, the Company elected to forgo the acquisition. The Company continues to own a 16% interest in the project through Agua Caliente Borrower 2 LLC.  Carlsbad Equity Backstop\n \u2022 On February 6, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with NRG to purchase 100% of the membership interests in Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC, which indirectly owns the Carlsbad project, a 527 MW natural gas fired project in Carlsbad, CA, pursuant to the NRG ROFO Agreement. Following the COD of the project in December 2018, the Company elected to utilize the Carlsbad backstop facility provided by GIP; as such, GIP purchased 100% of the membership interest in Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC on February 27, 2019. The purchase price for the transaction was $387 million in cash consideration, exclusive of working capital and other adjustments, as well as the assumption of non-recourse debt of $601 million at completion. The Company maintains the option to purchase Carlsbad from GIP at any time within 18 months after February 27, 2019 at the same economic terms at which it originally agreed to purchase the asset from NRG. Should the Company not acquire Carlsbad during such 18 months, the project will become a CEG ROFO Asset. \nStrategic Sponsorship with GIP\n \u2022 On August 31, 2018, NRG transferred its full ownership interest in the Company to CEG, the holder of NRG's renewable energy development and operations platform, and subsequently sold 100% of its interest in CEG to an affiliate of GIP. As a result of the GIP Transaction, GIP indirectly acquired a 45.2% economic interest in Clearway Energy LLC and a 55% voting interest in the Company as of August 31, 2018.  Drop Down Asset Acquisitions\n \u2022 On August 31, 2018, the Company entered into a binding agreement with CEG to acquire the effective equity interest in 80 MW of utility-scale solar projects located in Kawailoa and Oahu, Hawaii for approximately $28 million in cash consideration, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments, as well as the assumption of non-recourse debt of $169 million. The transaction is expected to close in summer of 2019. \n \u2022 On March 30, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of NRG's interests in Buckthorn Renewables, LLC, or Buckthorn Solar, which owned a 154 MW utility-scale solar generation project for cash consideration of $42 million, plus assumed non-recourse debt of approximately $132 million as of September 30, 2018. The Buckthorn Solar project sells power under a 25-year power purchase agreement to the City of Georgetown, Texas. On July 1, 2018, the project achieved commercial operation.  Financing and Equity Activities\n \u2022 On April 30, 2018, the Company closed on the refinancing of the revolving credit facility, which extended the maturity of the facility to April 28, 2023 and decreased the Company's overall cost of borrowing. The facility will continue to be used for general corporate purposes including financing of future acquisitions and posting letters of credit. \n \u2022 On September 10, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the 2019 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes indentures, the Company delivered to the holders of the Convertible Notes a fundamental change notice and offer to repurchase any and all of the 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest. An aggregate principal amount of $109 million of the 2019 Convertible Notes and $243 million of the 2020 Convertible Notes were tendered on or prior to the expiration date of October 10, 2018 and accepted by the Company for purchase. After the expiration of the tender offer, $220 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Convertible Notes and $45 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 In August 2018 and January 2019, the Company completed a series of open market repurchases of 2019 Convertible Notes in aggregate principal amount of $66 million. The repurchases were funded through a partial repayment of the intercompany note between Clearway Energy Operating LLC and Clearway Energy, Inc. which was reduced by $66 million. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company paid off the remaining balance of aggregate principal amount of $220 million, which was funded through the payment of the remaining balance of the intercompany note due 2019 between Clearway Energy Operating LLC and Clearway Energy, Inc. \n \u2022 On October 9, 2018, the Company received a notice of conversion with respect to $395,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The Company elected, pursuant to the terms of the 2020 Convertible Notes indenture, to settle the conversion of such 2020 Convertible Notes in Class C common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The conversion of the 2020 Convertible Notes resulted in the issuance by the Company on October 12, 2018 of 14,363 shares of Class C common stock. \n \u2022 On September 27, 2018, Clearway Energy, Inc. issued and sold an additional 3,916,449 shares of Class C common stock for net proceeds of $75 million. The Company utilized the proceeds of the offering to acquire additional 3,916,449 Class C units of Clearway Energy LLC. \n \u2022 On October 1, 2018, Clearway Energy Operating LLC issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes, or the 2025 Senior Notes. The 2025 Senior Notes bear interest at 5.750% and mature on October 15, 2025. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and interest payments will commence on April 15, 2019. The 2025 Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Clearway Energy Operating LLC and are guaranteed by Clearway Energy LLC and by certain of Clearway Energy Operating LLC's wholly owned current and future subsidiaries. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, Clearway Energy, Inc. issued 4,492,473 shares of Class C common stock under the ATM Program for gross proceeds of $79 million and incurred commission fees of $790 thousand, as described in Sources of Liquidity in this Item 7. \nRepowering Partnership\n \u2022 On August 30, 2018, Wind TE Holdco entered into a partnership with CEG in order to facilitate the repowering of the Elbow Creek and Wildorado facilities. As part of the repowering partnership, the Company bought out an existing tax equity partner of Wind TE Holdco for $19 million on January 2, 2019.  Thermal Activities\n \u2022 On June 19, 2018, upon reaching substantial completion, the Company acquired from NRG the UPMC Thermal Project for cash consideration of $84 million, subject to working capital adjustments. The Company had a payable of $4 million to NRG as of December 31,2018, $3 million of which was paid in January 2019 upon final completion of the project pursuant to the EPC agreement. The project adds 73 MWt of thermal equivalent capacity and 7.5 MW of emergency backup electrical capacity to the Company's portfolio. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and is reflected in the Company's Thermal segment. \n \u2022 As further described in Note 10, Long-term Debt, on June 19, 2018, Energy Center Minneapolis LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into an amended and restated Thermal note purchase and private shelf agreement under which it authorized the issuance of the Series E Notes, Series F Notes, Series G Notes, and Series H Notes and established a private shelf facility for the further issuance of $40 million in notes. \n \u2022 On November 1, 2018, the Company entered into an Energy Services Agreement with Mylan LLC to supply chilled water, hot water and electricity through a dedicated combined heat and power facility to be constructed at Mylan's Caguas, Puerto Rico facility. The Company anticipates the project to total $11 million in capital expenditures and is expected to commence commercial operations in the second quarter of 2019.  Environmental Matters and Regulatory Matters\nDetails of environmental matters and regulatory matters are presented in Item 1 - Business, Regulatory Matters and Item 1A - Risk Factors. Details of some of this information relate to costs that may impact the Company's financial results.\nTrends or Matters Affecting Results of Operations and Future Business Performance\nPG&E Bankruptcy\nAs discussed above, the Company continues to assess the potential future impacts of the PG&E bankruptcy filing as events occur. However, no impact to the Company's immediate operating activities has occurred as of December 31, 2018.\nWind and Solar Resource Availability\nThe availability of the wind and solar resources affects the financial performance of the wind and solar facilities, which may impact the Company's overall financial performance. Due to the variable nature of the wind and solar resources, the Company cannot predict the availability of the wind and solar resources and the potential variances from expected performance levels from quarter to quarter. To the extent the wind and solar resources are not available at expected levels, it could have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance for such periods.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table provides selected financial information: \n\n \n(a) Volumes do not include the MWh generated/sold by the Company's equity method investments.\n(b) Volumes generated are not sold as the Conventional facilities sell capacity rather than energy.\n(c) MWh sold do not include 108 and 72 MWh generated by NRG Dover, a subsidiary of the Company, under the PPA with NRG Power Marketing during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, as further described in Item 15 - Note 13, Related Party Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement's discussion of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nGross Margin\nThe Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nIn addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company' presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue, plus other revenues, less cost of fuels. Economic gross margin excludes the following components from GAAP gross margin: contract amortization, mark-to-market results, emissions credit amortization and (losses) gains on economic hedging activities. Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.\nThe below tables present the composition of gross margin, as well as the reconciliation to economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\nGross margin increased by $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to:\n\nOperations and Maintenance Expense\nOperations and maintenance expense decreased by $8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to:\n\nImpairment Losses\nThe Company recorded impairment losses of $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, as the Company updated its estimated cash flows in connection with the preparation and review of the Company's annual budget, it was determined that both Elbow Creek and Forward projects were impaired due to the continued declining merchant power prices in the post contract periods. As a result, the Company recorded impairment losses of $26 million and $5 million for the Elbow Creek and Forward projects, respectively.\nIn addition, in connection with the sale of the November 2017 Drop Down Assets, it was identified that undiscounted cash flows were lower than the book value of certain SPP funds and NRG recorded an impairment expense of $13 million. In accordance with the guidance for transfer of assets under common control, the impairment is reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nFor further discussion see Item 15 - Note 9, Asset Impairments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this Item 7.\nAcquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflect fees paid to advisors and other costs associated with the GIP Transaction, as well as fees paid in connection with the acquisitions that took place in 2018, as further described in Note 3, Business Acquisitions.\nDevelopment Costs\nThe Company incurred $3 million of development cost expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. A total of $2 million of it was for the business development, personnel and benefits costs related to development projects within the Company's Thermal segment.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to income allocated to the Company in DGPV Holdco 3, which was formed in September 2017, partially offset by losses allocated to the company in RPV Holdco and the Utah Solar Portfolio. The HLBV method of accounting generally allocates more losses to the tax equity investors in the first several years after fund formation, and conversely, more income to the Company\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 due to:\n\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had a loss of $1 million attributable to CEG's economic interest in Repowering LLC and a loss of $104 million attributable to noncontrolling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a loss of $75 million attributable to noncontrolling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method, which was primarily related to the impairment losses described above.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table provides selected financial information:\n\n\n \n(a) Volumes do not include the MWh generated/sold by the Company's equity method investments.\n(b) Volumes generated are not sold as the Conventional facilities sell capacity rather than energy.\n(c) MWh sold do not include 72 and 204 MWh generated by NRG Dover, a subsidiary of the Company, under the PPA with NRG Power Marketing during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016,, respectively, as further described in Item 15 - Note 13, Related Party Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations\nThe following discussion analyzes the Company's historical financial condition and results of operations, which have been recast to include the Buckthorn Solar Drop Down Asset, as if the transfer had taken place at the beginning of the common control, which was November 9, 2016. As further discussed in Item 15 - Note 1, Nature of Business, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the purchases of these assets were accounted for in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations - Related Issues, whereas the assets and liabilities transferred to the Company relate to interests under common control by NRG and, accordingly, were recorded at historical cost. The difference between the cash proceeds and historical value of the net assets was recorded as a distribution to/from NRG and offset to the noncontrolling interest on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

The Company will continue to assess the level of the distribution pending developments in the PG&E bankruptcy, including the Company's ability to receive unrestricted project distributions. \nForgoing Agua Caliente Drop Down\n \u2022 On November 1, 2018, NRG offered the Company the opportunity to acquire Agua Caliente Borrower 1 LLC, which owns a 35% interest in Agua Caliente, a 290 MW utility-scale solar project located in Dateland, Arizona with PG&E as the project's customer. Pursuant to the terms of the NRG ROFO Agreement, the Company elected to forgo the acquisition. The Company continues to own a 16% interest in the project through Agua Caliente Borrower 2 LLC.  Carlsbad Equity Backstop\n \u2022 On February 6, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with NRG to purchase 100% of the membership interests in Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC, which indirectly owns the Carlsbad project, a 527 MW natural gas fired project in Carlsbad, CA, pursuant to the NRG ROFO Agreement.

Drop Down Asset Acquisitions\n \u2022 On August 31, 2018, the Company entered into a binding agreement with CEG to acquire the effective equity interest in 80 MW of utility-scale solar projects located in Kawailoa and Oahu, Hawaii for approximately $28 million in cash consideration, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments, as well as the assumption of non-recourse debt of $169 million. The transaction is expected to close in summer of 2019. \n \u2022 On March 30, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of NRG's interests in Buckthorn Renewables, LLC, or Buckthorn Solar, which owned a 154 MW utility-scale solar generation project for cash consideration of $42 million, plus assumed non-recourse debt of approximately $132 million as of September 30, 2018. The Buckthorn Solar project sells power under a 25-year power purchase agreement to the City of Georgetown, Texas. On July 1, 2018, the project achieved commercial operation.  Financing and Equity Activities\n \u2022 On April 30, 2018, the Company closed on the refinancing of the revolving credit facility, which extended the maturity of the facility to April 28, 2023 and decreased the Company's overall cost of borrowing. The facility will continue to be used for general corporate purposes including financing of future acquisitions and posting letters of credit. \n \u2022 On September 10, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the 2019 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes indentures, the Company delivered to the holders of the Convertible Notes a fundamental change notice and offer to repurchase any and all of the 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest. An aggregate principal amount of $109 million of the 2019 Convertible Notes and $243 million of the 2020 Convertible Notes were tendered on or prior to the expiration date of October 10, 2018 and accepted by the Company for purchase. After the expiration of the tender offer, $220 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Convertible Notes and $45 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 In August 2018 and January 2019, the Company completed a series of open market repurchases of 2019 Convertible Notes in aggregate principal amount of $66 million. The repurchases were funded through a partial repayment of the intercompany note between Clearway Energy Operating LLC and Clearway Energy, Inc. which was reduced by $66 million. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company paid off the remaining balance of aggregate principal amount of $220 million, which was funded through the payment of the remaining balance of the intercompany note due 2019 between Clearway Energy Operating LLC and Clearway Energy, Inc. \n \u2022 On October 9, 2018, the Company received a notice of conversion with respect to $395,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The Company elected, pursuant to the terms of the 2020 Convertible Notes indenture, to settle the conversion of such 2020 Convertible Notes in Class C common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The conversion of the 2020 Convertible Notes resulted in the issuance by the Company on October 12, 2018 of 14,363 shares of Class C common stock. \n \u2022 On September 27, 2018, Clearway Energy, Inc. issued and sold an additional 3,916,449 shares of Class C common stock for net proceeds of $75 million. The Company utilized the proceeds of the offering to acquire additional 3,916,449 Class C units of Clearway Energy LLC. \n \u2022 On October 1, 2018, Clearway Energy Operating LLC issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes, or the 2025 Senior Notes. The 2025 Senior Notes bear interest at 5.750% and mature on October 15, 2025. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and interest payments will commence on April 15, 2019. The 2025 Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Clearway Energy Operating LLC and are guaranteed by Clearway Energy LLC and by certain of Clearway Energy Operating LLC's wholly owned current and future subsidiaries. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, Clearway Energy, Inc. issued 4,492,473 shares of Class C common stock under the ATM Program for gross proceeds of $79 million and incurred commission fees of $790 thousand, as described in Sources of Liquidity in this Item 7. \nRepowering Partnership\n \u2022 On August 30, 2018, Wind TE Holdco entered into a partnership with CEG in order to facilitate the repowering of the Elbow Creek and Wildorado facilities. As part of the repowering partnership, the Company bought out an existing tax equity partner of Wind TE Holdco for $19 million on January 2, 2019.  Thermal Activities\n \u2022 On June 19, 2018, upon reaching substantial completion, the Company acquired from NRG the UPMC Thermal Project for cash consideration of $84 million, subject to working capital adjustments. The Company had a payable of $4 million to NRG as of December 31,2018, $3 million of which was paid in January 2019 upon final completion of the project pursuant to the EPC agreement. The project adds 73 MWt of thermal equivalent capacity and 7.5 MW of emergency backup electrical capacity to the Company's portfolio. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and is reflected in the Company's Thermal segment. \n \u2022 As further described in Note 10, Long-term Debt, on June 19, 2018, Energy Center Minneapolis LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into an amended and restated Thermal note purchase and private shelf agreement under which it authorized the issuance of the Series E Notes, Series F Notes, Series G Notes, and Series H Notes and established a private shelf facility for the further issuance of $40 million in notes. \n \u2022 On November 1, 2018, the Company entered into an Energy Services Agreement with Mylan LLC to supply chilled water, hot water and electricity through a dedicated combined heat and power facility to be constructed at Mylan's Caguas, Puerto Rico facility. The Company anticipates the project to total $11 million in capital expenditures and is expected to commence commercial operations in the second quarter of 2019.  Environmental Matters and Regulatory Matters\nDetails of environmental matters and regulatory matters are presented in Item 1 - Business, Regulatory Matters and Item 1A - Risk Factors. Details of some of this information relate to costs that may impact the Company's financial results.\nTrends or Matters Affecting Results of Operations and Future Business Performance\nPG&E Bankruptcy\nAs discussed above, the Company continues to assess the potential future impacts of the PG&E bankruptcy filing as events occur. However, no impact to the Company's immediate operating activities has occurred as of December 31, 2018.\nWind and Solar Resource Availability\nThe availability of the wind and solar resources affects the financial performance of the wind and solar facilities, which may impact the Company's overall financial performance. Due to the variable nature of the wind and solar resources, the Company cannot predict the availability of the wind and solar resources and the potential variances from expected performance levels from quarter to quarter. To the extent the wind and solar resources are not available at expected levels, it could have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance for such periods.\nConsolidated Results of

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement's discussion of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nGross Margin\nThe Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nIn addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company' presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue, plus other revenues, less cost of fuels. Economic gross margin excludes the following components from GAAP gross margin: contract amortization, mark-to-market results, emissions credit amortization and (losses) gains on economic hedging activities. Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.\nThe below tables present the composition of gross margin, as well as the reconciliation to economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</tr>\n</table>\nImpairment Losses\nThe Company recorded impairment losses of $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, as the Company updated its estimated cash flows in connection with the preparation and review of the Company's annual budget, it was determined that both Elbow Creek and Forward projects were impaired due to the continued declining merchant power prices in the post contract periods. As a result, the Company recorded impairment losses of $26 million and $5 million for the Elbow Creek and Forward projects, respectively.\nIn addition, in connection with the sale of the November 2017 Drop Down Assets, it was identified that undiscounted cash flows were lower than the book value of certain SPP funds and NRG recorded an impairment expense of $13 million. In accordance with the guidance for transfer of assets under common control, the impairment is reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nFor further discussion see Item 15 - Note 9, Asset Impairments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this Item 7.\nAcquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflect fees paid to advisors and other costs associated with the GIP Transaction, as well as fees paid in connection with the acquisitions that took place in 2018, as further described in Note 3, Business Acquisitions.\nDevelopment Costs\nThe Company incurred $3 million of development cost expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. A total of $2 million of it was for the business development, personnel and benefits costs related to development projects within the Company's Thermal segment.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to income allocated to the Company in DGPV Holdco 3, which was formed in September 2017, partially offset by losses allocated to the company in RPV Holdco and the Utah Solar Portfolio. The HLBV method of accounting generally allocates more losses to the tax equity investors in the first several years after fund formation, and conversely, more income to the Company\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 due to:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
