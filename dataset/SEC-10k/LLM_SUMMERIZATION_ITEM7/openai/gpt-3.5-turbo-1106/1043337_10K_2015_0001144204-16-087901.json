Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSegments\nWe are primarily organized by products produced and markets served. Under this structure, our operations have been reported using the following segments:\nControl Devices. This segment includes results of operations that manufacture sensors, switches, valves and actuators.\nElectronics. This segment includes results of operations from the production of electronic instrument clusters, electronic control units and driver information systems.\nPST. This segment includes results of operations that design and manufacture electronic vehicle alarms, convenience accessories, vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and in-vehicle audio and video devices.\nWe sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our Wiring business on August 1, 2014. As a result, the Wiring business has been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Company's financial statements herein, and therefore has been excluded from both continuing operations, segment results and other information herein for all periods presented. The Wiring business designed and manufactured wiring harness products and assembled instruments panels for sale principally to the commercial, agricultural and off-highway vehicle markets.\nOverview\nThe Company had income from continuing operations attributable to Stoneridge, Inc. of $23.0 million, or $0.82 per diluted share and a loss from discontinued operations attributable to Stoneridge, Inc. of $(0.2) million, or $(0.01) per diluted share resulting in net income attributable to Stoneridge, Inc. of $22.8 million, or $0.81 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Stoneridge. Inc. in 2015 increased by $60.7 million, or $2.22 per diluted share from loss from continuing operations of $(37.7) million, or $(1.40) per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the 2014 goodwill impairment of $40.2 million (which is net of $11.3 million attributable to noncontrolling interest) related to our PST segment and loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.6 million, which had an aggregate negative impact of $50.8 million, or $1.89 per share attributable to Stoneridge, Inc.\nExcluding the impact of the PST goodwill impairment and loss on debt extinguishment, our income from continuing operations increased during 2015 by $9.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, primarily due to lower interest expense of $10.5 million as a result of the debt refinancing which occurred in the late third and early fourth quarters of 2014. While our gross profit decreased by $13.9 million primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation as well as higher material costs in our Electronics and PST segments, it was substantially offset by a decrease in our selling, general and administrative costs of $13.3 million primarily due to foreign currency translation related to our PST and Electronics segments.\nNet sales in 2015 decreased by $15.8 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to lower sales at our PST segment which were partially offset by higher sales in our Control Devices segment during 2015 compared to 2014. PST segment sales declined primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation while our Control Devices segment sales increased primarily due to higher North American automotive market sales. Electronics segment net sales increased slightly due to sales volume growth which was substantially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nLoss from discontinued operations related to the Wiring business was $(0.2) million, or $(0.01) per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, a $9.2 million, or $0.34 per diluted share decrease from loss from discontinued operations of $(9.4) million, or $(0.35) per diluted share for 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the after-tax loss on disposal of the Wiring business of $8.6 million in 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $54.4 million and $43.0 million, respectively. The increase during 2015 was primarily due to improved working capital and earnings. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had $100.0 million in borrowings outstanding on our $300.0 million Credit Facility.\nOutlook\nWe expect improved financial performance in 2016 compared to 2015 because of new product launches and functional cost improvements.\nWe expect to have significant sales growth in our North American automotive vehicle market in 2016 related to new product launches including our shift by wire product by our Control Devices segment. Also, the North American automotive vehicle market production is expected to increase to 18.2 million units in 2016 (an increase from the 17.5 million units produced in 2015), which we expect to have a favorable effect on our Control Devices segment.\nThe North American commercial vehicle market improved in 2015, but is expected to decline in 2016 while the European commercial vehicle market in 2016 is forecasted to remain at approximately the same level with 2015.\nOur PST segment revenues and operating performance continue to be adversely impacted by weakness of the Brazilian economy and automotive market and was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation. In January 2016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its forecasts for the Brazil gross domestic product to decline 3.5% in 2016 and 0.0% in 2017. Based on the weakness in PST's sales and operating performance during 2015 and lower forecasted growth of the Brazilian economy in 2016, PST's sales and earnings growth expectations continue to be moderated for 2016. As there is significant uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of a recovery in the Brazilian economy and automotive market, PST continues to realign its cost structure to mitigate the effect on earnings of possible continued weakened product demand and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe regularly evaluate the performance of our businesses and their cost structures, including personnel, and make necessary changes thereto in order to optimize our results. We also evaluate the required skill sets of our personnel and periodically make strategic changes. As a consequence of these actions, we incur severance related costs which we refer to as business realignment charges.\nA significant portion of our sales are outside of the United States. These sales are generated by our non-U.S. based operations, and therefore, movements in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on our results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant portion of our raw materials purchased by our Electronics and PST segments are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore movements in foreign currency exchange rates can also have a significant effect on our results of operations. While the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the Swedish krona, euro and Brazilian real in 2015 increasing our material costs and reducing our reported results, we expect that the U.S. dollar will continue to strengthen against these currencies, but at a moderated pace in 2016.\nBecause of the competitive nature of the markets we serve, we face pricing pressures from our customers in the ordinary course of business. In response to these pricing pressures we have been able to effectively manage our production costs by the combination of lowering certain costs and limiting the increase of others, the net impact of which has not been material. However, if we are unable to effectively manage production costs in the future to mitigate future pricing pressures, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nYear Ended December 31,

These were offset by a decrease in agricultural sales volume of $1.0 million.\nOur Electronics segment net sales increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume of our European commercial vehicle products of $16.9 million as well as an increase in sales of our North American commercial vehicle products of $16.6 million (from higher volume related to an increase in post-disposition sales to the Wiring business acquired by Motherson of $15.0 million), which were substantially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation of $28.8 million, or 13.5%, and European commercial vehicle contractual price reductions of $2.4 million.\nOur PST segment net sales decreased primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation which reduced sales by $38.1 million, or 27.3%, and lower product volume. Also, PST's audio/car alarm sales volume declined due to further weakening of the Brazilian economy and automotive market while monitoring service sales volume increased.\nNet sales by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>369,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>330,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>South America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,522 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe and Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,761 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>644,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>660,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,767 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in North American net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales in our North American Control Devices' automotive and Electronics' commercial vehicle markets of $22.8 million and $16.6 million, respectively, which were partially offset by decreased agricultural volume of $1.0 million. The decrease in net sales in South America was primarily due to the impact of an unfavorable foreign currency translation and was also negatively impacted by lower product sales volume as a result of the weakened economic conditions in Brazil. Our decrease in net sales in Europe and Other was primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation, which was substantially offset by increased sales of European commercial vehicle and Chinese automotive market products of $16.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin. Cost of goods sold decreased by 0.4% primarily due to foreign currency translation resulting from changes in exchange rates between the functional currency of our Electronics and PST segments compared to the U.S. dollar. Offsetting the decline from foreign currency translation, cost of goods was negatively impacted by higher material costs resulting from significantly more unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year. Our material cost as a percentage of net sales increased to 51.2% for 2015 compared to 49.2% for 2014. As a result, our gross margin decreased by 1.5% to 27.4% for 2015 compared to 28.9% for 2014. The higher material costs were due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates in our Electronics segment, which were partially offset by lower material costs in our Control Devices segment. The Company purchases the majority of its materials under contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. As such, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Swedish krona, euro and Brazilian real throughout 2015 increased the material costs in our Electronics and PST segments.\nOur Control Devices segment gross margin increased due to increased sales volume, lower material costs, a favorable mix of products sold and product redesign, which were partially offset by higher warranty costs principally related to one product and higher profit sharing.\nOur Electronics segment gross margin decreased primarily due to higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of which was moderated by our foreign currency hedges.\nOur PST segment gross margin remained flat as higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates were offset by a favorable sales mix, prices increases, product redesign, new supplier sourcing and lower business realignment charges. PST business realignment charges decreased to $0.2 million for 2015 from $0.9 million for 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d). SG&A expenses decreased by $13.3 million compared to 2014 as lower costs in our PST and Electronics segments were partially offset by higher costs in our unallocated corporate and Control Devices segments. SG&A costs in our PST and Electronics segments decreased primarily due to foreign currency translation resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A costs in our unallocated corporate segment increased due to higher incentive-based compensation, higher recruitment, business realignment charges of $0.3 million and higher share-based compensation of $2.2 million in connection with the accelerated vesting associated with the retirement of our former President and CEO in June 2015, which were partially offset by lower professional fees. SG&A costs in our Control Devices segment increased primarily due to higher legal fees related to product litigation and an increase in incentive-based compensation. SG&A business realignment charges related to our Electronics, PST and unallocated corporate segments were $0.5 million for 2015 compared to $0.5 million related to PST for 2014.\nDesign and Development ( D&D\u201d). D&D costs decreased by $2.8 million primarily due to foreign currency translation resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates in our PST and Electronics segments which was offset by a slight increase in product development costs in our Control Devices segment. D&D business realignment charges related to our Electronics and PST segments were $0.3 million for 2015 compared to $0.2 million related to PST for 2014.\nGoodwill Impairment. A goodwill impairment of $51.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to our PST segment. The impairment was due to the weakening of both the Brazilian economy and automotive market resulting in lower projected revenue and earnings growth. This non-cash impairment is more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) is summarized in the following table by reportable segment (in thousands):\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Control Devices </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Electronics </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,660 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PST </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,542 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59,587 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unallocated corporate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,117 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,067 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,050 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - not meaningful\nOur Control Devices segment operating income increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume, lower material costs, a favorable mix of products sold and product redesign, which were partially offset by higher warranty, SG&A and D&D costs.\nOur Electronics segment operating income decreased due to a lower gross profit as material costs increased as a result of an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and $0.3 million of business realignment charges incurred in the current year, which were partially offset by lower SG&A and D&D costs resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur PST segment operating performance improved as 2014 results included a goodwill impairment charge of $51.5 million that was recorded in 2014. Excluding the goodwill impairment, PST's operating performance improved by $0.5 million due to lower business realignment charges of $1.2 million, which were $0.4 million and $1.6 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, as price increases, significant material cost reductions achieved from product redesign and new supplier sourcing were more than offset by significantly higher material costs resulting from more unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year.\nOur unallocated corporate operating loss increased primarily due to higher share-based compensation primarily as a result of the acceleration of the vesting associated with the June 2015 retirement of our President and CEO of $2.2 million, higher incentive-based compensation, higher recruitment costs and business realignment charges of $0.3 million during 2015, which were partially offset by lower professional fees.\nOperating income (loss) by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>South America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,542 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59,587 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe and Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(248 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur North American operating results increased due to higher sales in the North American automotive and commercial vehicle markets, lower material costs and a favorable change in product mix, which was substantially offset by higher incentive-based and share-based compensation expense. The improved performance in South America was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $51.5 million taken in 2014. Our results in Europe and Other declined slightly as higher material costs and an unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates related to our Electronics segment were offset by higher sales and gross profit in our China automotive market.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense, net decreased by $10.5 million compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower average debt balance outstanding and a lower weighted-average interest rate. We redeemed our $175.0 million 9.5% senior notes in September and October 2014 using borrowings of $100.0 million on our Credit Facility (which bore annual interest for 2015 of approximately 3.0%), proceeds from the sale of the Wiring business and existing cash.\nEquity in Earnings of Investee. Equity earnings for Minda decreased to $0.6 million in 2015 from $0.8 million in 2014. While sales increased slightly over the prior year, the increase was more than offset by higher operating and financing costs and was negatively impacted by an unfavorable change in foreign currency translation.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The Company recognized debt extinguishment loss of $10.6 million during 2014 due to the redemption of our senior notes and modification of our Credit Facility. The specific components of the debt extinguishment loss are described in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Expense, net. We record certain foreign currency transaction and forward currency hedge contract gains and losses as a component of other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations. Other expense, net increased by $1.3 million to $1.8 million for 2015 from $0.6 million for 2014 due to increased volatility in certain foreign exchange rates in the current period. Also, the unfavorable foreign currency losses in 2014 were partially offset by a gain of $0.4 million on the termination of the interest rate swap.\nIncome Tax Benefit from Continuing Operations. We recognized an income tax benefit of $(0.5) million and $(1.9) million for federal, state and foreign income taxes for 2015 and 2014, respectively. We continue to assert that it is more-likely-than-not that our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets will not be realized, and as such we provide a valuation allowance offsetting those deferred tax assets. The decrease in tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period for 2014 was predominantly due to the impact of recording a valuation allowance against PST's deferred tax assets. The increase in the effective tax rate to (2.7)% in 2015 from (3.5)% in 2014 was primarily due to providing a valuation allowance in 2015 with respect to the deferred tax assets of PST. The impact on the effective rate due to the PST valuation allowance was offset by the impact of the improvement in the performance of our U.S. operations, which do not attract tax due to the full valuation allowance, and the prior year impact of the nondeductible goodwill impairment in 2014 that did not impact the effective tax rate for 2015.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared To Year

This was a result of higher volume including post-disposition sales to the Wiring business acquired by Motherson of $12.2 million and new product sales for 2014 when compared to 2013. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable change in foreign currency translation which reduced sales by approximately $7.0 million, or 4.0%.\nOur PST segment net sales decreased during 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to lower product volume in its OEM, audio and aftermarket channels resulting from weakness in the Brazilian economy and automotive market as well as an unfavorable change in foreign currency translation which reduced sales by approximately $12.7 million, or 7.1%.\nNet sales by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>330,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>301,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>South America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38,752 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe and Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>660,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>659,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in North American net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales volume in our North American commercial vehicle and automotive markets of $18.3 million and $13.6 million, respectively. Our decrease in net sales in South America was primarily due to lower PST product sales volume and the negative impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Our increase in net sales in Europe and Other was primarily due to increased sales of European commercial vehicle market products of $15.6 million, partially offset by an unfavorable change in foreign currency translation.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin. Cost of goods sold increased by 3.6% primarily due to higher material costs. Our material cost as a percentage of net sales increased to 49.2% for 2014 compared to 46.7% for 2013. As a result, our gross margin declined to 28.9% for 2014 compared to 31.2% for 2013. Material costs increased and gross margin declined primarily due to an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and an unfavorable mix of products sold in our Electronics and PST segments.\nOur Control Devices segment gross margin increased slightly due to the benefit of increased sales volume and labor efficiencies.\nOur Electronics segment gross margin declined despite an increase in sales due to higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable change in certain foreign currency exchange rates and an unfavorable change in mix of products sold.\nOur PST segment gross margin declined due to lower sales volume, higher material costs due to an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and an unfavorable change in mix of products sold as well as an increase in labor costs which included $0.9 million in business realignment costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative. SG&A expenses increased by $0.5 million for 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher wages and other employee benefits which included business realignment costs in our PST segment of $0.5 million, and higher performance-based compensation, product liability and intellectual property defense costs, which were partially offset by lower SG&A costs in our PST segment as a result of lower sales commissions, foreign currency translation and the implementation of cost savings measures.\nDesign and Development. D&D costs increased by $1.2 million due to higher product development costs in our Controls Devices segment and lower cost reimbursements in our Electronics segment, which were partially offset by lower product development costs in our PST segment.\nGoodwill Impairment. A goodwill impairment of $51.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to our PST segment. The impairment was due to lower future sales and earnings growth projections resulting from significant weakening of the Brazilian economy and automotive market. This non-cash impairment is more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) is summarized in the following table by reportable segment (in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Control Devices </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Electronics </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,288 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PST </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59,587 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66,798 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unallocated corporate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,067 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,871 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,196 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.7 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(68,226 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(160.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - not meaningful\nOur Control Devices segment operating income increased due to an increase in sales volume and labor efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher design and development, SG&A personnel and product liability defense costs.\nOur Electronics segment operating income decreased despite higher sales due to higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable change in certain foreign exchange rates and an unfavorable change in mix of products sold. Also, operating income decreased as a result of higher design and development, SG&A personnel and intellectual property defense costs.\nOur PST segment operating performance decreased due to a goodwill impairment charge of $51.5 million, lower sales volume, higher material costs due to an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and mix of products sold as well as increased labor costs including business realignment costs of $1.6 million, which were partially offset by lower other sales, general and administrative costs and design and development costs resulting from cost reduction measures implemented.\nUnallocated corporate operating loss increased primarily due to higher performance-based compensation.\nOperating income (loss) by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(88.3 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>South America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59,587 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>230.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66,798 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe and Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,669 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(68,226 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(160.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur North American operating results increased primarily as a result of increased sales in the North American commercial vehicle and automotive markets. The decrease in profitability in South America was primarily due to a PST goodwill impairment charge, lower sales volume, an unfavorable change in mix of products sold, increased labor costs and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Our results in Europe and Other were negatively affected by higher material costs from an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and an unfavorable mix of product sales and higher SG&A expenses substantially all of which related to our Electronics segment.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense, net decreased by $1.2 million, or 6.7% during 2014 when compared to 2013 primarily due to a lower average debt balance outstanding and a lower weighted-average interest rate. We redeemed our $175.0 million 9.5% senior notes in September and October 2014 using borrowings of $100.0 million on our Credit Facility (which bore annual interest of approximately 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014), proceeds from the sale of the Wiring business and existing cash.\nEquity in Earnings of Investee. Equity earnings for Minda increased to $0.8 million from $0.5 million in 2013 primarily due to higher sales, which were partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency translation.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The Company recognized debt extinguishment loss of $10.6 million during 2014 due to the redemption of our senior notes and modification of our Credit Facility. The specific components of the debt extinguishment loss are described in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Expense, net. Other expense, net was $0.6 million for 2014 compared to $1.5 million for 2013. We record certain foreign currency transaction and forward currency hedge contract gains and losses as a component of other expense, net on the consolidated statement of operations. Our results for 2014 and 2013 were unfavorably affected by approximately $1.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, due to the volatility in certain foreign exchange rates. The majority of the unfavorable foreign currency loss for 2014 relates to the currency fluctuation of the Argentinian peso compared to the Brazilian real in our PST segment. The unfavorable foreign currency losses were partially offset by the gain of $0.4 million in 2014 on the termination of our interest rate swap and income of $0.6 million received in 2013 by our PST segment associated with deposits at a financial institution.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit) from Continuing Operations. We recognized income tax expense (benefit) of $(1.9) million and $2.8 million for federal, state and foreign income taxes for 2014 and 2013, respectively. We continue to assert that it is more-likely-than-not that our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets will not be realized, and therefore we provide a valuation allowance offsetting those deferred tax assets. The decrease in tax expense for 2014 compared to 2013 was predominantly due to the tax benefit recognized on the loss incurred by PST, as adjusted for the non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge. The decrease in the tax expense was partially offset by a discrete tax item related to our foreign operations recorded during the current period. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2014 to (3.5)% compared to 2013 of 12.0% was due to the 2014 recognition of a tax benefit on the PST operating loss which was offset by the impact of the non-tax deductible PST goodwill impairment charge and the discrete tax item discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used for): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,990 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,370 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(76,090 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,019 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(82,058 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,039 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,076 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,281 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,804 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,144 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities, which includes cash flows from the Wiring discontinued operations, increased primarily due to lower working capital required as a result of the sale of the Wiring business in August 2014 of $28.5 million and an increase in net income excluding the impacts of the non-cash PST goodwill impairment, loss on extinguishment of debt and the loss on sale of the Wiring business in 2014 of $10.5 million. Our receivable terms and collections rates have remained consistent between periods presented.\nNet cash used for investing activities increased due to higher capital expenditures of $4.0 million primarily to support the launch of new products as well as a repayment of excess proceeds received from Motherson of $1.2 million based on the resolution of the working capital and other adjustments associated with the sale of the Wiring business. Also, $71.4 million in cash was received from the sale of the Wiring business in 2014.\nNet cash used for financing activities decreased primarily due to the fact that in 2015 we had net debt repayments of $8.0 million and repurchases of Common Shares to satisfy tax withholdings of $2.9 million while in 2014 we repurchased $175.0 million of our outstanding senior notes including a redemption premium totaling $183.0 million partially by borrowing $100.0 million on our Credit Facility.\nSummary of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used for): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23,869 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,237 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,957 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(82,058 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(503 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81,555 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,281 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,607 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,804 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38,074 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to higher working capital levels as well as a $6.5 million decrease in net income excluding the impacts of the non-cash PST goodwill impairment and losses on the sale of the Wiring business and early extinguishment of debt. Our receivable terms and collections rates have remained consistent between periods presented.\nThe increase in net cash provided by investing activities for 2014 was due to $71.4 million in cash received from the sale of the Wiring business, which was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in capital expenditures.\nThe increase in net cash used for financing activities for 2014 was due to the redemption of our senior notes including redemption premium totaling $183.0 million, which was partially offset by net borrowings on our Credit Facility and other debt of $100.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively.\nSummary of Future Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments, as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,881 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,184 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement will continue to focus on minimizing its weighted-average cost of capital and believes that cash flows from operations and the availability of funds from our Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our future growth and operating needs.\nAs outlined in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, our Credit Facility permits borrowing up to a maximum level of $300.0 million which includes an accordion feature which allows the Company to increase the availability by up to $80.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. This variable rate facility provides us with lower borrowing rates than the 9.5% senior notes redeemed in 2014 and provides the flexibility to refinance other outstanding debt or finance acquisitions through September 2019. The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain less than a maximum leverage ratio and more than a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for credit arrangements of this type including covenants which place restrictions and/or limitations on the Company's ability to borrow money, make capital expenditures and pay dividends. The Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of $100.0 million at December 31, 2015. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2015. The covenants included in our Credit Facility to date have not and are not expected to limit our financing flexibility.\nPST maintains several short-term obligations and long-term loans used for working capital purposes. At December 31, 2015, there was $18.0 million outstanding on the PST term loans. The PST loans at December 31, 2015 mature as follows: $13.5 million in 2016, $1.9 million in 2017, $1.0 million in 2018 and 2019 and $0.3 million in 2020 and 2021.\nThe Company's wholly owned subsidiary located in Stockholm, Sweden, has an overdraft credit line which allows overdrafts on the subsidiary's bank account up to a maximum level of 20.0 million Swedish krona, or $2.4 million, at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, there were no overdrafts on the bank account.\nAlthough the Company's debt and Credit Facility contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude their use or accelerate the maturity, the Company has not experienced and does not expect these covenants to restrict our financing flexibility. The Company has been and expects to continue to remain in compliance with these covenants during the term of the debt and credit facilities.\nOur future results could also be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. We have significant foreign denominated transaction exposure in certain countries, especially in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Sweden, Estonia and China. We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to certain foreign currency fluctuations. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Our future results could also be unfavorably affected by increased commodity prices as commodity fluctuations impact the cost of our raw material purchases.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $54.4 million, of which $27.9 million was held in the United States and $26.5 million was held in foreign locations. The increase from $43.0 million at December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an improvement in working capital and earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nSeasonality\nOur Control Devices and Electronics segments are not typically materially affected by seasonality, however the demand for our PST segment consumer products is typically higher in the second half of the year, the fourth quarter in particular.\nInflation and International Presence\nGiven the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity prices, we believe that an increase in such items could significantly affect our profitability. Furthermore, by operating internationally, we are affected by foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions of certain countries. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the Company's commodity price and foreign currency exchange rate risks.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are, in the opinion of management, reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions used in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies, those most important to the financial presentation and those that are the most complex, subjective or require significant judgment, are as follows.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Commitments. We recognize revenues from the sale of products, net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on historical authorized returns, at the point of passage of title, which is either at the time of shipment or upon customer receipt based on the terms of the sale. We often enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle's expected production life. Once such agreements are entered into, it is our obligation to fulfill the customers' purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle. These agreements are subject to potential renegotiation from time to time, which may affect product pricing. In certain limited instances, we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products. In such situations, we recognize losses immediately. These agreements generally may also be terminated by our customers at any time.\nOn an ongoing basis, we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers, which include pricing terms. Purchase orders do not always specify quantities. We recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers. In certain instances, we may be asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements. In addition, we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content, the cost of our products and other commercial factors. Such pricing adjustments are recognized as they are negotiated with our customers.\nWarranties. Our warranty liability is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold as of the balance sheet dates. This estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts, combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims. To estimate the warranty liability, we are required to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold. Although we believe that our warranty liability is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. Our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties, which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We have concentrations of sales and trade receivable balances with key customers. Therefore, it is critical that we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer's inability to meet their financial obligations, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. In addition, we review historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts. If economic circumstances change substantially, estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be reduced by a material amount. We do not have collateral requirements with our customers.\nContingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings and claims, including product liability claims, commercial or contractual disputes, environmental enforcement actions and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. We routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses, by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters.\nWe have accrued for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating that amount of probable loss. The liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution.\nInventory Valuation. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the FIFO method for our Electronics and Control Devices segments and average cost method for our PST segment. Where appropriate, standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to approximate actual costs. Estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions, historical sales quantities and patterns and, in some cases, the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories. We adjust our excess and obsolescence reserve at least on a quarterly basis. Excess inventories are quantities of items that exceed anticipated sales or usage for a reasonable period.\nLong-Lived and Finite-Lived Assets. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider important that could trigger our testing of the related asset groups for an impairment include current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses, a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses, significant adverse changes in the business climate within a particular business or current expectations that a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. To test for impairment, the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and disposal of the asset or asset group is compared to its carrying value. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the group of assets that are largely independent of cash flows of other assets. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify projected cash flows. If these undiscounted cash flows are less than their respective carrying values, an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent that the carrying values exceed estimated fair values. The estimation of undiscounted cash flows and fair value requires us to make assumptions regarding future operating results. The results of the impairment testing are dependent on these estimates which require judgment. The occurrence of certain events, including changes in economic and competitive conditions, could impact cash flows eventually realized and management's ability to accurately assess whether an asset is impaired.\nDue to lower actual and forecasted financial results from weakness in the Brazilian economy and automotive market, the Company performed an evaluation of PST's long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014, and concluded that there was no impairment resulting from the decrease in forecasted undiscounted future cash flows.\nShare-Based Compensation. The estimate for our share-based compensation expense involves a number of assumptions. We believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations associated with performance and market based conditions. We estimate volatility and forfeitures based on historical data, future expectations and the expected term of the share-based compensation awards. The assumptions, however, involve inherent uncertainties. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, share-based compensation expense could have varied.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations. Our deferred tax assets include, among other items, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Our U.S. federal net operating losses, if unused, begin to expire in 2026, the state net operating losses expire at various times and the foreign net operating losses expire at various times or have indefinite expiration dates. Our U.S. federal general business credits, if unused, begin to expire in 2021, and the state and foreign tax credits expire at various times.\nAccounting standards require that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. This assessment requires significant judgment, and in making this evaluation, the Company considers available positive and negative evidence, including the potential to carryback net operating losses and credits, the future reversal of certain taxable temporary differences, actual and forecasted results, and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible. Risk factors include U.S. and Brazil economic conditions that affect the U.S. and Brazil automotive and commercial vehicle markets of which the Company has significant operations.\nReversal of a previously recognized valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the reversal is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that we would not realize our U.S. deferred tax assets. As a result we provided a full valuation allowance, net of certain future reversing taxable temporary differences, with respect to our U.S. deferred tax assets. We will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, as a result of the sale of the Wiring business and debt refinancing during the second half of 2014 and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there may be a reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence could develop within the next 12 months that may allow us to reach a conclusion that some or all of the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets will no longer be needed.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that we would not realize our PST segment deferred tax assets. As a result we provided a full valuation allowance, net of certain future reversing taxable temporary differences, with respect to PST's deferred tax assets. We will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on PST's deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of them.\nWe consider the financial reporting basis in excess of tax basis, which includes unremitted earnings, of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for investment in those non-U.S. subsidiaries. Therefore, we have not recorded a deferred tax liability. Specifically with respect to unremitted earnings and the impact of those earnings on the amount of the financial reporting basis in excess of tax basis, if in the future we cannot support that the earnings are indefinitely invested outside the United States, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States (see Note 5).\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2016 - 02, Leases (Topic 842)\u201d, which will require that a lessee recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with a lease term of more than twelve months, with the result being the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability. The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company expects to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements, which will require right of use assets and lease liabilities be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for operating leases.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 - 17, Income Taxes (Topic 740),\u201d which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. Currently entities are required to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the balance sheet on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred income taxes be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. The requirement to apply the jurisdiction by jurisdiction approach will still be required. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within those fiscal years and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 - 16, Business Combinations,\u201d which simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments related to business combinations. ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in the ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years and is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company will adopt this standard as of January 1, 2016, which is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 - 11 Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\u201d which requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market. Replacing the concept of market with the single measurement of net realizable value is intended to reduce cost and complexity. The new accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company expects to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2017, which is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d which is the new comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this principle, an entity identifies the contract with a customer, identifies the separate performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations and recognizes revenue when each separate performance obligation is satisfied. This ASU allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard. As such, the new standard will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which amends the current presentation of certain debt issuance costs in the balance sheet. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, instead of as an asset. The recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The guidance in ASU 2015-03 did not address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance, in June 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,\u201d which states that the SEC will not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to revolving credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing them. These amendments are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for public companies for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. As permitted by the ASU, the Company adopted these standards in the third quarter of 2015, which had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company has elected to continue to present deferred financing costs related to its Credit Facility, which had balances of $1,428 and $1,767 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, within long-term assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSegments\nWe are primarily organized by products produced and markets served. Under this structure, our operations have been reported using the following segments:\nControl Devices. This segment includes results of operations that manufacture sensors, switches, valves and actuators.\nElectronics. This segment includes results of operations from the production of electronic instrument clusters, electronic control units and driver information systems.\nPST. This segment includes results of operations that design and manufacture electronic vehicle alarms, convenience accessories, vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and in-vehicle audio and video devices.\nWe sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our Wiring business on August 1, 2014. As a result, the Wiring business has been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Company's financial statements herein, and therefore has been excluded from both continuing operations, segment results and other information herein for all periods presented. The Wiring business designed and manufactured wiring harness products and assembled instruments panels for sale principally to the commercial, agricultural and off-highway vehicle markets.\nOverview\nThe Company had income from continuing operations attributable to Stoneridge, Inc. of $23.0 million, or $0.82 per diluted share and a loss from discontinued operations attributable to Stoneridge, Inc. of $(0.2) million, or $(0.01) per diluted share resulting in net income attributable to Stoneridge, Inc. of $22.8 million, or $0.81 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Stoneridge. Inc. in 2015 increased by $60.7 million, or $2.22 per diluted share from loss from continuing operations of $(37.7) million, or $(1.40) per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the 2014 goodwill impairment of $40.2 million (which is net of $11.3 million attributable to noncontrolling interest) related to our PST segment and loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.6 million, which had an aggregate negative impact of $50.8 million, or $1.89 per share attributable to Stoneridge, Inc.\nExcluding the impact of the PST goodwill impairment and loss on debt extinguishment, our income from continuing operations increased during 2015 by $9.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, primarily due to lower interest expense of $10.5 million as a result of the debt refinancing which occurred in the late third and early fourth quarters of 2014. While our gross profit decreased by $13.9 million primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation as well as higher material costs in our Electronics and PST segments, it was substantially offset by a decrease in our selling, general and administrative costs of $13.3 million primarily due to foreign currency translation related to our PST and Electronics segments.\nNet sales in 2015 decreased by $15.8 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to lower sales at our PST segment which were partially offset by higher sales in our Control Devices segment during 2015 compared to 2014. PST segment sales declined primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation while our Control Devices segment sales increased primarily due to higher North American automotive market sales. Electronics segment net sales increased slightly due to sales volume growth which was substantially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nLoss from discontinued operations related to the Wiring business was $(0.2) million, or $(0.01) per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, a $9.2 million, or $0.34 per diluted share decrease from loss from discontinued operations of $(9.4) million, or $(0.35) per diluted share for 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the after-tax loss on disposal of the Wiring business of $8.6 million in 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $54.4 million and $43.0 million, respectively. The increase during 2015 was primarily due to improved working capital and earnings. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had $100.0 million in borrowings outstanding on our $300.0 million Credit Facility.\nOutlook\nWe expect improved financial performance in 2016 compared to 2015 because of new product launches and functional cost improvements.\nWe expect to have significant sales growth in our North American automotive vehicle market in 2016 related to new product launches including our shift by wire product by our Control Devices segment. Also, the North American automotive vehicle market production is expected to increase to 18.2 million units in 2016 (an increase from the 17.5 million units produced in 2015), which we expect to have a favorable effect on our Control Devices segment.\nThe North American commercial vehicle market improved in 2015, but is expected to decline in 2016 while the European commercial vehicle market in 2016 is forecasted to remain at approximately the same level with 2015.\nOur PST segment revenues and operating performance continue to be adversely impacted by weakness of the Brazilian economy and automotive market and was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation. In January 2016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its forecasts for the Brazil gross domestic product to decline 3.5% in 2016 and 0.0% in 2017. Based on the weakness in PST's sales and operating performance during 2015 and lower forecasted growth of the Brazilian economy in 2016, PST's sales and earnings growth expectations continue to be moderated for 2016. As there is significant uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of a recovery in the Brazilian economy and automotive market, PST continues to realign its cost structure to mitigate the effect on earnings of possible continued weakened product demand and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe regularly evaluate the performance of our businesses and their cost structures, including personnel, and make necessary changes thereto in order to optimize our results. We also evaluate the required skill sets of our personnel and periodically make strategic changes. As a consequence of these actions, we incur severance related costs which we refer to as business realignment charges.\nA significant portion of our sales are outside of the United States. These sales are generated by our non-U.S. based operations, and therefore, movements in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on our results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant portion of our raw materials purchased by our Electronics and PST segments are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore movements in foreign currency exchange rates can also have a significant effect on our results of operations. While the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the Swedish krona, euro and Brazilian real in 2015 increasing our material costs and reducing our reported results, we expect that the U.S. dollar will continue to strengthen against these currencies, but at a moderated pace in 2016.\nBecause of the competitive nature of the markets we serve, we face pricing pressures from our customers in the ordinary course of business. In response to these pricing pressures we have been able to effectively manage our production costs by the combination of lowering certain costs and limiting the increase of others, the net impact of which has not been material. However, if we are unable to effectively manage production costs in the future to mitigate future pricing pressures, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared To Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales are presented in the following table (in thousands):\n\nNet Sales. Net sales for our reportable segments, excluding inter-segment sales are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\n\nOur Control Devices segment net sales increased primarily due to new product sales and growth in the North American automotive market and new program sales in our China automotive market of $22.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively, as well as slightly higher volume in our commercial vehicle market during 2015. These were offset by a decrease in agricultural sales volume of $1.0 million.\nOur Electronics segment net sales increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume of our European commercial vehicle products of $16.9 million as well as an increase in sales of our North American commercial vehicle products of $16.6 million (from higher volume related to an increase in post-disposition sales to the Wiring business acquired by Motherson of $15.0 million), which were substantially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation of $28.8 million, or 13.5%, and European commercial vehicle contractual price reductions of $2.4 million.\nOur PST segment net sales decreased primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation which reduced sales by $38.1 million, or 27.3%, and lower product volume. Also, PST's audio/car alarm sales volume declined due to further weakening of the Brazilian economy and automotive market while monitoring service sales volume increased.\nNet sales by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in North American net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales in our North American Control Devices' automotive and Electronics' commercial vehicle markets of $22.8 million and $16.6 million, respectively, which were partially offset by decreased agricultural volume of $1.0 million. The decrease in net sales in South America was primarily due to the impact of an unfavorable foreign currency translation and was also negatively impacted by lower product sales volume as a result of the weakened economic conditions in Brazil. Our decrease in net sales in Europe and Other was primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation, which was substantially offset by increased sales of European commercial vehicle and Chinese automotive market products of $16.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin. Cost of goods sold decreased by 0.4% primarily due to foreign currency translation resulting from changes in exchange rates between the functional currency of our Electronics and PST segments compared to the U.S. dollar. Offsetting the decline from foreign currency translation, cost of goods was negatively impacted by higher material costs resulting from significantly more unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year. Our material cost as a percentage of net sales increased to 51.2% for 2015 compared to 49.2% for 2014. As a result, our gross margin decreased by 1.5% to 27.4% for 2015 compared to 28.9% for 2014. The higher material costs were due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates in our Electronics segment, which were partially offset by lower material costs in our Control Devices segment. The Company purchases the majority of its materials under contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. As such, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Swedish krona, euro and Brazilian real throughout 2015 increased the material costs in our Electronics and PST segments.\nOur Control Devices segment gross margin increased due to increased sales volume, lower material costs, a favorable mix of products sold and product redesign, which were partially offset by higher warranty costs principally related to one product and higher profit sharing.\nOur Electronics segment gross margin decreased primarily due to higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of which was moderated by our foreign currency hedges.\nOur PST segment gross margin remained flat as higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates were offset by a favorable sales mix, prices increases, product redesign, new supplier sourcing and lower business realignment charges. PST business realignment charges decreased to $0.2 million for 2015 from $0.9 million for 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d). SG&A expenses decreased by $13.3 million compared to 2014 as lower costs in our PST and Electronics segments were partially offset by higher costs in our unallocated corporate and Control Devices segments. SG&A costs in our PST and Electronics segments decreased primarily due to foreign currency translation resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A costs in our unallocated corporate segment increased due to higher incentive-based compensation, higher recruitment, business realignment charges of $0.3 million and higher share-based compensation of $2.2 million in connection with the accelerated vesting associated with the retirement of our former President and CEO in June 2015, which were partially offset by lower professional fees. SG&A costs in our Control Devices segment increased primarily due to higher legal fees related to product litigation and an increase in incentive-based compensation. SG&A business realignment charges related to our Electronics, PST and unallocated corporate segments were $0.5 million for 2015 compared to $0.5 million related to PST for 2014.\nDesign and Development ( D&D\u201d). D&D costs decreased by $2.8 million primarily due to foreign currency translation resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates in our PST and Electronics segments which was offset by a slight increase in product development costs in our Control Devices segment. D&D business realignment charges related to our Electronics and PST segments were $0.3 million for 2015 compared to $0.2 million related to PST for 2014.\nGoodwill Impairment. A goodwill impairment of $51.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to our PST segment. The impairment was due to the weakening of both the Brazilian economy and automotive market resulting in lower projected revenue and earnings growth. This non-cash impairment is more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) is summarized in the following table by reportable segment (in thousands):\n\nNM - not meaningful\nOur Control Devices segment operating income increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume, lower material costs, a favorable mix of products sold and product redesign, which were partially offset by higher warranty, SG&A and D&D costs.\nOur Electronics segment operating income decreased due to a lower gross profit as material costs increased as a result of an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and $0.3 million of business realignment charges incurred in the current year, which were partially offset by lower SG&A and D&D costs resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur PST segment operating performance improved as 2014 results included a goodwill impairment charge of $51.5 million that was recorded in 2014. Excluding the goodwill impairment, PST's operating performance improved by $0.5 million due to lower business realignment charges of $1.2 million, which were $0.4 million and $1.6 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, as price increases, significant material cost reductions achieved from product redesign and new supplier sourcing were more than offset by significantly higher material costs resulting from more unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year.\nOur unallocated corporate operating loss increased primarily due to higher share-based compensation primarily as a result of the acceleration of the vesting associated with the June 2015 retirement of our President and CEO of $2.2 million, higher incentive-based compensation, higher recruitment costs and business realignment charges of $0.3 million during 2015, which were partially offset by lower professional fees.\nOperating income (loss) by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\n\nOur North American operating results increased due to higher sales in the North American automotive and commercial vehicle markets, lower material costs and a favorable change in product mix, which was substantially offset by higher incentive-based and share-based compensation expense. The improved performance in South America was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $51.5 million taken in 2014. Our results in Europe and Other declined slightly as higher material costs and an unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates related to our Electronics segment were offset by higher sales and gross profit in our China automotive market.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense, net decreased by $10.5 million compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower average debt balance outstanding and a lower weighted-average interest rate. We redeemed our $175.0 million 9.5% senior notes in September and October 2014 using borrowings of $100.0 million on our Credit Facility (which bore annual interest for 2015 of approximately 3.0%), proceeds from the sale of the Wiring business and existing cash.\nEquity in Earnings of Investee. Equity earnings for Minda decreased to $0.6 million in 2015 from $0.8 million in 2014. While sales increased slightly over the prior year, the increase was more than offset by higher operating and financing costs and was negatively impacted by an unfavorable change in foreign currency translation.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The Company recognized debt extinguishment loss of $10.6 million during 2014 due to the redemption of our senior notes and modification of our Credit Facility. The specific components of the debt extinguishment loss are described in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Expense, net. We record certain foreign currency transaction and forward currency hedge contract gains and losses as a component of other expense, net in the consolidated statement", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

These were offset by a decrease in agricultural sales volume of $1.0 million.\nOur Electronics segment net sales increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume of our European commercial vehicle products of $16.9 million as well as an increase in sales of our North American commercial vehicle products of $16.6 million (from higher volume related to an increase in post-disposition sales to the Wiring business acquired by Motherson of $15.0 million), which were substantially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation of $28.8 million, or 13.5%, and European commercial vehicle contractual price reductions of $2.4 million.\nOur PST segment net sales decreased primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation which reduced sales by $38.1 million, or 27.3%, and lower product volume. Also, PST's audio/car alarm sales volume declined due to further weakening of the Brazilian economy and automotive market while monitoring service sales volume increased.\nNet sales by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>369,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>330,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>South America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,522 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe and Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,761 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>644,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>660,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,767 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in North American net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales in our North American Control Devices' automotive and Electronics' commercial vehicle markets of $22.8 million and $16.6 million, respectively, which were partially offset by decreased agricultural volume of $1.0 million. The decrease in net sales in South America was primarily due to the impact of an unfavorable foreign currency translation and was also negatively impacted by lower product sales volume as a result of the weakened economic conditions in Brazil. Our decrease in net sales in Europe and Other was primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency translation, which was substantially offset by increased sales of European commercial vehicle and Chinese automotive market products of $16.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin. Cost of goods sold decreased by 0.4% primarily due to foreign currency translation resulting from changes in exchange rates between the functional currency of our Electronics and PST segments compared to the U.S. dollar. Offsetting the decline from foreign currency translation, cost of goods was negatively impacted by higher material costs resulting from significantly more unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year. Our material cost as a percentage of net sales increased to 51.2% for 2015 compared to 49.2% for 2014. As a result, our gross margin decreased by 1.5% to 27.4% for 2015 compared to 28.9% for 2014. The higher material costs were due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates in our Electronics segment, which were partially offset by lower material costs in our Control Devices segment. The Company purchases the majority of its materials under contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. As such, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Swedish krona, euro and Brazilian real throughout 2015 increased the material costs in our Electronics and PST segments.\nOur Control Devices segment gross margin increased due to increased sales volume, lower material costs, a favorable mix of products sold and product redesign, which were partially offset by higher warranty costs principally related to one product and higher profit sharing.\nOur Electronics segment gross margin decreased primarily due to higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of which was moderated by our foreign currency hedges.\nOur PST segment gross margin remained flat as higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates were offset by a favorable sales mix, prices increases, product redesign, new supplier sourcing and lower business realignment charges. PST business realignment charges decreased to $0.2 million for 2015 from $0.9 million for 2014.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d). SG&A expenses decreased by $13.3 million compared to 2014 as lower costs in our PST and Electronics segments were partially offset by higher costs in our unallocated corporate and Control Devices segments. SG&A costs in our PST and Electronics segments decreased primarily due to foreign currency translation resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A costs in our unallocated corporate segment increased due to higher incentive-based compensation, higher recruitment, business realignment charges of $0.3 million and higher share-based compensation of $2.2 million in connection with the accelerated vesting associated with the retirement of our former President and CEO in June 2015, which were partially offset by lower professional fees. SG&A costs in our Control Devices segment increased primarily due to higher legal fees related to product litigation and an increase in incentive-based compensation. SG&A business realignment charges related to our Electronics, PST and unallocated corporate segments were $0.5 million for 2015 compared to $0.5 million related to PST for 2014.\nDesign and Development ( D&D\u201d). D&D costs decreased by $2.8 million primarily due to foreign currency translation resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates in our PST and Electronics segments which was offset by a slight increase in product development costs in our Control Devices segment. D&D business realignment charges related to our Electronics and PST segments were $0.3 million for 2015 compared to $0.2 million related to PST for 2014.\nGoodwill Impairment. A goodwill impairment of $51.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to our PST segment. The impairment was due to the weakening of both the Brazilian economy and automotive market resulting in lower projected revenue and earnings growth. This non-cash impairment is more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) is summarized in the following table by reportable segment (in thousands):\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Control Devices </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Electronics </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,660 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PST </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,542 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59,587 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unallocated corporate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,117 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,067 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,050 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM - not meaningful\nOur Control Devices segment operating income increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume, lower material costs, a favorable mix of products sold and product redesign, which were partially offset by higher warranty, SG&A and D&D costs.\nOur Electronics segment operating income decreased due to a lower gross profit as material costs increased as a result of an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and $0.3 million of business realignment charges incurred in the current year, which were partially offset by lower SG&A and D&D costs resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur PST segment operating performance improved as 2014 results included a goodwill impairment charge of $51.5 million that was recorded in 2014. Excluding the goodwill impairment, PST's operating performance improved by $0.5 million due to lower business realignment charges of $1.2 million, which were $0.4 million and $1.6 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, as price increases, significant material cost reductions achieved from product redesign and new supplier sourcing were more than offset by significantly higher material costs resulting from more unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year.\nOur unallocated corporate operating loss increased primarily due to higher share-based compensation primarily as a result of the acceleration of the vesting associated with the June 2015 retirement of our President and CEO of $2.2 million, higher incentive-based compensation, higher recruitment costs and business realignment charges of $0.3 million during 2015, which were partially offset by lower professional fees.\nOperating income (loss) by geographic location are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>increase / </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>North America </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>South America </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,542 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59,587 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe and Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(248 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,823 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur North American operating results increased due to higher sales in the North American automotive and commercial vehicle markets, lower material costs and a favorable change in product mix, which was substantially offset by higher incentive-based and share-based compensation expense. The improved performance in South America was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $51.5 million taken in 2014. Our results in Europe and Other declined slightly as higher material costs and an unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates related to our Electronics segment were offset by higher sales and gross profit in our China automotive market.\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense, net decreased by $10.5 million compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower average debt balance outstanding and a lower weighted-average interest rate. We redeemed our $175.0 million 9.5% senior notes in September and October 2014 using borrowings of $100.0 million on our Credit Facility (which bore annual interest for 2015 of approximately 3.0%), proceeds from the sale of the Wiring business and existing cash.\nEquity in Earnings of Investee. Equity earnings for Minda decreased to $0.6 million in 2015 from $0.8 million in 2014. While sales increased slightly over the prior year, the increase was more than offset by higher operating and financing costs and was negatively impacted by an unfavorable change in foreign currency translation.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The Company recognized debt extinguishment loss of $10.6 million during 2014 due to the redemption of our senior notes and modification of our Credit Facility. The specific components of the debt extinguishment loss are described in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Expense, net. We record certain foreign currency transaction and forward currency hedge contract gains and losses as a component of other expense, net in the consolidated statement"}
