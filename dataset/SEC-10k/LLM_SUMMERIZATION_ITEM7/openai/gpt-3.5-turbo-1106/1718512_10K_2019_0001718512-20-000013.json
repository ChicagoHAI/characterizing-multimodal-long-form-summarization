This discussion and analysis addresses Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. For discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2019. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d above.\nOur Company\nWe are a global manufacturer of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers and to original equipment ( first-fit\u201d) manufacturers as specified components, with the majority of our revenue coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, which include construction, agriculture, energy, automotive, transportation, general industrial, consumer products and many others. We sell our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers, installers and end users as a premium brand for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built for over a century since Gates' founding in 1911. Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are often critical components in applications for which the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to normal wear and tear, resulting in a natural replacement cycle that drives high-margin, recurring revenue. Our product portfolio represents one of the broadest ranges of power transmission and fluid power products in the markets we serve, and we maintain long-standing relationships with a diversified group of blue-chip customers throughout the world. As a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered, mission-critical products, we have become an industry leader across most of the regions and end markets in which we operate.\nBusiness Trends\nOur net sales have historically been, and remain, highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement channels. This diversification limits our exposure to trends in any given end market. In addition, a majority of our sales are generated from customers in replacement channels, who serve primarily a large base of installed equipment that follows a natural maintenance cycle that is somewhat less susceptible to various trends that affect our end markets. Such trends include infrastructure investment and construction activity, agricultural production and related commodity prices, commercial and passenger vehicle production, miles driven and fleet age, evolving regulatory requirements related to emissions and fuel economy and oil and gas prices and production. Key indicators of our performance include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, sales into replacement channels accounted for approximately 63% of our total net sales. Our replacement sales cover a very broad range of applications and industries and, accordingly, are highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization and not a single end market. Replacement products are principally sold through distribution partners that may carry a very broad line of products or may specialize in products associated with a smaller set of end market applications.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, sales into first-fit channels accounted for approximately 37% of our total net sales. First-fit sales are to a variety of industrial and automotive customers. Our industrial first-fit customers cover a diverse range of industries and applications and many of our largest first-fit customers manufacture construction and agricultural equipment. Among our automotive first-fit customers, a majority of our net sales are to emerging market customers, where we believe our first-fit presence provides us with a strategic advantage in developing those markets and ultimately increasing our higher margin replacement channel sales. First-fit automotive sales in developed markets represented approximately 7% of our total net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019, with first-fit automotive sales in North America contributing less than 3% of total sales. As a result of the foregoing factors, we do not believe that our historical consolidated net sales have had any meaningful correlation to global automotive production but are positively correlated to industrial production.\nOur recently completed manufacturing footprint investments and other productivity improvements in recent years have helped to position us to continue to make progress on our restructuring program, which is primarily intended to optimize our manufacturing and distribution footprint over the mid-term by removing structural fixed costs, and, to a lesser degree, to streamline our selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) back-office functions. We anticipate that most of the costs associated with these actions will be incurred during 2020 and 2021. Some of these costs will, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, be classified in cost of sales, negatively impacting gross margin, but due to their nature and impact of hindering comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses, they will be excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, consistent with the treatment of similar costs in the current and prior years.\nResults for the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the results for the year ended December 29, 2018\nSummary Gates Performance\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,087.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,347.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>1,944.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,017.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>1,142.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,330.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>777.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>805.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction-related expenses\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of intangibles and other assets\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>346.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>496.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>157.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expenses\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before taxes\n</td> <td>198.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(495.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>694.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>611.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>755.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income from continuing operations, the closest comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods presented.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net sales\nNet sales during the year ended December 28, 2019 were $3,087.1 million, down by 7.8%, or $260.5 million, compared with net sales during the prior year of $3,347.6 million. Our net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019 were adversely impacted by movements in average currency exchange rates of $77.0 million compared with the prior year, due principally to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, including the Euro ($31.7 million), the Chinese Renminbi ($13.6 million), the Brazilian Real ($7.9 million) and the Canadian dollar ($6.7 million). In addition, the acquisition of Rapro in April 2018 contributed $7.5 million to our net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019. Excluding these impacts, core sales decreased by $191.0 million, or 5.7%, during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to lower volumes of $249.3 million, offset partially by a $58.3 million benefit from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions.\nCore sales in our Power Transmission and Fluid Power businesses declined by 4.6% and 7.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 28, 2019. Globally, these declines arose primarily in sales to our industrial customers, with these sales declining by $113.2 million on a core basis, compared with a $77.8 million decline in core sales to our automotive customers. Industrial first-fit and replacement sales declined by 6.9% and 6.5%, respectively, during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, driven primarily by declines in the agriculture and construction end markets in North America. Sales to the industrial end markets in Greater China and East Asia & India both were down during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, driven by a 7.9% decline in the general industrial end markets in both regions, with increasing weakness in construction equipment sales as the year has progressed. This was broadly offset by growth in sales to the industrial end markets in EMEA, with growth across all end markets except for agriculture.\nGlobal sales to the automotive end markets declined by 6.3% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, driven by sales to first-fit customers, which declined by 9.2% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. The decline in automotive end market sales was driven mostly by the broad economic softness in EMEA, with sales from this region declining by 13.6%, or $70.5 million, during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. Growth in Greater China and South America was flat, but the other regions declined by low single digits on a percentage basis as compared with the prior year.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $1,944.6 million, a decrease of 3.6%, or $72.4 million, compared with $2,017.0 million for the prior year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower volumes of $110.9 million, favorable movements in average currency exchange rates of $51.8 million, and $33.8 million of benefits from our procurement initiatives. These decreases were offset primarily by $63.2 million of a combination of wage and material inflation and $47.2 million from lower manufacturing performance driven by the lower absorption of fixed costs on lower production volumes and some excess variable costs as we continued to adjust our production costs to align with the demand outlook. In addition, cost of sales for the year ended December 28, 2019 was adversely impacted by $10.1 million of increases in tariffs and $7.0 million of higher depreciation relating primarily to the new facilities opened in 2018, compared with the prior year.\nGross profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $1,142.5 million, down 14.1% from $1,330.6 million for the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes of $138.4 million, $47.2 million of lower manufacturing performance driven by the lower absorption of fixed costs on lower production volumes, $63.2 million of unfavorable wage and material inflation, and $25.2 million of unfavorable movements in average currency exchange rates, offset by a $58.3 million benefit from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions and $33.8 million of benefits from our procurement initiatives.\nOur gross profit margin dropped by 270 basis points to 37.0% for the year ended December 28, 2019. Excluding the impact of facility closure-related inventory impairments of $1.2 million and $4.0 million of involuntary termination benefits paid in relation to permanent reductions in force, primarily in Asia and North America, gross margin was 37.2%, down from 39.7% for the prior year. In both cases, these decreases were driven by the factors described above.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $777.3 million compared with $805.8 million for the prior year. This decrease of $28.5 million was driven primarily by $17.8 million of favorable impacts from movements in average currency exchange rates and $12.1 million of net labor-related benefits which related primarily to headcount reductions and lower variable compensation, offset partially by higher stock-based compensation.\nTransaction-related expenses\nTransaction-related expenses for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $2.6 million compared with an expense of $6.7 million for the prior year. Net expenses for the year ended December 28, 2019 related primarily to exploratory merger and acquisition activity, as well as to corporate filings and transactions to provide the Company with flexibility for future raising of capital and debt, share buybacks and dividend payments. These expenses were offset partially by the release of an accrual from a prior period acquisition. The transaction-related expenses incurred in the prior year included $4.2 million related to our initial public offering and a further $0.3 million related to the extension in January 2018 of the maturity of our two revolving credit facilities. The remainder of the transaction-related expenses in the prior year related to the recent business acquisitions.\nRestructuring expenses\nWe continue to make progress on our restructuring program, which, as described further under Business Trends\u201d above, is primarily intended to optimize our manufacturing and distribution footprint over the mid-term by removing structural fixed costs, and, to a lesser degree, to streamline our SG&A back-office functions.\nRestructuring expenses of $7.2 million were recognized during the year ended December 28, 2019, including an impairment of inventory of $1.2 million due to facility closures and consolidations, which is included in cost of sales. The remainder of the expenses related primarily to severance costs, predominantly due to the closure of one of our facilities in France, a refocusing of operations in our Galesburg, Illinois facility, and a strategic restructuring of part of our Asian business. Restructuring expenses of $7.3 million were recognized during the prior year, related primarily to the implementation of our European corporate center and a strategic restructuring of part of our Asian business. Also included in restructuring expenses in the prior year was an impairment of inventory of $0.9 million, which was recognized in cost of sales.\nInterest expense\nOur interest expense was as follows:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar Term Loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro Term Loan\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar Senior Notes\n</td> <td>35.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro Senior Notes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other loans\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>138.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred issuance costs\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other interest expense\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetails of our long-term debt are presented in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nInterest on debt for the year ended December 28, 2019 decreased when compared with the equivalent prior year due primarily to the interest savings from debt repayments, in particular, the repayment of $913.7 million of senior notes in the first quarter of 2018 in conjunction with our initial public offering, in addition to margin reductions that came into effect partway during the prior year. The amortization of deferred issuance costs was lower in the year ended December 28, 2019, due to the acceleration in the prior year of $15.4 million of deferred issuance cost amortization as a consequence of the repayment of debt during the first quarter of 2018. This benefit was offset partially by the accelerated amortization of deferred issuance costs of $6.1 million during the current year, due to prepayment of our outstanding 6.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes\u201d) as part of the refinancing transactions described further in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOther (income) expenses\nOur other (income) expenses were as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on bank deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency gain on net debt and hedging instruments\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums paid on debt redemptions\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net adjustments related to post-retirement benefits\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $9.8 million, compared with an expense of $17.4 million in the prior year. This change was driven primarily by the payment in the prior year of $27.0 million of redemption premiums on repayment of the Euro Senior Notes and partial repayment of the 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes in January and February of 2018. Partially offsetting this cost in the prior year was a $5.8 million gain on a derivative used to lock in the exchange rate used to repay the Euro Senior Notes. Higher expected returns on plan assets based on actuarial valuations drove the majority of the remaining increase in other (income) expenses during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nFor the year ended December 28, 2019, we had an income tax benefit of $495.9 million on pre-tax income of $198.8 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of (249.4%) compared with an income tax expense of $31.8 million on pre-tax income of $303.5 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 10.5% for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nOur effective tax rate for the year ended December 28, 2019 is lower than our effective tax rate for the year ended December 29, 2018 primarily due to a $579.0 million tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, partially offset by $59.7 million of tax expense from related unrecognized tax benefits, both of which resulted from the implementation of our European corporate center. Excluding these one-time impacts our 2019 effective tax rate would have been 11.8%, which is slightly higher when compared to our 2018 effective rate of 10.5%. This was driven by certain one-time tax benefits in 2018, including $37.6 million of tax benefits for manufacturing incentives, unrecognized tax benefits, and changes in valuation allowances, which were partially offset by $16.0 million of increase in tax on international operations and U.S. base erosion and anti-abuse tax. In addition, in 2019 our tax on international operations was lower by $19.9 million than in 2018, which was partially offset by an increase of $7.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities\nWe recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences arising from differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets, weighing all positive and negative evidence, and are required to establish or maintain a valuation allowance for these assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. If negative evidence exists, positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.\nOur framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires us to weigh all available evidence, including:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>taxable income in prior carry back years if carry back is permitted under the relevant tax law;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>future reversal of existing temporary differences;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>tax-planning strategies that are prudent and feasible; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> After weighing all of the evidence, giving more weight to the evidence that was objectively verifiable, we determined in 2019 that it was more likely than not that deferred income tax assets in Luxembourg, the U.K., and the U.S. totaling $586.2 million were realizable.\nIncluded within the $586.2 million total deferred income tax assets are deferred income tax assets totaling $579.0 million related to \u20ac2.1 billion of indefinite lived net operating losses in Luxembourg for which our evaluation of the positive and negative evidence changed during the first quarter of 2019 due to the implementation of our European corporate center. Our European corporate center was implemented in 2019 to centralize and strengthen regional operations in Europe, which thereafter became centrally managed from Luxembourg.\nThe positive evidence that existed in favor of releasing the allowance as of December 28, 2019 and ultimately outweighed the negative evidence included the following:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our profitability in Europe in 2018 and prior years and for 2019, as well as our expectations regarding the sustainability of these profits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of the implementation of our European corporate center, which created an expectation of future income in Luxembourg and, thereby, removed negative evidence that supported maintaining the valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets as of December 29, 2018; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the fact that our net operating loss carryforwards in Luxembourg are indefinite lived.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Further, as a result of additional financing income realized in 2019 that created taxable profits in the U.K., combined with our estimate that the financing income is likely to remain as a source of income through 2024, our judgment changed in the first quarter of 2019 regarding valuation allowances totaling $6.1 million related to indefinite lived net operating losses in the U.K.\nFinally, as a result of changes in estimates of future taxable profits in the first quarter of 2019, our judgment changed regarding the realizability of $1.1 million of U.S. foreign tax credits with related recorded valuation allowances.\nAs of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to the future realization of deferred income tax assets. We will maintain our positions with regard to future realization of deferred income tax assets, including those with respect to which we continue maintaining valuation allowances, until there is sufficient new evidence to support a change in expectations. Such a change in expectations could arise due to many factors, including those impacting our forecasts of future earnings, as well as changes in the international tax laws under which we operate and tax planning. It is not reasonably possible to forecast any such changes at the present time, but it is possible that, should they arise, our view of their effect on the future realization of deferred income tax assets may impact materially our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $611.0 million, a decrease of 19.2% or $144.8 million, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $755.8 million for the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.8% for the year ended December 28, 2019, a 280 basis point decrease from the prior year margin of 22.6%. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by reduced gross profit of $188.1 million, which was primarily the result of lower sales of $260.5 million, as well as the impact of lower fixed cost absorption on cost of sales as described above. Partially offsetting this decrease were lower SG&A expenses as noted above.\nFor a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented and the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA margin, see -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nAnalysis by Operating Segment\nPower Transmission (63.0% of Gates' net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019)\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period over Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,945.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,098.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>492.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in Power Transmission for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $1,945.7 million, a decrease of 7.3%, or $153.1 million, when compared with the prior year net sales of $2,098.8 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $56.5 million, core sales decreased by 4.6%, or $96.6 million, compared with the prior year. The majority of this decrease was due to lower sales volumes of $123.1 million, offset partially by benefits from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions.\nPower Transmission's core growth decline was driven by a decrease in sales to automotive first-fit customers, which decreased by 9.2% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, due primarily to weak demand in Europe and Greater China resulting from a combination of market softness, macroeconomic headwinds and continuing trade tensions. A decrease in sales to automotive replacement customers also contributed to the decline, but less significantly, with core sales lower by 3.1% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. Sales into the industrial end markets were relatively flat during the year ended December 28, 2019. General industrial end market sales declined by 3.4%, driven primarily by East Asia & India and Greater China, but this was decline was mostly offset by growth in all other regions, particularly in EMEA.\nOur Power Transmission Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $412.6 million, a decrease of 16.2% or $79.6 million, compared with the prior year Adjusted EBITDA of $492.2 million. Movements in average currency exchange rates drove $10.5 million of this decrease. Excluding this impact, the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by similar factors as described above with lower volumes of $64.7 million, $39.6 million of unfavorable wage and material inflation and lower manufacturing performance of $25.8 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were benefits from procurement initiatives of $24.7 million, benefits from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions of $26.5 million and lower SG&A spend. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 28, 2019 was 21.2%, a 230 basis point decline from the prior year Adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.5%, driven by the impacts described above.\nFluid Power (37.0% of Gates' net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019)\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period over\nPeriod Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,141.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,248.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in Fluid Power for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $1,141.4 million, a decrease of 8.6%, or $107.4 million, compared with net sales during the prior year of $1,248.8 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $20.5 million and the benefit of $7.5 million from the acquisition of Rapro in April 2018, core sales decreased by 7.6%, or $94.4 million, compared with the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to lower volumes of $126.2 million, offset partially by benefits from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions.\nThe lower core sales growth in the year ended December 28, 2019 was driven almost exclusively by a decrease in sales to industrial end markets, which declined by 8.8% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. This decrease was driven by the agriculture and construction end markets, which have continued to be challenging, declining by 18.8% and 8.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 28, 2019, compared with the prior year, primarily in North America. Fluid Power's sales to automotive end markets were flat during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, with sales in the emerging markets outperforming sales to the developed markets.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $198.4 million, a decrease of 24.7%, or $65.2 million, compared with the prior year Adjusted EBITDA of $263.6 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily lower volumes of $68.3 million, a $23.6 million adverse impact from inflation and lower manufacturing performance of $21.4 million driven by lower fixed cost absorption on lower volumes and some excess variable costs. These impacts were offset partially by a $31.8 million benefit from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions and a $10.8 million benefit from our procurement initiatives. The Adjusted EBITDA margin consequently decreased by 370 basis points.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTreasury Responsibilities and Philosophy\nOur primary liquidity and capital resource needs are for working capital, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, facility expansions and acquisitions. We expect to finance our future cash requirements with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and, where necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We have historically relied on our cash flow from operations and various debt and equity financings for liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we enter into currency derivative contracts to manage currency transaction exposures. Similarly from time to time, we may enter into interest rate derivatives to maintain the desired mix of floating and fixed rate debt.\nAs market conditions warrant, we and our majority equity holders, Blackstone and its affiliates, may from time to time, seek to repurchase securities that we have issued or loans that we have borrowed in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any such purchases may be funded by existing cash or by incurring new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may relate to a substantial amount of a particular tranche of debt, with a corresponding reduction, where relevant, in the trading liquidity of that debt. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the adjusted issue price\u201d (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which may be material, and result in related adverse tax consequences to us.\nIt is our policy to retain sufficient liquidity throughout the capital expenditure cycle to maintain our financial flexibility. We do not anticipate any material long-term deterioration in our overall liquidity position in the foreseeable future, and we believe that as of December 28, 2019, we have adequate liquidity and capital resources for the next twelve months.\nCash Flow\nYear ended December 28, 2019 compared with the year ended December 29, 2018\nCash provided by operations was $348.9 million during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with cash provided by operations of $313.5 million during the prior year. Operating cash inflow before movements in operating assets and liabilities was $290.1 million during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with $478.0 million during the prior year, a decrease of $187.9 million which was due largely to the lower operational performance which adversely impacted operating income. The movement in taxes payable, which was an increase of $46.2 million during the current year compared with a decrease of $15.3 million in the prior year, was due primarily to a non-cash increase in tax contingencies associated with our business reorganization in Europe. Movements in operating assets and liabilities other than taxes payable during the year ended December 28, 2019 gave rise to an increase of $12.6 million in cash compared with a decrease of $149.2 million in the prior year. The increase, or source of cash, during the current period was driven primarily by the decreases in trade accounts payable and inventories, both linked to lower production volumes and our continued focus on management of working capital. During the prior year, the decrease was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and inventories due to the strong demand environment at the time.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 28, 2019 was $78.0 million, compared with $243.6 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures decreased by $99.6 million from $182.7 million in the year ended December 29, 2018 to $83.1 million in the year ended December 28, 2019, driven primarily by expenditures in the prior year related to the expansion of one of our existing facilities and construction of two new facilities. Net cash used in investing activities in the prior year also included $50.9 million of cash paid in relation to the acquisition of Rapro in April 2018.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $59.3 million during the year ended December 28, 2019, compared with $198.9 million in the prior year. This net outflow in the year ended December 28, 2019 related primarily to quarterly amortization payments of $24.7 million under the term loans, together with $28.8 million of dividend payments to non-controlling shareholders of certain majority-owned subsidiaries. As described further in note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during November 2019, we issued and sold $568.0 million of unsecured 6.25% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 6.25% Dollar Senior Notes\u201d) and used the proceeds from this debt issuance in December 2019 to redeem all $568.0 million of our outstanding 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes. Costs of approximately $8.6 million were incurred in relation to these transactions, of which $8.3 million was paid during the year ended December 28, 2019.\nIn the prior year, net cash used in financing activities related primarily to the net cash received from our initial public offering of $799.1 million and the use of those funds (in addition to a portion of cash on hand) to redeem debt of $913.7 million and to pay premiums thereon of $27.0 million. In addition, during the prior year, we made $35.2 million of dividend payments to non-controlling shareholders of certain majority-owned subsidiaries.\nIndebtedness\nOur long-term debt, consisting principally of two term loans and U.S. dollar denominated unsecured notes, was as follows:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>As of\nDecember 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nDecember 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nDecember 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nDecember 29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-Secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loans (U.S. dollar and Euro denominated)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,395.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,428.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,416.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,458.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes (U.S. dollar)\n</td> <td>563.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>575.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>568.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>568.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,958.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,005.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,985.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,027.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetails of our long-term debt are presented in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nOn November 22, 2019, we issued and sold $568.0 million of 6.25% Dollar Senior Notes, described further below. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used on December 5, 2019 to redeem all $568.0 million of our outstanding 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes, plus interest accrued up to and including the redemption date of $13.2 million. The majority of the costs totaling approximately $8.6 million related to the refinancing transactions have been deferred and will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the related borrowings using the effective interest method.\nDuring January 2018, upon completion of our initial public offering, the applicable margins on each of the term loans was reduced by a further 0.25%, as agreed as part of the refinancing completed in November 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we redeemed in full our outstanding \u20ac235.0 million of Euro Senior Notes and made partial redemptions of the 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes. All of the 2018 prepayments, totaling $913.7 million in principal, $27.0 million in redemption premiums and $3.1 million in accrued interest, were funded primarily by the net proceeds from our IPO, with the remainder of the funds coming from cash on hand.\nA wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of Gates Global LLC is the principal obligor under the Term Loans for U.S. federal income tax purposes and makes the payments due on this tranche of debt. As a result, interest received by lenders of this tranche of debt is U.S. source income.\nDollar and Euro Term Loans\nOur secured credit facilities include a Dollar Term Loan credit facility and a Euro Term Loan credit facility that were drawn on July 3, 2014. These facilities mature on March 31, 2024. These term loan facilities bear interest at a floating rate. As of December 28, 2019, borrowings under the Dollar Term Loan facility, which currently bears interest at LIBOR, subject to a floor of 1.00%, plus a margin of 2.75%, bore interest at a rate of 4.45% per annum. The Dollar Term Loan interest rate is re-set on the last business day of each month. As of December 28, 2019, the Euro Term Loan bore interest at EURIBOR, which is currently below 0%, subject to a floor of 0%, plus a margin of 3.00%. The Euro Term Loan interest rate is re-set on the last business day of each quarter.\nBoth term loans are subject to quarterly amortization payments of 0.25%, based on the original principal amount less certain prepayments with the balance payable on maturity. During the year ended December 28, 2019, we made amortization payments against the Dollar Term Loan and the Euro Term Loan of $17.3 million and $7.4 million, respectively. During the year ended December 29, 2018, we made amortization payments against the Dollar Term Loan and the Euro Term Loan of $13.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively.\nUnder the terms of the credit agreement, we are obliged to offer annually to the term loan lenders an excess cash flow\u201d amount as defined under the agreement, based on the preceding year's final results. Based on our 2019 results, the leverage ratio as defined under the credit agreement was below the threshold above which payments are required, and therefore no excess cash flow payment will be required to be made in 2020.\nDuring the periods presented, foreign exchange gains were recognized in respect of the Euro Term Loans as summarized in the table below. As a portion of the facility was designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our Euro investments, a corresponding portion of the foreign exchange gains (losses) were recognized in other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d). Table 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain recognized in statement of operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss recognized in OCI\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gain\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, the above net foreign exchange gains recognized in the other (income) expenses line have been substantially offset by net foreign exchange movements on Euro-denominated intercompany loans as part of our overall hedging strategy.\nOur Term Loans, which mature after 2021, use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and is not expected to be maintained after 2021. The transition to alternatives to LIBOR could be modestly disruptive to credit markets, and while we don't believe that the impact would be material to us, we do not yet have insight into what those impacts might be.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had $568.0 million of 6.25% Dollar Senior Notes outstanding that were issued in November 2019. These notes are scheduled to mature on January 15, 2026 and bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 6.25% with semi-annual interest payments.\nOn and after January 15, 2022, we may redeem the 6.25% Dollar Senior Notes, at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Redemption Price\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>During the year commencing:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-2022\n</td> <td>103.125\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-2023\n</td> <td>101.563\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-2024 and thereafter\n</td> <td>100.000\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, net cash proceeds from an equity offering can be utilized at any time prior to January 15, 2022, to redeem up to 40% of the notes at a redemption price equal to 106.250% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest through to the redemption date.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control or a certain qualifying asset sales, the holders of the notes will have the right to require us to make an offer to repurchase each holder's notes at a price equal to 101% (in the case of a change of control) or 100% (in the case of an asset sale) of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nAs noted above, on December 5, 2019, we redeemed in full all $568.0 million of our outstanding 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes due in 2022, and, on January 31, 2018, we redeemed in full all \u20ac235.0 million of our outstanding Euro Senior Notes and made partial redemptions of the outstanding 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes due in 2022 totaling $622.0 million.\nUp to the date of their redemption, foreign exchange losses of $9.2 million were recognized in respect of the Euro Senior Notes. Of these losses, $5.0 million was recognized in OCI for the period during which the facility was designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our Euro investments, and $4.2 million was recognized in the statement of operations.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe also have a secured revolving credit facility, maturing on January 29, 2023, that provides for multi-currency revolving loans up to an aggregate principal amount of $185.0 million, with a letter of credit sub-facility of $20.0 million. This facility matures on January 29, 2023.\nAs of both December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, there were no drawings for cash under the revolving credit facility and there were no letters of credit outstanding.\nAsset-Backed Revolver\nWe have a revolving credit facility backed by certain of our assets in North America. The facility allows for loans of up to a maximum of $325.0 million ($294.6 million as of December 28, 2019, compared with $325.0 million as of December 29, 2018, based on the values of the secured assets on those dates) with a letter of credit sub-facility of $150.0 million within this maximum. The facility matures on January 29, 2023.\nAs of both December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, there were no drawings for cash under the asset-backed revolver, but there were letters of credit outstanding of $50.1 million and $57.8 million, respectively.\nNon-guarantor subsidiaries\nThe majority of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries are guarantors of the senior secured credit facilities.\nFor the year ended December 28, 2019, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 70% of our net sales and 65% of our EBITDA as defined in the financial covenants attaching to the senior secured credit facilities. As of December 28, 2019, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 54% of our total assets and approximately 21% of our total liabilities.\nNet Debt\nNet debt is a non-GAAP measure representing the principal amount of our debt less the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 28, 2019, our net debt decreased by $254.0 million from $2,603.7 million as of December 29, 2018 to $2,349.7 million as of December 28, 2019. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the decrease in net debt during the year ended December 28, 2019 was driven primarily by the increase in cash, a function of cash provided by operating activities of $348.9 million, offset partially by capital expenditures of $83.1 million and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders of $28.8 million.\nMovements in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable net impact of $17.5 million on net debt during the year ended December 28, 2019, with the majority of the movement relating to the impact of the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar on our Euro-denominated debt.\nBorrowing Headroom\nAs of December 28, 2019, our asset-backed revolving credit facility had a borrowing base of $294.6 million, being the maximum amount we can draw down based on the current value of the secured assets. The facility was undrawn for cash, but there were letters of credit outstanding against the facility amounting to $50.1 million. We also have a secured revolving credit facility that provides for multi-currency revolving loans up to an aggregate principal amount of $185.0 million.\nIn total, our committed borrowing headroom was $429.5 million, in addition to cash balances of $635.3 million.\nCash Balances\nAs of December 28, 2019, our total cash and cash equivalents were $635.3 million, compared with $423.4 million as of December 29, 2018.\nRestricted cash was $1.3 million as of December 28, 2019, compared to $1.2 million as of December 29, 2018, primarily $1.0 million as of December 28, 2019 and $1.0 million as of December 29, 2018 was held in escrow for insurance purposes. Cash held in our non-wholly owned Asian subsidiaries was $141.5 million and $130.3 million as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement that is considered to be an off-balance sheet arrangement that is required to be disclosed.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nOur consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments are summarized in the following table which includes aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 28, 2019 and the periods in which payments are due, based on the earliest date on which we could be required to settle the liabilities. The table below excludes our gross liability for uncertain tax positions of $108.8 million because the timing of cash settlement, if any, is unknown at this time.\nFloating interest payments and payments and receipts on interest rate derivatives are estimated based on market interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

During August 2019, the High Court of Justice in London sanctioned a reduction in the Company's statutory capital for the purpose of creating distributable reserves by approving the cancellation of the deferred shares in issue and the cancellation of the entire amount standing to the credit of the Company's share premium account, creating $5.5 billion of distributable reserves. These transactions, which have no impact on the consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements, facilitate the possible future payment of dividends to shareholders of the Company or possible future share repurchases.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income or loss for the period before the impact of income taxes, net interest and other expenses, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is widely used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of companies. EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense).\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as its key profitability measure. This is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA before certain items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our measure of segment profitability to assess the performance of our businesses, and it is used for total Gates as well because we believe it is important to consider our profitability on a basis that is consistent with that of our operating segments, as well as that of our peer companies with a similar leveraged, private equity ownership history. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA should, therefore, be made available to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to assist in their assessment of the performance of our businesses.\nDuring the periods presented, the items excluded from EBITDA in computing Adjusted EBITDA primarily included:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the non-cash charges in relation to share-based compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>transaction-related expenses incurred in relation to business combinations and major corporate transactions, including acquisition integration activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>impairments, comprising impairments of goodwill and significant impairments or write downs of other assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>restructuring expenses, including severance-related expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the net gain or loss on disposals and on the exit of businesses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees paid to our private equity sponsor for monitoring, advisory and consulting services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Differences exist among our businesses and from period to period in the extent to which their respective employees receive share-based compensation or a charge for such compensation is recognized. We therefore exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the non-cash charges in relation to share-based compensation in order to assess the relative performance of our businesses.\nWe exclude from Adjusted EBITDA acquisition-related costs that are required to be expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In particular, we exclude the effect on cost of sales of the uplift to the carrying amount of inventory held by entities acquired by Gates. We also exclude costs associated with major corporate transactions because we do not believe that they relate to our performance. Other items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because they are individually or collectively significant items that are not considered to be representative of the performance of our businesses. During the periods presented, we excluded restructuring expenses and severance-related expenses that reflect specific, strategic actions taken by management to shutdown, downsize, or otherwise fundamentally reorganize areas of Gates' business; the net gain or loss on disposals of assets other than in the ordinary course of operations and gains and losses incurred in relation to non-Gates businesses disposed of in prior periods; significant impairments of intangibles and of other assets, representing the excess of their carrying amounts over the amounts that are expected to be recovered from them in the future; and fees paid to our private equity sponsor.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items that can have a significant effect on our profit or loss and should, therefore, be used in conjunction with, not as substitutes for, profit or loss for the period. Management compensates for these limitations by separately monitoring net income from continuing operations for the period.\nThe following table reconciles net income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>694.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(495.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest and other expenses\n</td> <td>148.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>222.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>218.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>569.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>715.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>615.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction-related expenses\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of intangibles and other assets\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sponsor fees (included in other operating expenses)\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of fair value adjustment on inventory (included in cost of sales)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory impairments and adjustments (included in cost of sales)\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Duplicate expenses incurred on facility relocation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance-related expenses (included in cost of sales)\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other primarily severance-related expenses (included in SG&A)\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items not directly related to current operations\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>611.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>755.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>669.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales.

We makes these assumptions, estimates and judgments based on factors such as historical experience, the observance of trends in the industries in which we operate and information available from our customers and other outside sources. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions, estimates and judgments, the actual outcomes could be different. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application involves a significant amount of estimation uncertainty that increases the risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities.\nNet Sales\nWe derive our net sales primarily from the sale of a wide range of power transmission and fluid power products and components for a large variety of industrial and automotive applications, both in the aftermarket and first-fit channels, throughout the world.\nIn the substantial majority of our agreements with customers, we consider accepted customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to represent the contracts with our customers. Revenue from the sale of goods under these contracts is measured at the invoiced amount, net of estimated returns, early settlement discounts and rebates. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenues. Where a customer has the right to return goods, future returns are estimated based on historical returns profiles. Settlement discounts that may apply to unpaid invoices are estimated based on the settlement histories of the relevant customers. Our transaction prices often include variable consideration, usually in the form of discounts and rebates that may apply to issued invoices. The reduction in the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make estimates of the expected total qualifying sales to the relevant customers. These estimates, including an analysis for potential constraint on variable consideration, take into account factors such as the nature of the rebate program, historical information and expectations of customer and consumer behavior. Overall, the transaction price is reduced to reflect our estimate of the amount of consideration that is not probable of significant reversal.\nWe allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price. The product price as specified on the accepted purchase order or similar binding contract is considered to be the standalone selling price. In substantially all of our contracts with customers, our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time, rather than over a period of time, when control of the product is transferred to the customer. This occurs typically at shipment. In determining whether control has transferred and the customer is consequently able to control the use of the product for their own benefit, we consider if there is a present right to payment, legal title and physical possession has been transferred, whether the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, and the customer accepts the asset.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Assets\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to an annual impairment test but are also tested for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising in a business combination is allocated to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Where goodwill is attributable to more than one reporting unit, the goodwill is determined by allocating the purchase consideration in proportion to their respective business enterprise values and comparing the allocated purchase consideration with the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and is carried at cost less any recognized impairment.\nTo identify a potential impairment of goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is allocated is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nManagement based the fair value calculations on a weighted blend of the income and market approaches. The income approach was based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by the board of directors, in which the principal assumptions were those regarding sales growth rates, selling prices and changes in direct costs. Forecasts for the following two years were based on region-specific growth assumptions determined by management, taking into account strategic initiatives.\nCash flows for each of the reporting units for the years beyond this period were projected to grow at compound annual growth rates reflecting annual decreases over the next seven years from the 2022 growth rates to the terminal growth rate. For Gates as a whole, this growth rate was 3.7%. The terminal growth rate for both reporting units was set at 2.5%, a rate that does not exceed the expected long-term growth rates in the respective principal end markets.\nManagement applied discount rates to the resulting cash flow projections that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each reporting unit. In each case, the discount rate was determined using a capital asset pricing model. The discount rates used in the impairment tests of goodwill during Fiscal 2019 were 10.5% for both reporting units.\nFor both reporting units, the fair values exceeded the carrying values and no goodwill impairments were therefore recognized during Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018, or Fiscal 2017. However, due primarily to the current challenging market conditions and their impact on our near-term outlook, the fair values of each of the Power Transmission and Fluid Power reporting units as calculated on first day of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 were 15.8% and 14.4% lower, respectively, as compared with their fair values as calculated as part of the Fiscal 2018 annual impairment test. This has accordingly reduced the excess of the fair values of our reporting units over their carrying values. A further decline in the fair value of greater than 14% and 8% on our Power Transmission and Fluid Power reporting units, respectively, all else being equal, would result in an impairment of the goodwill allocated to those reporting units.\nWe base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating goodwill between reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units tested. Changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the period in which the change occurs and in future years.\nIndefinite-Lived Assets Other than Goodwill\nTo identify a potential impairment of indefinite-lived assets other than goodwill, the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying amount. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset exceeds its carrying amount, it is not considered impaired. Fair value is calculated based on the anticipated net cash inflows and outflows related to the indefinite-lived asset.\nDuring the periods covered by this annual report, we held indefinite-lived brand and trade name intangible assets. We test these intangibles for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and is carried at cost less any recognized impairment.\nThe fair value for our indefinite-lived brand and trade name intangible assets was determined using a relief from royalty valuation methodology in which the key assumptions included sales growth rates and an estimated royalty rate. Sales forecasts were determined on the same basis as those used for the annual impairment testing of goodwill (as described above).\nManagement applied discount rates to the calculated royalty savings that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each region in which those royalty savings arose. In each case, the discount rate was determined using a capital asset pricing model adjusted for a premium to reflect the higher risk specific to the nature of the intangible asset. The discount rates used in Fiscal 2019 impairment test was 11.5%. As a result of the impairment testing, no impairment was recognized during Fiscal 2019. However, due primarily to the current challenging market conditions and their impact on our near-term outlook, the fair value of our brand and trade name intangible assets as calculated on first day of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 was 23.3% lower than their fair value as calculated as part of the Fiscal 2018 annual impairment test. This has accordingly reduced the excess of the fair value of these assets over their carrying value. A further decline in the fair value of greater than 16%, all else being equal, would result in an impairment of the brand and trade name intangible assets.\nWe base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the period in which the change occurs and in future years.\nTaxation\nWe are subject to income tax in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Management is required to exercise significant judgment in determining our provision for income taxes. Management's judgment is required in relation to unrecognized income tax benefits whereby additional current tax may become payable in the future following the audit by tax authorities of previously-filed tax returns. It is possible that the final outcome of these unrecognized income tax benefits may differ from management's estimates.\nManagement assesses unrecognized income tax benefits based upon an evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the balance sheet date. Provision is made for unrecognized tax benefits to the extent that the amounts previously taken or expected to be taken in tax returns exceeds the tax benefits that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the tax positions. A tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements only if management considers that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant tax authority solely on the technical merits of the position and is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement assuming that the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant information. Provisions for unrecognized income tax benefits are reviewed regularly and are adjusted to reflect events such as the expiration of limitation periods for assessing tax, guidance given by the tax authorities and court decisions.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax basis. Deferred income taxes are measured on the enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income at the time the difference is anticipated to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized taking into account the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nDeferred income tax is provided on certain taxable temporary differences arising on investments in foreign subsidiaries, except where we intend, and are able, to reinvest such amounts on a permanent basis or to remit such amounts in a tax-free manner.\nWe have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred income tax assets and we intend to continue maintaining such valuation allowances until there is sufficient evidence to support the reduction of all or some portion of these allowances. During the year ended December 28, 2019, we determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred income tax assets in Luxembourg, the U.K., and the U.S. totaling $586.2 million were realizable.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nRecently-issued accounting pronouncements that may be relevant to our operations but have not yet been adopted are outlined in note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the financial condition and results of operations for the company for the fiscal years 2019 and 2018.

"item_7_text": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. This discussion and analysis addresses Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. For discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2019. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d above.\nOur Company\nWe are a global manufacturer of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers and to original equipment ( first-fit\u201d) manufacturers as specified components, with the majority of our revenue coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, which include construction, agriculture, energy, automotive, transportation, general industrial, consumer products and many others. We sell our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers, installers and end users as a premium brand for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built for over a century since Gates' founding in 1911. Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are often critical components in applications for which the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to normal wear and tear, resulting in a natural replacement cycle that drives high-margin, recurring revenue. Our product portfolio represents one of the broadest ranges of power transmission and fluid power products in the markets we serve, and we maintain long-standing relationships with a diversified group of blue-chip customers throughout the world. As a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered, mission-critical products, we have become an industry leader across most of the regions and end markets in which we operate.\nBusiness Trends\nOur net sales have historically been, and remain, highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement channels. This diversification limits our exposure to trends in any given end market. In addition, a majority of our sales are generated from customers in replacement channels, who serve primarily a large base of installed equipment that follows a natural maintenance cycle that is somewhat less susceptible to various trends that affect our end markets. Such trends include infrastructure investment and construction activity, agricultural production and related commodity prices, commercial and passenger vehicle production, miles driven and fleet age, evolving regulatory requirements related to emissions and fuel economy and oil and gas prices and production. Key indicators of our performance include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, sales into replacement channels accounted for approximately 63% of our total net sales. Our replacement sales cover a very broad range of applications and industries and, accordingly, are highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization and not a single end market. Replacement products are principally sold through distribution partners that may carry a very broad line of products or may specialize in products associated with a smaller set of end market applications.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, sales into first-fit channels accounted for approximately 37% of our total net sales. First-fit sales are to a variety of industrial and automotive customers. Our industrial first-fit customers cover a diverse range of industries and applications and many of our largest first-fit customers manufacture construction and agricultural equipment. Among our automotive first-fit customers, a majority of our net sales are to emerging market customers, where we believe our first-fit presence provides us with a strategic advantage in developing those markets and ultimately increasing our higher margin replacement channel sales. First-fit automotive sales in developed markets represented approximately 7% of our total net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019, with first-fit automotive sales in North America contributing less than 3% of total sales. As a result of the foregoing factors, we do not believe that our historical consolidated net sales have had any meaningful correlation to global automotive production but are positively correlated to industrial production.\nOur recently completed manufacturing footprint investments and other productivity improvements in recent years have helped to position us to continue to make progress on our restructuring program, which is primarily intended to optimize our manufacturing and distribution footprint over the mid-term by removing structural fixed costs, and, to a lesser degree, to streamline our selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) back-office functions. We anticipate that most of the costs associated with these actions will be incurred during 2020 and 2021. Some of these costs will, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, be classified in cost of sales, negatively impacting gross margin, but due to their nature and impact of hindering comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses, they will be excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, consistent with the treatment of similar costs in the current and prior years.\nResults for the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the results for the year ended December 29, 2018\nSummary Gates Performance\n\n (1) See -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income from continuing operations, the closest comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods presented.  Net sales\nNet sales during the year ended December 28, 2019 were $3,087.1 million, down by 7.8%, or $260.5 million, compared with net sales during the prior year of $3,347.6 million. Our net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019 were adversely impacted by movements in average currency exchange rates of $77.0 million compared with the prior year, due principally to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, including the Euro ($31.7 million), the Chinese Renminbi ($13.6 million), the Brazilian Real ($7.9 million) and the Canadian dollar ($6.7 million). In addition, the acquisition of Rapro in April 2018 contributed $7.5 million to our net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019. Excluding these impacts, core sales decreased by $191.0 million, or 5.7%, during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to lower volumes of $249.3 million, offset partially by a $58.3 million benefit from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions.\nCore sales in our Power Transmission and Fluid Power businesses declined by 4.6% and 7.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 28, 2019. Globally, these declines arose primarily in sales to our industrial customers, with these sales declining by $113.2 million on a core basis, compared with a $77.8 million decline in core sales to our automotive customers. Industrial first-fit and replacement sales declined by 6.9% and 6.5%, respectively, during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, driven primarily by declines in the agriculture and construction end markets in North America. Sales to the industrial end markets in Greater China and East Asia & India both were down during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, driven by a 7.9% decline in the general industrial end markets in both regions, with increasing weakness in construction equipment sales as the year has progressed. This was broadly offset by growth in sales to the industrial end markets in EMEA, with growth across all end markets except for agriculture.\nGlobal sales to the automotive end markets declined by 6.3% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, driven by sales to first-fit customers, which declined by 9.2% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. The decline in automotive end market sales was driven mostly by the broad economic softness in EMEA, with sales from this region declining by 13.6%, or $70.5 million, during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. Growth in Greater China and South America was flat, but the other regions declined by low single digits on a percentage basis as compared with the prior year.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $1,944.6 million, a decrease of 3.6%, or $72.4 million, compared with $2,017.0 million for the prior year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower volumes of $110.9 million, favorable movements in average currency exchange rates of $51.8 million, and $33.8 million of benefits from our procurement initiatives. These decreases were offset primarily by $63.2 million of a combination of wage and material inflation and $47.2 million from lower manufacturing performance driven by the lower absorption of fixed costs on lower production volumes and some excess variable costs as we continued to adjust our production costs to align with the demand outlook. In addition, cost of sales for the year ended December 28, 2019 was adversely impacted by $10.1 million of increases in tariffs and $7.0 million of higher depreciation relating primarily to the new facilities opened in 2018, compared with the prior year.\nGross profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $1,142.5 million, down 14.1% from $1,330.6 million for the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes of $138.4 million, $47.2 million of lower manufacturing performance driven by the lower absorption of fixed costs on lower production volumes, $63.2 million of unfavorable wage and material inflation, and $25.2 million of unfavorable movements in average currency exchange rates, offset by a $58.3 million benefit from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions and $33.8 million of benefits from our procurement initiatives.\nOur gross profit margin dropped by 270 basis points to 37.0% for the year ended December 28, 2019. Excluding the impact of facility closure-related inventory impairments of $1.2 million and $4.0 million of involuntary termination benefits paid in relation to permanent reductions in force, primarily in Asia and North America, gross margin was 37.2%, down from 39.7% for the prior year. In both cases, these decreases were driven by the factors described above.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $777.3 million compared with $805.8 million for the prior year. This decrease of $28.5 million was driven primarily by $17.8 million of favorable impacts from movements in average currency exchange rates and $12.1 million of net labor-related benefits which related primarily to headcount reductions and lower variable compensation, offset partially by higher stock-based compensation.\nTransaction-related expenses\nTransaction-related expenses for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $2.6 million compared with an expense of $6.7 million for the prior year. Net expenses for the year ended December 28, 2019 related primarily to exploratory merger and acquisition activity, as well as to corporate filings and transactions to provide the Company with flexibility for future raising of capital and debt, share buybacks and dividend payments. These expenses were offset partially by the release of an accrual from a prior period acquisition. The transaction-related expenses incurred in the prior year included $4.2 million related to our initial public offering and a further $0.3 million related to the extension in January 2018 of the maturity of our two revolving credit facilities. The remainder of the transaction-related expenses in the prior year related to the recent business acquisitions.\nRestructuring expenses\nWe continue to make progress on our restructuring program, which, as described further under Business Trends\u201d above, is primarily intended to optimize our manufacturing and distribution footprint over the mid-term by removing structural fixed costs, and, to a lesser degree, to streamline our SG&A back-office functions.\nRestructuring expenses of $7.2 million were recognized during the year ended December 28, 2019, including an impairment of inventory of $1.2 million due to facility closures and consolidations, which is included in cost of sales. The remainder of the expenses related primarily to severance costs, predominantly due to the closure of one of our facilities in France, a refocusing of operations in our Galesburg, Illinois facility, and a strategic restructuring of part of our Asian business. Restructuring expenses of $7.3 million were recognized during the prior year, related primarily to the implementation of our European corporate center and a strategic restructuring of part of our Asian business. Also included in restructuring expenses in the prior year was an impairment of inventory of $0.9 million, which was recognized in cost of sales.\nInterest expense\nOur interest expense was as follows:\n\nDetails of our long-term debt are presented in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nInterest on debt for the year ended December 28, 2019 decreased when compared with the equivalent prior year due primarily to the interest savings from debt repayments, in particular, the repayment of $913.7 million of senior notes in the first quarter of 2018 in conjunction with our initial public offering, in addition to margin reductions that came into effect partway during the prior year. The amortization of deferred issuance costs was lower in the year ended December 28, 2019, due to the acceleration in the prior year of $15.4 million of deferred issuance cost amortization as a consequence of the repayment of debt during the first quarter of 2018. This benefit was offset partially by the accelerated amortization of deferred issuance costs of $6.1 million during the current year, due to prepayment of our outstanding 6.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes\u201d) as part of the refinancing transactions described further in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOther (income) expenses\nOur other (income) expenses were as follows:\n\nOther income for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $9.8 million, compared with an expense of $17.4 million in the prior year. This change was driven primarily by the payment in the prior year of $27.0 million of redemption premiums on repayment of the Euro Senior Notes and partial repayment of the 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes in January and February of 2018. Partially offsetting this cost in the prior year was a $5.8 million gain on a derivative used to lock in the exchange rate used to repay the Euro Senior Notes. Higher expected returns on plan assets based on actuarial valuations drove the majority of the remaining increase in other (income) expenses during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nFor the year ended December 28, 2019, we had an income tax benefit of $495.9 million on pre-tax income of $198.8 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of (249.4%) compared with an income tax expense of $31.8 million on pre-tax income of $303.5 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 10.5% for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nOur effective tax rate for the year ended December 28, 2019 is lower than our effective tax rate for the year ended December 29, 2018 primarily due to a $579.0 million tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, partially offset by $59.7 million of tax expense from related unrecognized tax benefits, both of which resulted from the implementation of our European corporate center. Excluding these one-time impacts our 2019 effective tax rate would have been 11.8%, which is slightly higher when compared to our 2018 effective rate of 10.5%. This was driven by certain one-time tax benefits in 2018, including $37.6 million of tax benefits for manufacturing incentives, unrecognized tax benefits, and changes in valuation allowances, which were partially offset by $16.0 million of increase in tax on international operations and U.S. base erosion and anti-abuse tax. In addition, in 2019 our tax on international operations was lower by $19.9 million than in 2018, which was partially offset by an increase of $7.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities\nWe recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences arising from differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets, weighing all positive and negative evidence, and are required to establish or maintain a valuation allowance for these assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. If negative evidence exists, positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.\nOur framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires us to weigh all available evidence, including:\n \u2022 taxable income in prior carry back years if carry back is permitted under the relevant tax law; \n \u2022 future reversal of existing temporary differences; \n \u2022 tax-planning strategies that are prudent and feasible; and \n \u2022 future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.  After weighing all of the evidence, giving more weight to the evidence that was objectively verifiable, we determined in 2019 that it was more likely than not that deferred income tax assets in Luxembourg, the U.K., and the U.S. totaling $586.2 million were realizable.\nIncluded within the $586.2 million total deferred income tax assets are deferred income tax assets totaling $579.0 million related to \u20ac2.1 billion of indefinite lived net operating losses in Luxembourg for which our evaluation of the positive and negative evidence changed during the first quarter of 2019 due to the implementation of our European corporate center. Our European corporate center was implemented in 2019 to centralize and strengthen regional operations in Europe, which thereafter became centrally managed from Luxembourg.\nThe positive evidence that existed in favor of releasing the allowance as of December 28, 2019 and ultimately outweighed the negative evidence included the following:\n \u2022 our profitability in Europe in 2018 and prior years and for 2019, as well as our expectations regarding the sustainability of these profits; \n \u2022 the impact of the implementation of our European corporate center, which created an expectation of future income in Luxembourg and, thereby, removed negative evidence that supported maintaining the valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets as of December 29, 2018; and \n \u2022 the fact that our net operating loss carryforwards in Luxembourg are indefinite lived.  Further, as a result of additional financing income realized in 2019 that created taxable profits in the U.K., combined with our estimate that the financing income is likely to remain as a source of income through 2024, our judgment changed in the first quarter of 2019 regarding valuation allowances totaling $6.1 million related to indefinite lived net operating losses in the U.K.\nFinally, as a result of changes in estimates of future taxable profits in the first quarter of 2019, our judgment changed regarding the realizability of $1.1 million of U.S. foreign tax credits with related recorded valuation allowances.\nAs of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to the future realization of deferred income tax assets. We will maintain our positions with regard to future realization of deferred income tax assets, including those with respect to which we continue maintaining valuation allowances, until there is sufficient new evidence to support a change in expectations. Such a change in expectations could arise due to many factors, including those impacting our forecasts of future earnings, as well as changes in the international tax laws under which we operate and tax planning. It is not reasonably possible to forecast any such changes at the present time, but it is possible that, should they arise, our view of their effect on the future realization of deferred income tax assets may impact materially our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $611.0 million, a decrease of 19.2% or $144.8 million, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $755.8 million for the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.8% for the year ended December 28, 2019, a 280 basis point decrease from the prior year margin of 22.6%. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by reduced gross profit of $188.1 million, which was primarily the result of lower sales of $260.5 million, as well as the impact of lower fixed cost absorption on cost of sales as described above. Partially offsetting this decrease were lower SG&A expenses as noted above.\nFor a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented and the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA margin, see -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nAnalysis by Operating Segment\nPower Transmission (63.0% of Gates' net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019)\n\nNet sales in Power Transmission for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $1,945.7 million, a decrease of 7.3%, or $153.1 million, when compared with the prior year net sales of $2,098.8 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $56.5 million, core sales decreased by 4.6%, or $96.6 million, compared with the prior year. The majority of this decrease was due to lower sales volumes of $123.1 million, offset partially by benefits from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions.\nPower Transmission's core growth decline was driven by a decrease in sales to automotive first-fit customers, which decreased by 9.2% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, due primarily to weak demand in Europe and Greater China resulting from a combination of market softness, macroeconomic headwinds and continuing trade tensions. A decrease in sales to automotive replacement customers also contributed to the decline, but less significantly, with core sales lower by 3.1% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. Sales into the industrial end markets were relatively flat during the year ended December 28, 2019. General industrial end market sales declined by 3.4%, driven primarily by East Asia & India and Greater China, but this was decline was mostly offset by growth in all other regions, particularly in EMEA.\nOur Power Transmission Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $412.6 million, a decrease of 16.2% or $79.6 million, compared with the prior year Adjusted EBITDA of $492.2 million. Movements in average currency exchange rates drove $10.5 million of this decrease. Excluding this impact, the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by similar factors as described above with lower volumes of $64.7 million, $39.6 million of unfavorable wage and material inflation and lower manufacturing performance of $25.8 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were benefits from procurement initiatives of $24.7 million, benefits from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions of $26.5 million and lower SG&A spend. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 28, 2019 was 21.2%, a 230 basis point decline from the prior year Adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.5%, driven by the impacts described above.\nFluid Power (37.0% of Gates' net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019)\n\nNet sales in Fluid Power for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $1,141.4 million, a decrease of 8.6%, or $107.4 million, compared with net sales during the prior year of $1,248.8 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $20.5 million and the benefit of $7.5 million from the acquisition of Rapro in April 2018, core sales decreased by 7.6%, or $94.4 million, compared with the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to lower volumes of $126.2 million, offset partially by benefits from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions.\nThe lower core sales growth in the year ended December 28, 2019 was driven almost exclusively by a decrease in sales to industrial end markets, which declined by 8.8% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. This decrease was driven by the agriculture and construction end markets, which have continued to be challenging, declining by 18.8% and 8.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 28, 2019, compared with the prior year, primarily in North America. Fluid Power's sales to automotive end markets were flat during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, with sales in the emerging markets outperforming sales to the developed markets.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $198.4 million, a decrease of 24.7%, or $65.2 million, compared with the prior year Adjusted EBITDA of $263.6 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily lower volumes of $68.3 million, a $23.6 million adverse impact from inflation and lower manufacturing performance of $21.4 million driven by lower fixed cost absorption on lower volumes and some excess variable costs. These impacts were offset partially by a $31.8 million benefit from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions and a $10.8 million benefit from our procurement initiatives. The Adjusted EBITDA margin consequently decreased by 370 basis points.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTreasury Responsibilities and Philosophy\nOur primary liquidity and capital resource needs are for working capital, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, facility expansions and acquisitions. We expect to finance our future cash requirements with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and, where necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We have historically relied on our cash flow from operations and various debt and equity financings for liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we enter into currency derivative contracts to manage currency transaction exposures. Similarly from time to time, we may enter into interest rate derivatives to maintain the desired mix of floating and fixed rate debt.\nAs market conditions warrant, we and our majority equity holders, Blackstone and its affiliates, may from time to time, seek to repurchase securities that we have issued or loans that we have borrowed in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any such purchases may be funded by existing cash or by incurring new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may relate to a substantial amount of a particular tranche of debt, with a corresponding reduction, where relevant, in the trading liquidity of that debt. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the adjusted issue price\u201d (as", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. This discussion and analysis addresses Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. For discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2019. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d above.\nOur Company\nWe are a global manufacturer of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers and to original equipment ( first-fit\u201d) manufacturers as specified components, with the majority of our revenue coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, which include construction, agriculture, energy, automotive, transportation, general industrial, consumer products and many others. We sell our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers, installers and end users as a premium brand for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built for over a century since Gates' founding in 1911. Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are often critical components in applications for which the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to normal wear and tear, resulting in a natural replacement cycle that drives high-margin, recurring revenue. Our product portfolio represents one of the broadest ranges of power transmission and fluid power products in the markets we serve, and we maintain long-standing relationships with a diversified group of blue-chip customers throughout the world. As a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered, mission-critical products, we have become an industry leader across most of the regions and end markets in which we operate.\nBusiness Trends\nOur net sales have historically been, and remain, highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement channels. This diversification limits our exposure to trends in any given end market. In addition, a majority of our sales are generated from customers in replacement channels, who serve primarily a large base of installed equipment that follows a natural maintenance cycle that is somewhat less susceptible to various trends that affect our end markets. Such trends include infrastructure investment and construction activity, agricultural production and related commodity prices, commercial and passenger vehicle production, miles driven and fleet age, evolving regulatory requirements related to emissions and fuel economy and oil and gas prices and production. Key indicators of our performance include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, sales into replacement channels accounted for approximately 63% of our total net sales. Our replacement sales cover a very broad range of applications and industries and, accordingly, are highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization and not a single end market. Replacement products are principally sold through distribution partners that may carry a very broad line of products or may specialize in products associated with a smaller set of end market applications.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2019, sales into first-fit channels accounted for approximately 37% of our total net sales. First-fit sales are to a variety of industrial and automotive customers. Our industrial first-fit customers cover a diverse range of industries and applications and many of our largest first-fit customers manufacture construction and agricultural equipment. Among our automotive first-fit customers, a majority of our net sales are to emerging market customers, where we believe our first-fit presence provides us with a strategic advantage in developing those markets and ultimately increasing our higher margin replacement channel sales. First-fit automotive sales in developed markets represented approximately 7% of our total net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019, with first-fit automotive sales in North America contributing less than 3% of total sales. As a result of the foregoing factors, we do not believe that our historical consolidated net sales have had any meaningful correlation to global automotive production but are positively correlated to industrial production.\nOur recently completed manufacturing footprint investments and other productivity improvements in recent years have helped to position us to continue to make progress on our restructuring program, which is primarily intended to optimize our manufacturing and distribution footprint over the mid-term by removing structural fixed costs, and, to a lesser degree, to streamline our selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) back-office functions. We anticipate that most of the costs associated with these actions will be incurred during 2020 and 2021. Some of these costs will, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, be classified in cost of sales, negatively impacting gross margin, but due to their nature and impact of hindering comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses, they will be excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, consistent with the treatment of similar costs in the current and prior years.\nResults for the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the results for the year ended December 29, 2018\nSummary Gates Performance\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,087.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,347.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>1,944.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,017.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>1,142.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,330.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>777.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>805.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction-related expenses\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of intangibles and other assets\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>346.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>496.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>157.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expenses\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations before taxes\n</td> <td>198.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>(495.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>694.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>611.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>755.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) See -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income from continuing operations, the closest comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods presented.  Net sales\nNet sales during the year ended December 28, 2019 were $3,087.1 million, down by 7.8%, or $260.5 million, compared with net sales during the prior year of $3,347.6 million. Our net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019 were adversely impacted by movements in average currency exchange rates of $77.0 million compared with the prior year, due principally to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, including the Euro ($31.7 million), the Chinese Renminbi ($13.6 million), the Brazilian Real ($7.9 million) and the Canadian dollar ($6.7 million). In addition, the acquisition of Rapro in April 2018 contributed $7.5 million to our net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019. Excluding these impacts, core sales decreased by $191.0 million, or 5.7%, during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to lower volumes of $249.3 million, offset partially by a $58.3 million benefit from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions.\nCore sales in our Power Transmission and Fluid Power businesses declined by 4.6% and 7.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 28, 2019. Globally, these declines arose primarily in sales to our industrial customers, with these sales declining by $113.2 million on a core basis, compared with a $77.8 million decline in core sales to our automotive customers. Industrial first-fit and replacement sales declined by 6.9% and 6.5%, respectively, during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, driven primarily by declines in the agriculture and construction end markets in North America. Sales to the industrial end markets in Greater China and East Asia & India both were down during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, driven by a 7.9% decline in the general industrial end markets in both regions, with increasing weakness in construction equipment sales as the year has progressed. This was broadly offset by growth in sales to the industrial end markets in EMEA, with growth across all end markets except for agriculture.\nGlobal sales to the automotive end markets declined by 6.3% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, driven by sales to first-fit customers, which declined by 9.2% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. The decline in automotive end market sales was driven mostly by the broad economic softness in EMEA, with sales from this region declining by 13.6%, or $70.5 million, during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. Growth in Greater China and South America was flat, but the other regions declined by low single digits on a percentage basis as compared with the prior year.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $1,944.6 million, a decrease of 3.6%, or $72.4 million, compared with $2,017.0 million for the prior year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower volumes of $110.9 million, favorable movements in average currency exchange rates of $51.8 million, and $33.8 million of benefits from our procurement initiatives. These decreases were offset primarily by $63.2 million of a combination of wage and material inflation and $47.2 million from lower manufacturing performance driven by the lower absorption of fixed costs on lower production volumes and some excess variable costs as we continued to adjust our production costs to align with the demand outlook. In addition, cost of sales for the year ended December 28, 2019 was adversely impacted by $10.1 million of increases in tariffs and $7.0 million of higher depreciation relating primarily to the new facilities opened in 2018, compared with the prior year.\nGross profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $1,142.5 million, down 14.1% from $1,330.6 million for the prior year, driven primarily by lower volumes of $138.4 million, $47.2 million of lower manufacturing performance driven by the lower absorption of fixed costs on lower production volumes, $63.2 million of unfavorable wage and material inflation, and $25.2 million of unfavorable movements in average currency exchange rates, offset by a $58.3 million benefit from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions and $33.8 million of benefits from our procurement initiatives.\nOur gross profit margin dropped by 270 basis points to 37.0% for the year ended December 28, 2019. Excluding the impact of facility closure-related inventory impairments of $1.2 million and $4.0 million of involuntary termination benefits paid in relation to permanent reductions in force, primarily in Asia and North America, gross margin was 37.2%, down from 39.7% for the prior year. In both cases, these decreases were driven by the factors described above.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $777.3 million compared with $805.8 million for the prior year. This decrease of $28.5 million was driven primarily by $17.8 million of favorable impacts from movements in average currency exchange rates and $12.1 million of net labor-related benefits which related primarily to headcount reductions and lower variable compensation, offset partially by higher stock-based compensation.\nTransaction-related expenses\nTransaction-related expenses for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $2.6 million compared with an expense of $6.7 million for the prior year. Net expenses for the year ended December 28, 2019 related primarily to exploratory merger and acquisition activity, as well as to corporate filings and transactions to provide the Company with flexibility for future raising of capital and debt, share buybacks and dividend payments. These expenses were offset partially by the release of an accrual from a prior period acquisition. The transaction-related expenses incurred in the prior year included $4.2 million related to our initial public offering and a further $0.3 million related to the extension in January 2018 of the maturity of our two revolving credit facilities. The remainder of the transaction-related expenses in the prior year related to the recent business acquisitions.\nRestructuring expenses\nWe continue to make progress on our restructuring program, which, as described further under Business Trends\u201d above, is primarily intended to optimize our manufacturing and distribution footprint over the mid-term by removing structural fixed costs, and, to a lesser degree, to streamline our SG&A back-office functions.\nRestructuring expenses of $7.2 million were recognized during the year ended December 28, 2019, including an impairment of inventory of $1.2 million due to facility closures and consolidations, which is included in cost of sales. The remainder of the expenses related primarily to severance costs, predominantly due to the closure of one of our facilities in France, a refocusing of operations in our Galesburg, Illinois facility, and a strategic restructuring of part of our Asian business. Restructuring expenses of $7.3 million were recognized during the prior year, related primarily to the implementation of our European corporate center and a strategic restructuring of part of our Asian business. Also included in restructuring expenses in the prior year was an impairment of inventory of $0.9 million, which was recognized in cost of sales.\nInterest expense\nOur interest expense was as follows:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar Term Loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro Term Loan\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollar Senior Notes\n</td> <td>35.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro Senior Notes\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other loans\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>138.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred issuance costs\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other interest expense\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDetails of our long-term debt are presented in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nInterest on debt for the year ended December 28, 2019 decreased when compared with the equivalent prior year due primarily to the interest savings from debt repayments, in particular, the repayment of $913.7 million of senior notes in the first quarter of 2018 in conjunction with our initial public offering, in addition to margin reductions that came into effect partway during the prior year. The amortization of deferred issuance costs was lower in the year ended December 28, 2019, due to the acceleration in the prior year of $15.4 million of deferred issuance cost amortization as a consequence of the repayment of debt during the first quarter of 2018. This benefit was offset partially by the accelerated amortization of deferred issuance costs of $6.1 million during the current year, due to prepayment of our outstanding 6.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes\u201d) as part of the refinancing transactions described further in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOther (income) expenses\nOur other (income) expenses were as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on bank deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency gain on net debt and hedging instruments\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums paid on debt redemptions\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net adjustments related to post-retirement benefits\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $9.8 million, compared with an expense of $17.4 million in the prior year. This change was driven primarily by the payment in the prior year of $27.0 million of redemption premiums on repayment of the Euro Senior Notes and partial repayment of the 6.00% Dollar Senior Notes in January and February of 2018. Partially offsetting this cost in the prior year was a $5.8 million gain on a derivative used to lock in the exchange rate used to repay the Euro Senior Notes. Higher expected returns on plan assets based on actuarial valuations drove the majority of the remaining increase in other (income) expenses during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nFor the year ended December 28, 2019, we had an income tax benefit of $495.9 million on pre-tax income of $198.8 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of (249.4%) compared with an income tax expense of $31.8 million on pre-tax income of $303.5 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 10.5% for the year ended December 29, 2018.\nOur effective tax rate for the year ended December 28, 2019 is lower than our effective tax rate for the year ended December 29, 2018 primarily due to a $579.0 million tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, partially offset by $59.7 million of tax expense from related unrecognized tax benefits, both of which resulted from the implementation of our European corporate center. Excluding these one-time impacts our 2019 effective tax rate would have been 11.8%, which is slightly higher when compared to our 2018 effective rate of 10.5%. This was driven by certain one-time tax benefits in 2018, including $37.6 million of tax benefits for manufacturing incentives, unrecognized tax benefits, and changes in valuation allowances, which were partially offset by $16.0 million of increase in tax on international operations and U.S. base erosion and anti-abuse tax. In addition, in 2019 our tax on international operations was lower by $19.9 million than in 2018, which was partially offset by an increase of $7.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities\nWe recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences arising from differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets, weighing all positive and negative evidence, and are required to establish or maintain a valuation allowance for these assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. If negative evidence exists, positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.\nOur framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires us to weigh all available evidence, including:\n \u2022 taxable income in prior carry back years if carry back is permitted under the relevant tax law; \n \u2022 future reversal of existing temporary differences; \n \u2022 tax-planning strategies that are prudent and feasible; and \n \u2022 future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.  After weighing all of the evidence, giving more weight to the evidence that was objectively verifiable, we determined in 2019 that it was more likely than not that deferred income tax assets in Luxembourg, the U.K., and the U.S. totaling $586.2 million were realizable.\nIncluded within the $586.2 million total deferred income tax assets are deferred income tax assets totaling $579.0 million related to \u20ac2.1 billion of indefinite lived net operating losses in Luxembourg for which our evaluation of the positive and negative evidence changed during the first quarter of 2019 due to the implementation of our European corporate center. Our European corporate center was implemented in 2019 to centralize and strengthen regional operations in Europe, which thereafter became centrally managed from Luxembourg.\nThe positive evidence that existed in favor of releasing the allowance as of December 28, 2019 and ultimately outweighed the negative evidence included the following:\n \u2022 our profitability in Europe in 2018 and prior years and for 2019, as well as our expectations regarding the sustainability of these profits; \n \u2022 the impact of the implementation of our European corporate center, which created an expectation of future income in Luxembourg and, thereby, removed negative evidence that supported maintaining the valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets as of December 29, 2018; and \n \u2022 the fact that our net operating loss carryforwards in Luxembourg are indefinite lived.  Further, as a result of additional financing income realized in 2019 that created taxable profits in the U.K., combined with our estimate that the financing income is likely to remain as a source of income through 2024, our judgment changed in the first quarter of 2019 regarding valuation allowances totaling $6.1 million related to indefinite lived net operating losses in the U.K.\nFinally, as a result of changes in estimates of future taxable profits in the first quarter of 2019, our judgment changed regarding the realizability of $1.1 million of U.S. foreign tax credits with related recorded valuation allowances.\nAs of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to the future realization of deferred income tax assets. We will maintain our positions with regard to future realization of deferred income tax assets, including those with respect to which we continue maintaining valuation allowances, until there is sufficient new evidence to support a change in expectations. Such a change in expectations could arise due to many factors, including those impacting our forecasts of future earnings, as well as changes in the international tax laws under which we operate and tax planning. It is not reasonably possible to forecast any such changes at the present time, but it is possible that, should they arise, our view of their effect on the future realization of deferred income tax assets may impact materially our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $611.0 million, a decrease of 19.2% or $144.8 million, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $755.8 million for the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.8% for the year ended December 28, 2019, a 280 basis point decrease from the prior year margin of 22.6%. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by reduced gross profit of $188.1 million, which was primarily the result of lower sales of $260.5 million, as well as the impact of lower fixed cost absorption on cost of sales as described above. Partially offsetting this decrease were lower SG&A expenses as noted above.\nFor a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented and the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA margin, see -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nAnalysis by Operating Segment\nPower Transmission (63.0% of Gates' net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019)\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period over Period Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,945.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,098.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>492.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in Power Transmission for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $1,945.7 million, a decrease of 7.3%, or $153.1 million, when compared with the prior year net sales of $2,098.8 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $56.5 million, core sales decreased by 4.6%, or $96.6 million, compared with the prior year. The majority of this decrease was due to lower sales volumes of $123.1 million, offset partially by benefits from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions.\nPower Transmission's core growth decline was driven by a decrease in sales to automotive first-fit customers, which decreased by 9.2% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, due primarily to weak demand in Europe and Greater China resulting from a combination of market softness, macroeconomic headwinds and continuing trade tensions. A decrease in sales to automotive replacement customers also contributed to the decline, but less significantly, with core sales lower by 3.1% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. Sales into the industrial end markets were relatively flat during the year ended December 28, 2019. General industrial end market sales declined by 3.4%, driven primarily by East Asia & India and Greater China, but this was decline was mostly offset by growth in all other regions, particularly in EMEA.\nOur Power Transmission Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $412.6 million, a decrease of 16.2% or $79.6 million, compared with the prior year Adjusted EBITDA of $492.2 million. Movements in average currency exchange rates drove $10.5 million of this decrease. Excluding this impact, the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by similar factors as described above with lower volumes of $64.7 million, $39.6 million of unfavorable wage and material inflation and lower manufacturing performance of $25.8 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were benefits from procurement initiatives of $24.7 million, benefits from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions of $26.5 million and lower SG&A spend. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 28, 2019 was 21.2%, a 230 basis point decline from the prior year Adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.5%, driven by the impacts described above.\nFluid Power (37.0% of Gates' net sales for the year ended December 28, 2019)\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>December 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 29, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period over\nPeriod Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,141.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,248.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales in Fluid Power for the year ended December 28, 2019 were $1,141.4 million, a decrease of 8.6%, or $107.4 million, compared with net sales during the prior year of $1,248.8 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $20.5 million and the benefit of $7.5 million from the acquisition of Rapro in April 2018, core sales decreased by 7.6%, or $94.4 million, compared with the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to lower volumes of $126.2 million, offset partially by benefits from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions.\nThe lower core sales growth in the year ended December 28, 2019 was driven almost exclusively by a decrease in sales to industrial end markets, which declined by 8.8% during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year. This decrease was driven by the agriculture and construction end markets, which have continued to be challenging, declining by 18.8% and 8.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 28, 2019, compared with the prior year, primarily in North America. Fluid Power's sales to automotive end markets were flat during the year ended December 28, 2019 compared with the prior year, with sales in the emerging markets outperforming sales to the developed markets.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 28, 2019 was $198.4 million, a decrease of 24.7%, or $65.2 million, compared with the prior year Adjusted EBITDA of $263.6 million. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily lower volumes of $68.3 million, a $23.6 million adverse impact from inflation and lower manufacturing performance of $21.4 million driven by lower fixed cost absorption on lower volumes and some excess variable costs. These impacts were offset partially by a $31.8 million benefit from favorable, inflation-mitigating pricing actions and a $10.8 million benefit from our procurement initiatives. The Adjusted EBITDA margin consequently decreased by 370 basis points.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTreasury Responsibilities and Philosophy\nOur primary liquidity and capital resource needs are for working capital, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, facility expansions and acquisitions. We expect to finance our future cash requirements with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and, where necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We have historically relied on our cash flow from operations and various debt and equity financings for liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we enter into currency derivative contracts to manage currency transaction exposures. Similarly from time to time, we may enter into interest rate derivatives to maintain the desired mix of floating and fixed rate debt.\nAs market conditions warrant, we and our majority equity holders, Blackstone and its affiliates, may from time to time, seek to repurchase securities that we have issued or loans that we have borrowed in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any such purchases may be funded by existing cash or by incurring new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may relate to a substantial amount of a particular tranche of debt, with a corresponding reduction, where relevant, in the trading liquidity of that debt.
