Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExcept as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nThe MD&A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three years ended December 31, 2015 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOperating Highlights\nWe introduced our Un-carrier proposition in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. We believe the Un-carrier proposition has been successful as evidenced by our strong customer growth momentum since the launch of our Un-carrier proposition. Total net customer additions were 8,264,000 in 2015, broadly consistent compared to 8,334,000 in 2014 and a significant improvement compared to 4,377,000 in 2013. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we have continued to focus on retaining customers through our Un-carrier initiatives and ongoing network improvements. These initiatives have continued to provide an improved customer experience as evidenced by our strong improvement in branded postpaid phone churn of 1.39% in 2015 compared to 1.58% in 2014 and 1.69% in 2013.\nIn 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand which allows customers to lease a new wireless device and upgrade it for a new one up to three times in 12 months for no extra fee. At lease inception, devices are transferred from inventory to property and equipment. Devices are then depreciated to their estimated residual value over the lease term and revenues associated with the leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. As we do not re-lease handset devices, returned devices are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.\nFinancial Highlights\nWe generate revenues by offering affordable wireless communication services to our postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers, as well as through sales and leasing of a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Total revenues increased to $32.1 billion in 2015 compared to $29.6 billion in 2014 and $24.4 billion in 2013.\nOur most significant expenses are related to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. Operating expenses were $30.0 billion in 2015, compared to $28.1 billion in 2014 and $23.4 billion in 2013.\nNet income increased to $733 million in 2015, compared to $247 million in 2014 and $35 million in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $7.4 billion in 2015, compared to $5.6 billion in 2014 and $4.9 billion in 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Highlights\nThe ongoing success of our Un-carrier proposition and continued modernization of our network has further repositioned T-Mobile to provide customers with an exceptional customer experience, which requires substantial investment in our business.\nWe have substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to LTE, which provides our customers with the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network in the United States. In addition, we are currently in the process of building out our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. Cash capital expenditures for property and equipment, excluding payments for capitalized interest, were $4.5 billion in 2015, compared to $4.3 billion in 2014 and $4.0 billion in 2013. Payments for capitalized interest costs included in purchases of property and equipment were $246 million in 2015, $65 million in 2014 and were not significant in 2013.\nWe provide mobile communication services using spectrum licenses, consisting of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS licenses. We intend to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction in 2016, to further enhance our portfolio of U.S. nationwide broadband spectrum and enable the expansion of LTE coverage to new markets.\nSee Results of Operations\u201d below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and Performance Measures\u201d for a description of performance measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and churn. The comparability of results in this Form 10-K to the year ended 2013 is affected by the inclusion of MetroPCS results after the completion of the business combination on April 30, 2013.\nResults of

billion, or 14%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices. Additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs, and an increase in regulatory program revenues. The increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid phone average revenue per user ( ARPU\u201d). See Performance Measures\u201d for further information on branded postpaid phone ARPU.\nBranded prepaid revenues increased $567 million, or 8%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand promotional activities and continued growth in expansion markets.\nWholesale revenues decreased $39 million, or 5%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to revised agreements with certain MVNO partners in 2015, partially offset by growth in customers of certain MVNO partners.\nRoaming and other service revenues decreased $73 million, or 27%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower international roaming revenues driven by changes in contractual arrangements with certain roaming partners and a reduction in early termination fees.\nEquipment revenues decreased $71 million, or 1%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average revenue per device sold, due in part to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with JUMP! On Demand, partially offset by growth in the number of devices and accessories sold. With JUMP! On Demand, revenues associated with leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease rather than when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, equipment revenues may continue to decrease in 2016. Despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of JUMP! On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nWe financed $5.2 billion of devices through EIP during 2015, a decrease from $5.8 billion in 2014, primarily due to a decline in devices financed through EIP as customers increasingly shifted to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand.\nOther revenues increased $114 million, or 29%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher non-service revenues from revenue share agreements with third parties.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of services consists primarily of costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of equipment sales consists primarily of costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Selling, general and administrative consists of costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. These include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, loss on sale of receivables and administrative support activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of services decreased $234 million, or 4%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network and lower lease expense associated with spectrum license lease agreements. Additionally, a reduction in certain regulatory program costs contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by increases related to our network expansion and build-out of our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum.\nCost of equipment sales decreased $277 million, or 3%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average cost per device sold, mainly due to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with JUMP! On Demand, partially offset by growth in the number of devices and accessories sold. With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, cost of equipment sales may continue to decrease in 2016. Despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of JUMP! On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative increased $1.3 billion, or 15%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily to support the growing customer base, which also increased 15% in 2015, and reflects increases in employee-related costs, promotional costs, commissions, bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables primarily resulting from growth in the customer base and in the EIP program.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $276 million, or 6%, in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily driven by $312 million in depreciation expense as a result of the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program. With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is depreciated to its estimated residual value over the lease term rather than recognized as cost of\nequipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, we expect depreciation associated with leased wireless devices to continue to increase in 2016.\nCost of MetroPCS business combination of $376 million in 2015 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. On July 1, 2015, T-Mobile officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. Although we expect to incur additional network decommissioning costs in 2016 as cell site assets are removed, these costs are not expected to be significant. See Note 2 - Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nGains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $163 million in 2015 primarily consisted of a non-cash gain of $139 million from spectrum license transactions with Verizon recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with Verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the fourth quarter of 2014. See Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense increased $12 million, or 1%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher debt balances with third parties in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by a decrease from interest costs that were capitalized associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.\nInterest expense to affiliates increased $133 million, or 48%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom, partially offset by a decrease from interest costs that were capitalized associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.\nInterest income increased $61 million, or 17%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest income from devices financed through EIP. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. See Note 4 - Equipment Installment Plan Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased $79 million in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 25.1% in 2015, compared to 40.2% in 2014. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete income tax items recognized in 2015, including recent changes in state and local income tax laws and the recognition of foreign tax credits.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $486 million in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of the factors described above.\nGuarantor Subsidiaries\nPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties of T-Mobile USA, Inc. ( Issuer\u201d), excluding Senior Secured Term Loans and capital leases, is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. ( Parent\u201d) and certain of the Issuer's 100% owned subsidiaries ( Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d). Additionally, T-Mobile USA incurred $2.0 billion of Senior Secured Term Loans in 2015, which are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of T-Mobile USA's assets and the assets of T-Mobile USA's Guarantor Subsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Secured Term Loans are subject to a first priority pledge of the equity interests held by T-Mobile USA and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, T-Mobile entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis. In connection with the sales arrangement, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary to sell EIP accounts receivables ( EIP BRE\u201d), which is included in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information. See Note 3 - Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company's consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company's consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $454 million and $537 million, respectively, tower obligations of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, and stockholders' deficit of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2015 were service revenues of $1.7 billion, partially offset by costs of equipment sales of $720 million and selling, general and administrative expenses of $733 million resulting in a net comprehensive income of $60 million. In 2014, service revenues of $1.3 billion were offset by costs of equipment sales of $702 million, selling, general and administrative expenses of $518 million and other items resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $38 million. See Note 15 - Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenues\nBranded postpaid revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 9%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid customers driven by the continued success of our Un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions for services and devices. Additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs and changes in requalification requirements for corporate discount programs. The increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid average revenue per account ( ARPA\u201d). See Performance Measures\u201d for further information on ARPA. Branded postpaid ARPA was negatively impacted by continued growth of our Simple Choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans. Branded postpaid customers on Simple Choice plans increased over the past twelve months to 89% of the branded postpaid customer base as of December 31, 2014, compared to 69% as of December 31, 2013.\nBranded prepaid revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 41%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily driven by growth of the customer base from the expansion of the MetroPCS brand and an increase in promotional activities. In addition, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase.\nWholesale revenues increased $118 million, or 19%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in customer programs and monthly plans, including data, offered by our MVNO partners and changes to our MVNO contractual arrangements.\nRoaming and other service revenues decreased $78 million, or 23%, in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in early termination fees ( ETFs\u201d) following our introduction of the no annual service contract feature of the Simple Choice plan launched in March 2013.\nEquipment sales increased $1.8 billion, or 35%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. Additionally, the\ninclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The increase was partially offset by reimbursements of other carriers' ETFs and a lower average revenue per device sold.\nWe financed $5.8 billion of equipment sales revenues through EIP during 2014, an increase from $3.3 billion in 2013, resulting from growth of our Simple Choice plans. Additionally, customers had associated EIP billings of $3.6 billion in 2014, compared to $1.5 billion in 2013.\nOther revenues increased $81 million, or 25%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher co-location rental income from leasing space on wireless communication towers to third parties and higher lease income associated with spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of services increased $509 million, or 10%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013. Additionally, higher lease expense primarily relating to spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions contributed to the increase.\nCost of equipment sales increased $2.6 billion, or 38%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was partially offset by a lower average cost per device sold.\nSelling, general and administrative increased $1.5 billion, or 20%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs as a result of increases in the number of retail and customer support employees, higher commissions driven by increased gross customer additions and higher promotional costs. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 and higher stock-based compensation contributed to the increase.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $785 million, or 22%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily associated with the build-out of the T-Mobile LTE network, which increased the depreciable asset base. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013, including accelerated depreciation related to the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network, contributed to the increase.\nCost of MetroPCS business combination of $299 million in 2014 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. See Note 2 - Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. Cost of MetroPCS business combination of $108 million in 2013 reflects personnel-related costs and professional services costs associated with the business combination.\nGains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with Verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the fourth quarter of 2014. See Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nOther, net decreased $49 million, or 91%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to our 2013 restructuring program to align our operations to our new strategy and position the company for future growth. Costs associated with the 2013 restructuring program primarily consisted of severance and other personnel-related costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense increased $528 million, or 97%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily the result of higher debt balances in 2014 compared to 2013, including Senior Notes issued in 2013, the assumption of MetroPCS long-term debt in\nconnection with the business combination in April 2013, the reclassification of non-reset notes from long-term debt to affiliates to long-term debt following Deutsche Telekom's sale of the non-reset notes in October 2013, and to a lesser extent, the issuance of new senior unsecured notes in September 2014.\nInterest expense to affiliates decreased $400 million, or 59%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances with Deutsche Telekom in 2014, resulting from the recapitalization of T-Mobile prior to the business combination in April 2013 and Deutsche Telekom's sale of non-reset notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion in October 2013. To a lesser extent, additional decreases resulted from fair value adjustments related to embedded derivative instruments associated with the Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom in the recapitalization.\nInterest income increased $170 million, or 90%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was the result of significant growth in devices financed through EIP. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term.\nOther income (expense), net decreased $100 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of foreign currency translation gains in 2013 related to the retirement of derivative instruments prior to the business combination in April 2013. This decrease was offset in part by a non-cash gain recognized in 2014 on the extinguishment of $1.0 billion of 7.875% Senior Notes due in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased $150 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2014, compared to 31.4% in 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state income tax attributes, which was partially offset by an increase in federal tax credits and a reduction in the effect of Puerto Rico taxes on the effective tax rate.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $212 million in 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of the factors described above.\nGuarantor Subsidiaries\nPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. ( Parent\u201d) and certain of T-Mobile USA's ( Issuer\u201d) 100% owned subsidiaries ( Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d). In 2014, T-Mobile entered into a two-year arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis. In connection with the arrangement, the Company formed the Service BRE, which is included in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information. See Note 3 - Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company's consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company's consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2014, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $537 million, tower obligations of $2.3 billion, and stockholders' deficit of $1.5 billion. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2013, were service revenues of $823 million offset by costs of equipment sales of $552 million, resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $52 million.\nPerformance Measures\nIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate key operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry.\nTotal Customers\nA customer is generally defined as a SIM card with a unique T-Mobile identity number which is associated with an account that generates revenue. Branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones or mobile broadband devices (including tablets), where they generally pay after incurring service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. Wholesale customers include M2M and MVNO customers that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners.\nThe following table sets forth the number of ending customers:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customers, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded postpaid phone customers\n</td> <td>29,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers\n</td> <td>2,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total branded postpaid customers\n</td> <td>31,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded prepaid customers\n</td> <td>17,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total branded customers\n</td> <td>49,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale customers\n</td> <td>13,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total customers, end of period\n</td> <td>63,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth the number of net customer additions:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net customer additions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded postpaid phone customers\n</td> <td>3,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers\n</td> <td>999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total branded postpaid customers\n</td> <td>4,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded prepaid customers\n</td> <td>1,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total branded customers\n</td> <td>5,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale customers\n</td> <td>2,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net customer additions\n</td> <td>8,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired customers\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet customer additions were 8,264,000 in 2015, compared to net customer additions of 8,334,000 in 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had 63.3 million customers, a 15% increase from the customer total as of December 31, 2014, as a result of growth in the customer categories described below.\nNet customer additions were 8,334,000 in 2014, compared to 4,377,000 net customer additions, excluding customers acquired as a result of the MetroPCS business combination, in 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had 55.0 million customers, an 18% increase from the customer total as of December 31, 2013, as a result of growth in the customer categories described below.\nBranded Customers\nBranded postpaid phone net customer additions were 3,511,000 in 2015, compared to 4,047,000 in 2014. Branded postpaid phone net customer additions remained strong in 2015 driven by positive customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives, ongoing network improvements and promotional activities. Branded postpaid phone gross customer additions in 2015 were lower compared to 2014, which included the introduction of Un-carrier 4.0 Contract Freedom and certain attractive family rate\nplan promotions. Included in the branded postpaid phone net customer additions were approximately 765,000 qualified branded prepaid customers upgrading to branded postpaid plans in 2015, compared to approximately 420,000 in 2014.\nBranded postpaid phone net customer additions were 4,047,000 in 2014, compared to branded postpaid phone net customer additions of 1,938,000 in 2013. The increase in customer development was attributable to increased new customer activations and improved branded postpaid phone churn driven by the continued success of our Un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions for services and devices. Additional increases in customer development resulted from the launch of new popular devices.\nBranded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions were 999,000 in 2015, compared to 839,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher gross customer additions driven by promotions for mobile broadband devices, partially offset by higher deactivations resulting from the discontinuation of certain promotional pricing for mobile broadband services and ongoing competitive activity in the marketplace.\nBranded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions were 839,000 in 2014, compared to branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions of 68,000 in 2013. The significant increase was driven by strong customer response to promotions for mobile broadband services and devices.\nBranded prepaid net customer additions were 1,315,000 in 2015, compared to 1,244,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher gross customer additions driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand promotional activities and continued growth in expansion markets. Included in the branded prepaid net customer additions were approximately 765,000 qualified branded prepaid customers upgrading to branded postpaid plans in 2015, compared to approximately 420,000 in 2014.\nBranded prepaid net customer additions were 1,244,000 in 2014, compared to 328,000 branded prepaid net customer additions, excluding customers of MetroPCS acquired as a result of the business combination, in 2013. The increase in customer development was attributable to higher branded prepaid gross customer additions due to the growth and expansion of the MetroPCS brand, including the launch into additional markets following the MetroPCS business combination in April 2013. This increase was offset, in part, by higher deactivations from the competitive environment in the prepaid market.\nWholesale\nWholesale net customer additions were 2,439,000 in 2015, compared to 2,204,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher MVNO gross customer additions, partially offset by higher MVNO deactivations.\nWholesale net customer additions were 2,204,000 in 2014, compared to wholesale net customer additions of 2,043,000 in 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to higher M2M gross customer additions resulting from strong activation volume, partially offset by a decrease in MVNO net customer additions driven by higher churn. T-Mobile offers its M2M customers innovative products and solutions to assist them in embracing the Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d). MVNO customers continued to grow, although at a slower rate in 2014 than 2013. MVNO partners often have relationships with multiple carriers and through steering their business towards carriers offering promotions, can impact specific carriers' results.\nCustomers Per Account\nCustomers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. An account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers. We believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded postpaid customers per account\n</td> <td>2.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBranded postpaid customers per account were 2.54 as of December 31, 2015, compared to 2.36 as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by service promotions targeting families and increased penetration of mobile broadband devices.\nBranded postpaid customers per account were 2.36 as of December 31, 2014, compared to 2.18 as of December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of branded postpaid phone customers per account resulting from promotions for services, including the 4 for $100\u201d offer, and increased penetration of mobile broadband devices.\nChurn\nChurn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. The number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored. We believe that churn provides management with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded postpaid phone churn\n</td> <td>1.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded prepaid churn\n</td> <td>4.45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBranded postpaid phone churn was 1.39% in 2015, a 19 basis point improvement compared to 1.58% in 2014. The improvement in branded postpaid phone churn reflects ongoing improvements to network quality, customer service and the overall value of our offerings in the marketplace, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nBranded postpaid phone churn was 1.58% in 2014, an 11 basis point improvement compared to 1.69% in 2013. The improvement in branded postpaid phone churn was impacted by the continued success of our Un-carrier initiatives resulting in increased customer loyalty.\nBranded prepaid churn was 4.45% in 2015, compared to 4.76% in 2014. Branded prepaid churn for 2015 was impacted by a methodology change during 2015 that had no impact on our reported branded prepaid ending customers or net customer additions, but resulted in computationally lower gross customer additions and deactivations. Revision of prior periods was not practicable because certain historical data was no longer available.\nBranded prepaid churn was 4.76% in 2014, a 61 basis point improvement compared to 5.37% in 2013. The improvement was primarily due to the inclusion and growth of MetroPCS customers, which represent the largest portion of the branded prepaid customer base and historically have lower rates of churn than T-Mobile branded prepaid customers.\nAverage Revenue Per User, Average Billings Per User, Average Revenue Per Account and Average Billings Per Account\nAverage Revenue Per User ( ARPU\u201d) represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Branded postpaid phone ARPU excludes mobile broadband customers and related revenues.\nAverage Billings Per User ( ABPU\u201d) represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings, per customer. We believe branded postpaid ABPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.\nAverage Revenue Per Account ( ARPA\u201d) represents the average monthly branded postpaid service revenue earned per account. An account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers.\nAverage Billings Per Account ( ABPA\u201d) represents the average monthly branded postpaid customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and EIP billings, per account.\nTo streamline the number of key performance metrics T-Mobile discloses, we will discontinue reporting branded postpaid ARPA and ABPA after the fourth quarter of 2015. Going forward, we will continue reporting branded postpaid customers per account which may be used, along with our branded postpaid service revenues, to assess performance on a per account basis.\nThe following tables illustrate the calculation of ARPU and ABPU and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure

The decrease was primarily attributable to dilution from the continued growth of customers on Simple Choice plans and promotions targeting families. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in regulatory program revenues.\nBranded postpaid phone ARPU decreased $3.59, or 7%, for 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the continued growth of customers on Simple Choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans, and promotions for services, including the 4 for $100\u201d offer.\nBranded postpaid ABPU increased $2.04, or 3%, for 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in devices financed by customers through the EIP and JUMP! on Demand programs, partially offset by lower branded postpaid phone ARPU, as described above.\nBranded postpaid ABPU increased $2.25, or 4%, for 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to growth in devices financed through EIP, offset in part by lower branded postpaid phone ARPU.\nBranded Prepaid ARPU:\nBranded prepaid ARPU increased $0.58, or 2%, for 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the mix of branded prepaid customers choosing plans with more data, which generate a higher ARPU, partially offset by dilution from growth of customers on rate plan promotions.\nBranded prepaid ARPU increased $2.51, or 7%, for 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion and growth of the MetroPCS customer base, which generate higher ARPU than the rest of T-Mobile's branded prepaid customers.\nBranded Postpaid ARPA and Branded Postpaid ABPA:\nBranded postpaid ARPA increased $4.55, or 4%, for 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increasing number of branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers per account and an increase in regulatory program revenues, partially offset by dilution from continued growth of customers on promotions targeting families.\nBranded postpaid ARPA decreased $4.89, or 4%, for 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the continued growth of customers on Simple Choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans, and promotions for services, including the 4 for $100\u201d offer.\nBranded postpaid ABPA increased $16.95, or 12%, for 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in devices financed by customers through the EIP and JUMP! on Demand programs and an increase in branded postpaid ARPA, as described above.\nBranded postpaid ABPA increased $9.62, or 8%, for 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to growth in devices financed through EIP, offset in part by lower branded postpaid ARPA, as described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense (net of interest income), tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and expenses not reflective of T-Mobile's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is more indicative of our ongoing performance and trends by excluding certain expenses which are either nonrecurring or may not be indicative of our directly controllable operating results. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>1,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense to affiliates\n</td> <td>411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(359\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(189\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income), net\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>996\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>4,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of MetroPCS business combination\n</td> <td>376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation (1)\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(720\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net (1)\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements.

Adjusted EBITDA benefited from increased branded postpaid and prepaid revenues driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by focused cost control and synergies realized from the MetroPCS business combination, especially in cost of services. Decreased losses on equipment also contributed to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the impact of customers shifting to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand as the related costs are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term and are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. In connection with JUMP! On Demand, we had lease revenues of $224 million and depreciation expense of $312 million related to leased wireless devices in 2015. These increases were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 15% for 2014, compared to 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by increased branded postpaid revenues resulting from the continued success of our Un-carrier value proposition and strong customer response to promotional activities, as well as the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results since the business combination in 2013, including branded prepaid revenue growth from expansion of the MetroPCS brand. This increase was partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and losses on equipment sales.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of T-Mobile's financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow and reconciles Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td>(4,724\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,025\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(480\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree Cash Flow increased $861 million for 2015, compared to 2014, and $309 million for 2014, compared to 2013. The increases were primarily due to higher net cash provided by operating activities resulting from total revenue growth in excess\nof total operating expense growth, partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, common and preferred stock, the sale of certain receivables and financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms. In addition, we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Telekom that allows for up to $500 million in borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents were $4.6 billion and our short-term investments were $3.0 billion. We generated net cash provided by operating activities of $5.4 billion in 2015, compared to $4.1 billion in 2014 and $3.5 billion in 2013. As of December 31, 2015, our total debt was $26.3 billion, excluding our tower obligations as described Note 9 - Tower Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe following were the primary changes in sources of liquidity in 2015:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We issued new Senior Notes to third parties in aggregate principal amounts of $2.0 billion and incurred $2.0 billion of Senior Secured Term Loans in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We entered into master lease agreements with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital lease agreements for network equipment up to $750 million.

See Note 3 - Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe could seek additional sources of liquidity through the issuance of long-term debt in 2016 to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction in 2016. In addition to the $4.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes to third parties and Senior Secured Term Loans in 2015, we believe we have the capacity to raise an additional $6.0 billion in debt to fund such spectrum acquisitions, subject to market and other conditions, without adversely impacting our credit ratings. Excluding any additional liquidity needed to acquire spectrum, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements in the next 12 months and intend to use our principal sources of funding for general corporate purposes, including capital investments other than spectrum licenses, and enhancing our financial flexibility.\nWe determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. We regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.\nThe indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. Certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the Issuer to loan funds or make payments to the Parent. However, the Issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the Parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. We were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of December 31, 2015.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure.\nThe property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network modernization, including the build out of LTE 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. We expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion in 2016. This does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or purchases of spectrum licenses.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(9,560\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,246\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,092\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>3,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $5.4 billion in 2015, compared to $4.1 billion in 2014. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2015 primarily as a result of increased operating income from growth of branded postpaid and branded prepaid revenues partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs. Additionally, proceeds from the sale of certain EIP receivables contributed to the increase. This increase was partially offset by the timing of working capital payments and device financing through EIP and the introduction of T-Mobile's JUMP! On Demand wireless device leasing program.\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in 2014, compared to $3.5 billion in 2013. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities was driven by several factors. Our operating income, exclusive of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and gains from spectrum license transactions, increased slightly compared to the prior year. This was primarily a result of increases in branded postpaid revenues due to our acceleration of customer growth partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs and losses on equipment sales. Net changes in working capital increased slightly. This was primarily a result of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of vendor payments and proceeds from the sales of certain service receivables related to the factoring arrangement. The increases in working capital were mostly offset by increases in EIP receivables as a result of significant growth in devices financed through EIP and increases in inventories.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $9.6 billion in 2015, compared to $7.2 billion used in 2014. In 2015, cash used in investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.7 billion due primarily to the build out of our LTE network, purchases of short-term investments of $3.0 billion and purchases of intangible assets of $1.9 billion primarily due to $1.4 billion of AWS spectrum licenses acquired through the AWS auction conducted by the FCC.\nCash used in investing activities was $7.2 billion in 2014, compared to $2.1 billion used in 2013. In 2014, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.3 billion as a result of our network modernization and purchases of intangible assets of $2.9 billion due primarily to the acquisition of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. In 2013, cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $4.0 billion as a result of our network modernization. This was partially offset by cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the business combination with MetroPCS of $2.1 billion and the settlement of a short-term loan receivable, net with Deutsche Telekom of $300 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $3.4 billion in 2015, compared to $2.5 billion in 2014. In 2015, cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $4.0 billion partially offset by net repayments of short-term debt of $564 million.\nCash provided by financing activities was $2.5 billion in 2014, compared to $4.0 billion in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt of $1.0 billion, lower net proceeds from the issuance of stock of $805 million, higher net repayments of short-term debt of $174 million and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $110 million. The decrease was partially offset by higher net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $499 million.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of December 31, 2015 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>1,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations, including interest\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tower obligations (2)\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>2,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>2,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Network decommissioning (4)\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements.

Other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. In addition, because dividends on preferred stock are subject to approval by our Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred and the dividend has not been paid. See Note 14 - Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent T-Mobile's entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which T-Mobile is contractually committed. Where T-Mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, T-Mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. Additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis through November 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. In 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis through March 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2015, T-Mobile derecognized net receivables of $1.9 billion upon sale through these arrangements. See Note 3 - Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nRelated Party Transactions\nSee Note 14 - Additional Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding related party transactions.\nDisclosure of Iranian Activities under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nSection 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act\u201d). Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.\nAs of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates in 2015 that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with Deutsche Telekom. We have relied upon Deutsche Telekom for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.\nDeutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in Iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: Gostaresh Ertebatat Taliya, Irancell Telecommunications Services Company ( MTN Irancell\u201d), Telecommunication Kish Company, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Telecommunication Infrastructure Company of Iran. In 2015, gross revenues of all Deutsche Telekom affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with Iran were less than $1 million and estimated net profits were less than $1 million.\nIn addition, Deutsche Telekom, through certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective European home countries (in particular Germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the Embassy of Iran in those European countries. Gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities in 2015 were less than $0.1 million. We understand that Deutsche Telekom intends to continue these activities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results as they require the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThese policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAllowances\nWe maintain an allowance for estimated losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio. When determining the allowance, we consider a number of factors, including historical experience and current collection trends, aging of the receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions.\nCredit collection risks are assessed for each type of receivable, such as EIP receivables, based upon historical and expected write-offs, net of recoveries, and an analysis of the aged accounts receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the\nreceivable ages. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the required allowance amounts could differ from the estimate. We write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.\nWe offer certain retail customers the option to pay for devices and other accessories in installments using an EIP. At the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the EIP receivables and record the EIP receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. The difference between the present value of the EIP receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenues. We determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the amount of expected credit losses on the EIP receivables. As a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. The imputed discount on EIP receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as interest income in Other income (expense), net.\nSubsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross EIP receivables exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances.\nTotal imputed discount and allowances as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately 8.2% and 7.4%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including EIP receivables.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation commences once assets have been placed in service and is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset. Leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to T-Mobile, which is generally the lease term. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and expected loss of leased wireless devices. When these factors indicate that an asset's useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 - Property and Equipment of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management's underlying estimates of useful lives.\nEvaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment\nWe assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (spectrum licenses) for potential impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.\nWe may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two-step test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value. Prior to the business combination, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach due to the absence of comparable observable market data. The discounted cash flow method utilizes future cash flow assumptions based on estimates of revenues, EBITDA margin and a long-term growth rate taking into consideration expected industry and market conditions. The cash flows are then discounted using a weighted average cost of capital reflecting the risks associated with the business and the projected cash flows. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step of the test is performed.\nIn the second step, we determine the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that currently may not be recorded. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\nWe test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is less than its carrying value. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. If the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. We estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the Greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The Greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.\nThe valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. If actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. The most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, EBITDA margins and the long-term growth rate. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.\nGuarantee Liabilities\nIn 2013, we introduced a handset upgrade program, JUMP!, which provides enrolled customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. Participating customers must purchase a device from us, have a qualifying monthly wireless service plan with us, and finance their handset using our EIP, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. Upon qualifying JUMP! program upgrades, the customers' remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new handset from us on a new EIP.\nFor customers who enroll in the trade-in program, we defer a portion of revenue which represents the estimated value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. The guarantee liabilities are valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which require judgment, including the customer's estimated remaining EIP balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and probability and timing of trade-in. When the customer upgrades their device, the difference between the trade-in credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned handset is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. All assumptions are reviewed periodically.\nRent Expense\nMost of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception or significant modification, to be reasonably assured. We make significant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a penalty.\u201d In doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. A valuation allowance\nis maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. We consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.", "summary": "The report is a Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of T-Mobile US, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations.

"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExcept as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nThe MD&A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three years ended December 31, 2015 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOperating Highlights\nWe introduced our Un-carrier proposition in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. We believe the Un-carrier proposition has been successful as evidenced by our strong customer growth momentum since the launch of our Un-carrier proposition. Total net customer additions were 8,264,000 in 2015, broadly consistent compared to 8,334,000 in 2014 and a significant improvement compared to 4,377,000 in 2013. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we have continued to focus on retaining customers through our Un-carrier initiatives and ongoing network improvements. These initiatives have continued to provide an improved customer experience as evidenced by our strong improvement in branded postpaid phone churn of 1.39% in 2015 compared to 1.58% in 2014 and 1.69% in 2013.\nIn 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand which allows customers to lease a new wireless device and upgrade it for a new one up to three times in 12 months for no extra fee. At lease inception, devices are transferred from inventory to property and equipment. Devices are then depreciated to their estimated residual value over the lease term and revenues associated with the leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. As we do not re-lease handset devices, returned devices are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.\nFinancial Highlights\nWe generate revenues by offering affordable wireless communication services to our postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers, as well as through sales and leasing of a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Total revenues increased to $32.1 billion in 2015 compared to $29.6 billion in 2014 and $24.4 billion in 2013.\nOur most significant expenses are related to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. Operating expenses were $30.0 billion in 2015, compared to $28.1 billion in 2014 and $23.4 billion in 2013.\nNet income increased to $733 million in 2015, compared to $247 million in 2014 and $35 million in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $7.4 billion in 2015, compared to $5.6 billion in 2014 and $4.9 billion in 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Highlights\nThe ongoing success of our Un-carrier proposition and continued modernization of our network has further repositioned T-Mobile to provide customers with an exceptional customer experience, which requires substantial investment in our business.\nWe have substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to LTE, which provides our customers with the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network in the United States. In addition, we are currently in the process of building out our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. Cash capital expenditures for property and equipment, excluding payments for capitalized interest, were $4.5 billion in 2015, compared to $4.3 billion in 2014 and $4.0 billion in 2013. Payments for capitalized interest costs included in purchases of property and equipment were $246 million in 2015, $65 million in 2014 and were not significant in 2013.\nWe provide mobile communication services using spectrum licenses, consisting of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS licenses. We intend to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction in 2016, to further enhance our portfolio of U.S. nationwide broadband spectrum and enable the expansion of LTE coverage to new markets.\nSee Results of Operations\u201d below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and Performance Measures\u201d for a description of performance measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and churn. The comparability of results in this Form 10-K to the year ended 2013 is affected by the inclusion of MetroPCS results after the completion of the business combination on April 30, 2013.\nResults of Operations\nSet forth below is a summary of consolidated results:\n\nNM - Not Meaningful\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nBranded postpaid revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 14%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices. Additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs, and an increase in regulatory program revenues. The increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid phone average revenue per user ( ARPU\u201d). See Performance Measures\u201d for further information on branded postpaid phone ARPU.\nBranded prepaid revenues increased $567 million, or 8%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand promotional activities and continued growth in expansion markets.\nWholesale revenues decreased $39 million, or 5%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to revised agreements with certain MVNO partners in 2015, partially offset by growth in customers of certain MVNO partners.\nRoaming and other service revenues decreased $73 million, or 27%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower international roaming revenues driven by changes in contractual arrangements with certain roaming partners and a reduction in early termination fees.\nEquipment revenues decreased $71 million, or 1%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average revenue per device sold, due in part to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with JUMP! On Demand, partially offset by growth in the number of devices and accessories sold. With JUMP! On Demand, revenues associated with leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease rather than when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, equipment revenues may continue to decrease in 2016. Despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of JUMP! On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nWe financed $5.2 billion of devices through EIP during 2015, a decrease from $5.8 billion in 2014, primarily due to a decline in devices financed through EIP as customers increasingly shifted to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand.\nOther revenues increased $114 million, or 29%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher non-service revenues from revenue share agreements with third parties.\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 Cost of services consists primarily of costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs. \n \u2022 Cost of equipment sales consists primarily of costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs. \n \u2022 Selling, general and administrative consists of costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. These include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, loss on sale of receivables and administrative support activities. \nCost of services decreased $234 million, or 4%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network and lower lease expense associated with spectrum license lease agreements. Additionally, a reduction in certain regulatory program costs contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by increases related to our network expansion and build-out of our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum.\nCost of equipment sales decreased $277 million, or 3%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average cost per device sold, mainly due to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with JUMP! On Demand, partially offset by growth in the number of devices and accessories sold. With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, cost of equipment sales may continue to decrease in 2016. Despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of JUMP! On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative increased $1.3 billion, or 15%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily to support the growing customer base, which also increased 15% in 2015, and reflects increases in employee-related costs, promotional costs, commissions, bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables primarily resulting from growth in the customer base and in the EIP program.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $276 million, or 6%, in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily driven by $312 million in depreciation expense as a result of the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program. With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is depreciated to its estimated residual value over the lease term rather than recognized as cost of\nequipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, we expect depreciation associated with leased wireless devices to continue to increase in 2016.\nCost of MetroPCS business combination of $376 million in 2015 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. On July 1, 2015, T-Mobile officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. Although we expect to incur additional network decommissioning costs in 2016 as cell site assets are removed, these costs are not expected to be significant. See Note 2 - Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nGains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $163 million in 2015 primarily consisted of a non-cash gain of $139 million from spectrum license transactions with Verizon recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with Verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the fourth quarter of 2014. See Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense increased $12 million, or 1%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher debt balances with third parties in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by a decrease from interest costs that were capitalized associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.\nInterest expense to affiliates increased $133 million, or 48%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom, partially offset by a decrease from interest costs that were capitalized associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.\nInterest income increased $61 million, or 17%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest income from devices financed through EIP. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. See Note 4 - Equipment Installment Plan Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased $79 million in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 25.1% in 2015, compared to 40.2% in 2014. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete income tax items recognized in 2015, including recent changes in state and local income tax laws and the recognition of foreign tax credits.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $486 million in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of the factors described above.\nGuarantor Subsidiaries\nPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties of T-Mobile USA, Inc. ( Issuer\u201d), excluding Senior Secured Term Loans and capital leases, is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. ( Parent\u201d) and certain of the Issuer's 100% owned subsidiaries ( Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d). Additionally, T-Mobile USA incurred $2.0 billion of Senior Secured Term Loans in 2015, which are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of T-Mobile USA's assets and the assets of T-Mobile USA's Guarantor Subsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Secured Term Loans are subject to a first priority pledge of the equity interests held by T-Mobile USA and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, T-Mobile entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis. In connection with the sales arrangement, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary to sell EIP accounts receivables ( EIP BRE\u201d), which is included in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information. See Note 3 - Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company's consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company's consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $454 million and $537 million, respectively, tower obligations of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, and stockholders' deficit of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2015 were service revenues of $1.7 billion, partially offset by costs of equipment sales of $720 million and selling, general and administrative expenses of $733 million resulting in a net comprehensive income of $60 million. In 2014, service revenues of $1.3 billion were offset by costs of equipment sales of $702 million, selling, general and administrative expenses of $518 million and other items resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $38 million. See Note 15 - Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenues\nBranded postpaid revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 9%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid customers driven by the continued success of our Un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions for services and devices. Additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs and changes in requalification requirements for corporate discount programs. The increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid average revenue per account ( ARPA\u201d). See Performance Measures\u201d for further information on ARPA. Branded postpaid ARPA was negatively impacted by continued growth of our Simple Choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans. Branded postpaid customers on Simple Choice plans increased over the past twelve months to 89% of the branded postpaid customer base as of December 31, 2014, compared to 69% as of December 31, 2013.\nBranded prepaid revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 41%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily driven by growth of the customer base from the expansion of the MetroPCS brand and an increase in promotional activities. In addition, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase.\nWholesale revenues increased $118 million, or 19%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in customer programs and monthly plans, including data, offered by our MVNO partners and changes to our MVNO contractual arrangements.\nRoaming and other service revenues decreased $78 million, or 23%, in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in early termination fees ( ETFs\u201d) following our introduction of the no annual service contract feature of the Simple Choice plan launched in March 2013.\nEquipment sales increased $1.8 billion, or 35%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. Additionally, the\ninclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The increase was partially offset by reimbursements of other carriers' ETFs and a lower average revenue per device sold.\nWe financed $5.8 billion of equipment sales revenues through EIP during 2014, an increase from $3.3 billion in 2013, resulting from growth of our Simple Choice plans. Additionally, customers had associated EIP billings of $3.6 billion in 2014, compared to $1.5 billion in 2013.\nOther revenues increased $81 million, or 25%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher co-location rental income from leasing space on wireless communication towers to third parties and higher lease income associated with spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of services increased $509 million, or 10%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013. Additionally, higher lease expense primarily relating to spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions contributed to the increase.\nCost of equipment sales increased $2.6 billion, or 38%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was partially offset by a lower average cost per device sold.\nSelling, general and administrative increased $1.5 billion, or 20%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs as a result of increases in the number of retail and customer support employees, higher commissions driven by increased gross customer additions and higher promotional costs. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 and higher stock-based compensation contributed to the increase.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $785 million, or 22%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily associated with the build-out of the T-Mobile LTE network, which increased the depreciable asset base. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013, including accelerated depreciation related to the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network, contributed to the increase.\nCost of MetroPCS business combination of $299 million in 2014 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. See Note 2 - Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. Cost of MetroPCS business combination of $108 million in 2013 reflects personnel-related costs and professional services costs associated with the business combination.\nGains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with Verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the fourth quarter of 2014. See Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nOther, net decreased $49 million, or 91%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to our 2013 restructuring program to align our operations to our new strategy and position the company for future growth. Costs associated with the 2013 restructuring program primarily consisted of severance and other personnel-related costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense increased $528 million, or 97%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily the result of higher debt balances in 2014 compared to 2013, including Senior Notes issued in 2013, the assumption of MetroPCS long-term debt in\nconnection with the business combination in April 2013, the reclassification of non-reset notes from long-term debt to affiliates to long-term debt following Deutsche Telekom's sale of the non-reset notes in October 2013, and to a lesser extent, the issuance of new senior unsecured notes in September 2014.\nInterest expense to affiliates decreased $400 million, or 59%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances with Deutsche Telekom in 2014, resulting from the recapitalization of T-Mobile prior to the business combination in April 2013 and Deutsche Telekom's sale of non-reset notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion in October 2013. To a lesser extent, additional decreases resulted from fair value adjustments related to embedded derivative instruments associated with the Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom in the recapitalization.\nInterest income increased $170 million, or 90%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was the result of significant growth in devices financed through EIP. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term.\nOther income (expense), net decreased $100 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of foreign currency translation gains in 2013 related to the retirement of derivative instruments prior to the business combination in April 2013. This decrease was offset in part by a non-cash gain recognized in 2014 on the extinguishment of $1.0 billion of 7.875% Senior Notes due in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased $150 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2014, compared to 31.4% in 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state income tax attributes, which was partially offset by an increase in federal tax credits and a reduction in the effect of Puerto Rico taxes on the effective tax rate.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $212 million in 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of the factors described above.\nGuarantor Subsidiaries\nPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. ( Parent\u201d) and certain of T-Mobile USA's ( Issuer\u201d) 100% owned subsidiaries ( Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d). In 2014, T-Mobile entered into a two-year arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis. In connection with the arrangement, the Company formed the Service BRE, which is included in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information. See Note 3 - Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company's consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company's consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2014, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $537 million, tower obligations of $2.3 billion, and stockholders' deficit of $1.5 billion. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2013, were service revenues of $823 million offset by costs of equipment sales of $552 million, resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $52 million.\nPerformance Measures\nIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures. These operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. Although", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExcept as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) are those of T-Mobile US, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nThe MD&A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three years ended December 31, 2015 included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOperating Highlights\nWe introduced our Un-carrier proposition in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. We believe the Un-carrier proposition has been successful as evidenced by our strong customer growth momentum since the launch of our Un-carrier proposition. Total net customer additions were 8,264,000 in 2015, broadly consistent compared to 8,334,000 in 2014 and a significant improvement compared to 4,377,000 in 2013. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we have continued to focus on retaining customers through our Un-carrier initiatives and ongoing network improvements. These initiatives have continued to provide an improved customer experience as evidenced by our strong improvement in branded postpaid phone churn of 1.39% in 2015 compared to 1.58% in 2014 and 1.69% in 2013.\nIn 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand which allows customers to lease a new wireless device and upgrade it for a new one up to three times in 12 months for no extra fee. At lease inception, devices are transferred from inventory to property and equipment. Devices are then depreciated to their estimated residual value over the lease term and revenues associated with the leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. As we do not re-lease handset devices, returned devices are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.\nFinancial Highlights\nWe generate revenues by offering affordable wireless communication services to our postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers, as well as through sales and leasing of a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Total revenues increased to $32.1 billion in 2015 compared to $29.6 billion in 2014 and $24.4 billion in 2013.\nOur most significant expenses are related to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. Operating expenses were $30.0 billion in 2015, compared to $28.1 billion in 2014 and $23.4 billion in 2013.\nNet income increased to $733 million in 2015, compared to $247 million in 2014 and $35 million in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $7.4 billion in 2015, compared to $5.6 billion in 2014 and $4.9 billion in 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Highlights\nThe ongoing success of our Un-carrier proposition and continued modernization of our network has further repositioned T-Mobile to provide customers with an exceptional customer experience, which requires substantial investment in our business.\nWe have substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to LTE, which provides our customers with the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network in the United States. In addition, we are currently in the process of building out our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses. Cash capital expenditures for property and equipment, excluding payments for capitalized interest, were $4.5 billion in 2015, compared to $4.3 billion in 2014 and $4.0 billion in 2013. Payments for capitalized interest costs included in purchases of property and equipment were $246 million in 2015, $65 million in 2014 and were not significant in 2013.\nWe provide mobile communication services using spectrum licenses, consisting of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS licenses. We intend to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction in 2016, to further enhance our portfolio of U.S. nationwide broadband spectrum and enable the expansion of LTE coverage to new markets.\nSee Results of Operations\u201d below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and Performance Measures\u201d for a description of performance measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and churn. The comparability of results in this Form 10-K to the year ended 2013 is affected by the inclusion of MetroPCS results after the completion of the business combination on April 30, 2013.\nResults of

billion, or 14%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices. Additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs, and an increase in regulatory program revenues. The increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid phone average revenue per user ( ARPU\u201d). See Performance Measures\u201d for further information on branded postpaid phone ARPU.\nBranded prepaid revenues increased $567 million, or 8%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our MetroPCS brand promotional activities and continued growth in expansion markets.\nWholesale revenues decreased $39 million, or 5%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to revised agreements with certain MVNO partners in 2015, partially offset by growth in customers of certain MVNO partners.\nRoaming and other service revenues decreased $73 million, or 27%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower international roaming revenues driven by changes in contractual arrangements with certain roaming partners and a reduction in early termination fees.\nEquipment revenues decreased $71 million, or 1%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average revenue per device sold, due in part to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with JUMP! On Demand, partially offset by growth in the number of devices and accessories sold. With JUMP! On Demand, revenues associated with leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease rather than when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, equipment revenues may continue to decrease in 2016. Despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of JUMP! On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nWe financed $5.2 billion of devices through EIP during 2015, a decrease from $5.8 billion in 2014, primarily due to a decline in devices financed through EIP as customers increasingly shifted to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand.\nOther revenues increased $114 million, or 29%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher non-service revenues from revenue share agreements with third parties.\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 Cost of services consists primarily of costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs. \n \u2022 Cost of equipment sales consists primarily of costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs. \n \u2022 Selling, general and administrative consists of costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. These include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, loss on sale of receivables and administrative support activities. \nCost of services decreased $234 million, or 4%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network and lower lease expense associated with spectrum license lease agreements. Additionally, a reduction in certain regulatory program costs contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by increases related to our network expansion and build-out of our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum.\nCost of equipment sales decreased $277 million, or 3%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average cost per device sold, mainly due to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with JUMP! On Demand, partially offset by growth in the number of devices and accessories sold. With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, cost of equipment sales may continue to decrease in 2016. Despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of JUMP! On Demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative increased $1.3 billion, or 15%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily to support the growing customer base, which also increased 15% in 2015, and reflects increases in employee-related costs, promotional costs, commissions, bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables primarily resulting from growth in the customer base and in the EIP program.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $276 million, or 6%, in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily driven by $312 million in depreciation expense as a result of the launch of our JUMP! On Demand program. With JUMP! On Demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is depreciated to its estimated residual value over the lease term rather than recognized as cost of\nequipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. If customers continue to shift to leasing devices with JUMP! On Demand, we expect depreciation associated with leased wireless devices to continue to increase in 2016.\nCost of MetroPCS business combination of $376 million in 2015 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. On July 1, 2015, T-Mobile officially completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS CDMA network. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. Although we expect to incur additional network decommissioning costs in 2016 as cell site assets are removed, these costs are not expected to be significant. See Note 2 - Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nGains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $163 million in 2015 primarily consisted of a non-cash gain of $139 million from spectrum license transactions with Verizon recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with Verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the fourth quarter of 2014. See Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense increased $12 million, or 1%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher debt balances with third parties in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by a decrease from interest costs that were capitalized associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.\nInterest expense to affiliates increased $133 million, or 48%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom, partially offset by a decrease from interest costs that were capitalized associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses.\nInterest income increased $61 million, or 17%, in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest income from devices financed through EIP. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. See Note 4 - Equipment Installment Plan Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased $79 million in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 25.1% in 2015, compared to 40.2% in 2014. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete income tax items recognized in 2015, including recent changes in state and local income tax laws and the recognition of foreign tax credits.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $486 million in 2015, compared to 2014, as a result of the factors described above.\nGuarantor Subsidiaries\nPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties of T-Mobile USA, Inc. ( Issuer\u201d), excluding Senior Secured Term Loans and capital leases, is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. ( Parent\u201d) and certain of the Issuer's 100% owned subsidiaries ( Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d). Additionally, T-Mobile USA incurred $2.0 billion of Senior Secured Term Loans in 2015, which are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of T-Mobile USA's assets and the assets of T-Mobile USA's Guarantor Subsidiaries. In addition, the Senior Secured Term Loans are subject to a first priority pledge of the equity interests held by T-Mobile USA and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, T-Mobile entered into an arrangement to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis. In connection with the sales arrangement, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary to sell EIP accounts receivables ( EIP BRE\u201d), which is included in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information. See Note 3 - Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company's consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company's consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $454 million and $537 million, respectively, tower obligations of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, and stockholders' deficit of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2015 were service revenues of $1.7 billion, partially offset by costs of equipment sales of $720 million and selling, general and administrative expenses of $733 million resulting in a net comprehensive income of $60 million. In 2014, service revenues of $1.3 billion were offset by costs of equipment sales of $702 million, selling, general and administrative expenses of $518 million and other items resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $38 million. See Note 15 - Guarantor Financial Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenues\nBranded postpaid revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 9%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid customers driven by the continued success of our Un-carrier proposition and strong customer response to promotions for services and devices. Additional increases resulted from customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs and changes in requalification requirements for corporate discount programs. The increase was partially offset by lower branded postpaid average revenue per account ( ARPA\u201d). See Performance Measures\u201d for further information on ARPA. Branded postpaid ARPA was negatively impacted by continued growth of our Simple Choice plans, which have lower monthly service charges compared to traditional bundled plans. Branded postpaid customers on Simple Choice plans increased over the past twelve months to 89% of the branded postpaid customer base as of December 31, 2014, compared to 69% as of December 31, 2013.\nBranded prepaid revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 41%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily driven by growth of the customer base from the expansion of the MetroPCS brand and an increase in promotional activities. In addition, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase.\nWholesale revenues increased $118 million, or 19%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in customer programs and monthly plans, including data, offered by our MVNO partners and changes to our MVNO contractual arrangements.\nRoaming and other service revenues decreased $78 million, or 23%, in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in early termination fees ( ETFs\u201d) following our introduction of the no annual service contract feature of the Simple Choice plan launched in March 2013.\nEquipment sales increased $1.8 billion, or 35%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. Additionally, the\ninclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The increase was partially offset by reimbursements of other carriers' ETFs and a lower average revenue per device sold.\nWe financed $5.8 billion of equipment sales revenues through EIP during 2014, an increase from $3.3 billion in 2013, resulting from growth of our Simple Choice plans. Additionally, customers had associated EIP billings of $3.6 billion in 2014, compared to $1.5 billion in 2013.\nOther revenues increased $81 million, or 25%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher co-location rental income from leasing space on wireless communication towers to third parties and higher lease income associated with spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of services increased $509 million, or 10%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013. Additionally, higher lease expense primarily relating to spectrum license lease agreements resulting from spectrum swap transactions contributed to the increase.\nCost of equipment sales increased $2.6 billion, or 38%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the number of devices sold due to higher gross customer additions and higher device upgrade volumes, including JUMP! redemptions. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 contributed to the increase. The volume of device sales increased 48% in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was partially offset by a lower average cost per device sold.\nSelling, general and administrative increased $1.5 billion, or 20%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs as a result of increases in the number of retail and customer support employees, higher commissions driven by increased gross customer additions and higher promotional costs. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013 and higher stock-based compensation contributed to the increase.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $785 million, or 22%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily associated with the build-out of the T-Mobile LTE network, which increased the depreciable asset base. Additionally, the inclusion of MetroPCS operating results for the full year period in 2014 following the business combination in April 2013, including accelerated depreciation related to the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network, contributed to the increase.\nCost of MetroPCS business combination of $299 million in 2014 primarily reflects network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. In 2014, we began decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites. Network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. See Note 2 - Business Combination with MetroPCS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. Cost of MetroPCS business combination of $108 million in 2013 reflects personnel-related costs and professional services costs associated with the business combination.\nGains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $840 million in 2014 primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with Verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with AT&T during the fourth quarter of 2014. See Note 6 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nOther, net decreased $49 million, or 91%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to our 2013 restructuring program to align our operations to our new strategy and position the company for future growth. Costs associated with the 2013 restructuring program primarily consisted of severance and other personnel-related costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense increased $528 million, or 97%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily the result of higher debt balances in 2014 compared to 2013, including Senior Notes issued in 2013, the assumption of MetroPCS long-term debt in\nconnection with the business combination in April 2013, the reclassification of non-reset notes from long-term debt to affiliates to long-term debt following Deutsche Telekom's sale of the non-reset notes in October 2013, and to a lesser extent, the issuance of new senior unsecured notes in September 2014.\nInterest expense to affiliates decreased $400 million, or 59%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances with Deutsche Telekom in 2014, resulting from the recapitalization of T-Mobile prior to the business combination in April 2013 and Deutsche Telekom's sale of non-reset notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion in October 2013. To a lesser extent, additional decreases resulted from fair value adjustments related to embedded derivative instruments associated with the Senior Reset Notes issued to Deutsche Telekom in the recapitalization.\nInterest income increased $170 million, or 90%, in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was the result of significant growth in devices financed through EIP. Interest associated with EIP receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term.\nOther income (expense), net decreased $100 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of foreign currency translation gains in 2013 related to the retirement of derivative instruments prior to the business combination in April 2013. This decrease was offset in part by a non-cash gain recognized in 2014 on the extinguishment of $1.0 billion of 7.875% Senior Notes due in 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense increased $150 million in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2014, compared to 31.4% in 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state income tax attributes, which was partially offset by an increase in federal tax credits and a reduction in the effect of Puerto Rico taxes on the effective tax rate.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $212 million in 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of the factors described above.\nGuarantor Subsidiaries\nPursuant to the indenture and the supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. ( Parent\u201d) and certain of T-Mobile USA's ( Issuer\u201d) 100% owned subsidiaries ( Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d). In 2014, T-Mobile entered into a two-year arrangement to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis. In connection with the arrangement, the Company formed the Service BRE, which is included in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries condensed consolidating financial information. See Note 3 - Sales of Certain Receivables of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe financial condition of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries is substantially similar to the Company's consolidated financial condition. Similarly, the results of operations of the Parent, Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiaries are substantially similar to the Company's consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2014, the most significant components of the financial condition of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were property and equipment of $537 million, tower obligations of $2.3 billion, and stockholders' deficit of $1.5 billion. The most significant components of the results of operations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in 2013, were service revenues of $823 million offset by costs of equipment sales of $552 million, resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $52 million.\nPerformance Measures\nIn managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-GAAP financial measures.
