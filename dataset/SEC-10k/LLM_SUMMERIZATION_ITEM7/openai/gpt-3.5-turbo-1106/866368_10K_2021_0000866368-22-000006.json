MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP.\u201d) The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nWe continually evaluate the estimates, judgments, and assumptions we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Changes in estimates, judgments, or assumptions could affect our financial position and our results of operations, which are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance.\nCritical Accounting Estimates:\nOur critical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with GAAP, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting estimates are described below.\nRecognition of real estate acquired: Generally, our acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate are accounted for as asset acquisitions and not business combinations because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). The accounting model for asset acquisitions requires that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. We estimate the fair value of land, buildings, intangible assets, and intangible liabilities for purposes of allocating purchase price.\nSuch estimates, which are determined with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists where appropriate, are based upon many assumptions and judgments, including, but not limited to:\n\uf0b7market rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate and intangible assets;\n\uf0b7building and material cost levels;\n\uf0b7estimated market rent levels;\n\uf0b7future revenue growth rates;\n\uf0b7future cash flows from the real estate and the existing customer base, and\n\uf0b7comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land transactions.\nIn calculating value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2021, we used discount rates ranging from 5.5% and 6.0% and a capitalization rate of 5.0%. Others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which could result in different depreciation and amortization expense, rental income, gains, and losses on sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible assets.\nWe completed acquisitions of two properties for a total purchase price of $148.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed. Refer to the Acquisitions\u201d section of Note 3 - Real estate facilities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\u200e\nImpairment of long-lived assets: For each reporting period, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets, including our rental properties, construction in progress, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee, and intangibles, to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. If triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.\nUpon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the asset is expected to be held and used. We may also adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.\nImpairment of real estate assets classified as held for sale: A property is classified as held for sale when all of the accounting criteria for a plan of sale have been met. Upon classification as held for sale, we recognize an impairment charge, if necessary, to lower the carrying amount of the real estate asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. The determination of fair value can involve significant judgments and assumptions. We develop key assumptions based on the following available factors: (i) contractual sales price, (ii) preliminary non-binding letters of intent, or (iii) other available comparable market information. If this information is not available, we use estimated replacement costs or estimated cash flow projections that utilize estimated discount and capitalization rates. These estimates are subject to uncertainty and therefore require significant judgment by us. We review all assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. Subsequently, as a result of our quarterly assessment, we may recognize an incremental impairment charge for any decrease in the asset's fair value less cost to sell. Conversely, we may recognize a gain for a subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, limited to the cumulative net loss previously recognized.\nThe analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets involves identification of indicators of impairment, projections of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair values or selling prices, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity. Others could come to materially different conclusions. In addition, we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment. Any unidentified impairment loss, or change in conclusions, could have a material adverse impact on our net income.\nThe evaluation for impairment and calculation of the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used involves consideration of factors and calculations that are different than the estimate of fair value of assets classified as held for sale. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.\n\u200e\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company is a fully-integrated, self-advised and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, acquires, and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex and low-rise suburban office space. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned and operated 27.7 million rentable square feet of commercial space in six states consisting of 97 parks and 666 buildings. The Company's properties are primarily located in major coastal markets that have experienced long-term economic growth. The Company also held a 95.0% interest in a joint venture entity which owns Highgate at The Mile, a 395-unit multifamily apartment complex located in Tysons, Virginia, and a 98.2% interest in a joint venture formed to develop Brentford at The Mile, a planned 411-unit multifamily apartment complex also located in Tysons, Virginia. Our strong and conservative capital structure allows us the flexibility to use debt and equity capital prudently to fund our growth, which allows us to acquire properties we believe will create long-term value. From time to time we sell properties which no longer fit the Company's strategic objectives.\nExisting Real Estate Facilities: The operating results of our existing real estate facilities are substantially influenced by demand for rental space within our properties and our markets, which impacts occupancy, rental rates, and capital expenditure requirements. We strive to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates and minimizing capital expenditures when market conditions allow, although the Company may decrease rental rates in markets where conditions require. Management's initiatives and strategies with respect to our existing real estate facilities, which include incentivizing our personnel to maximize the return on investment for each lease transaction and provide a superior level of service to our customers.\nAcquisitions of Real Estate Facilities: We seek to grow our portfolio through acquisitions of facilities generally consistent with the Company's focus on owning concentrated business parks with easy to configure space and in markets and product types with favorable long-term return potential.\nOn November 18, 2021, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 141,000 rentable square feet in Plano, Texas, for a total purchase price of $25.6 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of 5 buildings and was 97.3% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,400 to 25,000 square feet.\nOn September 1, 2021, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 718,000 rentable square feet in Grapevine, Texas, for a total purchase price of $123.3 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of 15 buildings and was 96.1% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 2,000 to 20,000 square feet.\nOn October 28, 2020, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 246,000 rentable square feet in Alexandria, Virginia, for a total purchase price of $46.6 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of three buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 7,000 to 75,000 square feet.\nOn January 10, 2020, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 73,000 rentable square feet in La Mirada, California, for a total purchase price of $13.5 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of five buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,200 to 3,000 square feet.\nOn December 20, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial-flex business park comprising approximately 79,000 rentable square feet in Santa Clara, California, for a total purchase price of $16.8 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of nine buildings and was 95.6% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 200 to 3,500 square feet.\nOn September 5, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 543,000 rentable square feet in Santa Fe Springs, California, for a total purchase price of $104.3 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of ten buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 5,000 to 288,000 square feet.\nOn April 18, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 74,000 rentable square feet in Signal Hill, California, for a total purchase price of $13.8 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of eight buildings and was 98.4% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,200 to 8,000 square feet.\nWe continue to seek to acquire additional properties in our existing markets and generally in close proximity to our existing portfolio; however, there can be no assurance that we will acquire additional facilities that meet our risk-adjusted return and underwriting requirements.\nDevelopment or Redevelopment of Real Estate Facilities\nIn certain instances, we may seek to redevelop our existing real estate or develop new buildings on excess land parcels.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in the process of developing an approximately 83,000 square foot multi-tenant industrial building at our 212 Business Park located in Kent, Washington. As of December 31, 2021, $2.2 million of the estimated $15.4 million total development costs had been incurred and was reflected under land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. This construction project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in the process of developing an approximately 17,000 square foot multi-tenant industrial building at our Boca Commerce Park, located in Boca Raton, Florida. As of December 31, 2021, $1.1 million of the estimated $4.0 million total development costs had been incurred and was reflected under land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. This construction project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nDuring 2021, we completed the development of an 83,000 square foot shallow-bay industrial building on an excess land parcel at our Freeport Business Park located in Irving, Texas for total development costs of $8.1 million. The asset was placed into service on March 1, 2021 and accordingly was reflected under real estate facilities, at cost on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021.\nThe Mile is an office and multifamily park we own which sits on 44.5 contiguous acres of land located in Tysons, Virginia. The park consists of 628,000 square feet of office space and a 395-unit multifamily apartment community we developed, Highgate at The Mile, which we completed in 2017 through a joint venture with the JV Partner. In 2019, we successfully rezoned The Mile allowing us to develop, at our election, up to 3,000 additional multifamily units and approximately 500,000 square feet of other commercial uses.\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into a new joint venture with the JV Partner for the purpose of developing a second multifamily property, Brentford at The Mile, a planned 411-unit multifamily apartment complex. Under the Brentford Joint Venture agreement, the Company has a 98.2% controlling interest and is the managing member with the JV Partner holding the remaining 1.8% limited partnership interest. We contributed the Brentford Parcel at a value of $18.5 million, for which we received equity contribution credit in the Brentford Joint Venture. Our cost basis in the Brentford Parcel was $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021.\nConstruction of Brentford at The Mile commenced in August 2020 and is anticipated to be completed over a period of 24 to 36 months at an estimated development cost of $110 million to $115 million, excluding land cost. As of December 31, 2021, the development cost incurred was $54.8 million, which is reflected in land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets along with our $5.1 million cost basis in the Brentford Parcel. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also recorded non-capitalizable demolition costs of $0.3 million in interest and other expense on our consolidated statements of income.\n\u200e\nWhile multifamily real estate was not previously a core asset class for us, we determined that multifamily real estate represents a unique opportunity and the highest and best use of the Brentford Parcel. Through joint ventures we have partnered with a local developer and operator of multifamily properties in order to leverage their development and operational expertise. The scope and timing of the future phases of development of The Mile are subject to a variety of uncertainties, including site plan approvals and building permits.\nWe consolidate both the joint venture that owns Highgate at The Mile and the joint venture that is developing Brentford at The Mile.\nSee Analysis of Net Income - Multifamily\u201d below and Note 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on Highgate at The Mile and Brentford at The Mile.\nSale of Real Estate Facilities: We may from time to time sell individual real estate facilities based on market conditions, fit with our existing portfolio, evaluation of long-term potential returns of markets or product types, or other reasons.\nOn December 30, 2021, we sold a 53,000 square foot industrial building located in Beltsville, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $4.5 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $3.2 million.\nOn December 29, 2021, we sold a 70,000 square foot industrial-flex building located in Irving, Texas, for net sale proceeds of $8.8 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $6.3 million.\nOn October 19, 2021, we sold a 371,000 square foot industrial-flex business park located in San Diego, California, for net sale proceeds of $311.1 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $301.3 million.\nOn September 17, 2021, we sold a 22,000 square foot industrial-flex building located in Irving, Texas, for net sale proceeds of $3.4 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $2.9 million.\nOn July 16, 2021, we sold a 244,000 square foot office business park located in Herndon, Virginia, for net sale proceeds of $40.5 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $27.0 million.\nOn June 17, 2021, we sold a 198,000 square foot office-oriented flex business park located in Chantilly, Virginia, for net sale proceeds of $32.6 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $19.2 million. (Collectively the 2021 Assets Sold\u201d).\nDuring 2021, we reclassified above-mentioned assets as properties held for sale, net, in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nOn September 16, 2020, we sold two industrial buildings totaling 40,000 square feet located in Redmond, Washington, which were subject to an eminent domain process for net sale proceeds of $11.4 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $7.7 million.\nOn January 7, 2020, we completed the sale of a single-tenant building totaling 113,000 square feet in Rockville, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $29.3 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $19.6 million. (Collectively the 2020 Assets Sold\u201d).\nOn October 8, 2019, we sold three business parks located in Rockville and Silver Springs, Maryland: Metro Park North, Meadow Business Park and WesTech Business Park. The parks, consisting of 28 buildings totaling approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet sold for net sale proceeds of $144.6 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $16.6 million. (Collectively the 2019 Assets Sold\u201d).\nWe have 702,000 rentable square feet of industrial-flex business park located in Irving, Texas, held for sale as of December 31, 2021 and expect to complete the sale of these assets during 2022. The operations of such facilities as well as the sold facilities mentioned above are presented below under assets sold or held for sale.\u201d\n\u200e\nCertain Factors that May Impact Future Results\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic: Starting in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in cessation, severe curtailment, or impairment of business activities in most sectors of the economy in all markets we operate in, due to governmental stay at home\u201d orders, risk mitigation procedures, and closure of businesses not considered to be essential.\u201d Since it remains unknown at this time how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue, particularly given the impact of existing and potential future variants, we cannot estimate how long these negative economic impacts will persist.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has entered into rent relief agreements consisting of $6.2 million of rent deferrals and $1.6 million of rent abatements. As of December 31, 2021, the 317 current customers that received rent relief account for 9.5% of rental income. Also as of December 31, 2021, the Company had collected $5.3 million of rent deferral repayment, representing 99.8% of the amounts scheduled to be repaid through December 2021. An additional $0.9 million of rent deferral repayment is scheduled to be repaid thereafter.\nThe Company also wrote off accounts receivable, net of recoveries and deferred rent receivables of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of February 18, 2022, the Company had open rent relief requests from approximately less than 1% of customers.\nOur ability to re-lease space as leases expire in a way that minimizes vacancy periods and maximizes market rental rates will depend upon market conditions in the specific submarkets in which each of our properties are located. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Company's future ability to grow or maintain existing occupancy levels, possible decreases in rental rates on new and renewal transactions, and the potential negative effect of additional rent deferrals, rent abatements, and customer defaults, we believe in some instances the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have adverse effects on rental income for 2022 and possibly beyond.\nImpact of Inflation: Inflation has significantly increased recently and a continued increase in inflation could adversely impact our future results. The Company continues to seek ways to mitigate its potential impact. A substantial portion of the Company's leases require customers to pay operating expenses, including real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance, as well as increases in common area expenses, which should partially reduce the Company's exposure to inflation.\nRegional Concentration: Our portfolio is concentrated in eight regions, in six states. We have chosen to concentrate in these regions because we believe they have characteristics which enable them to be competitive economically, such as above average population growth, job growth, higher education levels and personal income. Changes in economic conditions in these regions in the future could impact our future results.\nIndustry and Customer Concentrations: We seek to minimize the risk of industry or customer concentrations. As of December 31, 2021, excluding the assets held for sale, only three industry concentrations represented more than 10% of our annualized rental income as depicted in the following table.\nTable 6: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail, food, and automotive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electronics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home furnishings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance and financial services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace/defense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Education\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2021, excluding the assets held for sale, leases from our top 10 customers comprised 10.3% of our annualized rental income with four customers representing more than 1% as depicted in the following table (in thousands).\nTable 7: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customers\n</td> <td>Square Footage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Government\n</td> <td> 465,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amazon Inc.\n</td> <td> 543,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KZ Kitchen Cabinet & Stone\n</td> <td> 370,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Luminex Corporation\n</td> <td> 199,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ECS Federal, LLC\n</td> <td> 143,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lockheed Martin Corporation\n</td> <td> 124,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applied Materials, Inc.\n</td> <td> 173,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CentralColo, LLC\n</td> <td> 96,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Great Way Trading & Transportation, Inc.\n</td> <td> 177,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costco-Innovel Solutions LLC\n</td> <td> 180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td> 2,470,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________\n(1)For leases expiring prior to December 31, 2021, annualized rental income represents income to be received under existing leases from January 1, 2021 through the date of expiration.\nCustomer credit risk: Historically, we have experienced a low level of write-offs of uncollectible rents, with less than 0.4% of rental income written off in any single year from 2011-2019. As of December 31, 2021, our level of write-offs of uncollectible rents were 0.0%, which were below the 0.4% of rental income written off as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of February 18, 2022, we had 25,000 square feet of leased space occupied by one customer that is protected by Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which has no remaining lease value as the lease obligation ended during February 2022. From time to time, customers contact us, requesting early termination of their lease, reductions in space leased, or rent deferment or rent abatement, which we are not obligated to grant but will consider and grant under certain circumstances.\nNet Operating Income\nWe utilize net operating income ( NOI\u201d), a measure that is not defined in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate. We define NOI as rental income less Adjusted Cost of Operations. Adjusted Cost of Operations, a non-GAAP measure, represents cost of operations, excluding stock compensation, which can vary significantly period to period based upon the performance of the Company.\nWe believe NOI assists investors in analyzing the performance of our real estate by excluding (i) corporate overhead (i.e., general and administrative expense) because it does not relate to the direct operating performance of our real estate, (ii) depreciation and amortization expense because it does not accurately reflect changes in the fair value of our real estate, and (iii) stock compensation expense because this expense item can vary significantly from period to period and thus impact comparability across periods. The Company's calculation of NOI may not be comparable to those of other companies and should not be used as an alternative to performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nWe also report NOI on a basis which excludes non-cash rents that have been deferred or abated during the period, certain non-cash revenue items, including amortization of deferred rent receivable, in-place lease intangible, tenant improvement reimbursements, and lease incentives, and also excludes stock-compensation expense for employees whose compensation expense is recorded in cost of operations ( Cash NOI\u201d). We utilize Cash NOI to evaluate the cash flow performance of our properties and believe investors and analysts utilize this metric for the same purpose. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nSee Analysis of net income\u201d below for reconciliations of each of these measures to their closest analogous GAAP measure from our consolidated statements of income.\n\u200e\nTable 8: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Results for 2021 and 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net income allocable to common stockholders was $393.1 million or $14.22 per diluted share, compared to $124.6 million or $4.52 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to a $332.6 million higher gain on sale of real estate facilities sold in 2021 than in 2020, an $18.3 million increase in NOI from our Same Park portfolio (defined below), a $6.7 million increase in NOI from our Non-Same Park portfolio (defined below), and $1.6 million lower preferred distributions in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the redemption of preferred stock in November 2021, partially offset by a decrease of $5.9 million in NOI generated from assets sold or held for sale, $6.4 million non-cash charge related to the above mentioned 2021 redemption of preferred stock, and $3.6 million charge for a state income tax provision due to differences between state and federal tax codes.\nOperating Results for 2020 and 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net income allocable to common stockholders was $124.6 million or $4.52 per diluted share, compared to $108.7 million or $3.95 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to an $11.0 million non-cash charge related to the redemption of preferred stock incurred in 2019 that did not reoccur in 2020, $10.6 million higher gain on sale of real estate facilities sold in 2020 than in 2019, $6.2 million lower preferred distributions in 2020 compared to 2019, and an increase of $3.9 million in NOI from our Non-Same Park portfolio, partially offset by

sale. Also included in the respective periods in 2021 are the 2021 Assets Sold totaling 1.0 million square feet. As of December 31, 2020, Assets sold or held for sale includes the 0.7 million square feet of AHFS, along with the 2021 Assets Sold, and the 2020 Assets sold totaling 153,000 square feet. As of December 31, 2019, Assets sold or held for sale includes the 0.7 million square feet of AHFS, along with the 2021 Assets Sold, the 2020 Assets sold, and the 2019 Assets Sold totaling 1.3 million square feet.\n(2)Adjusted Cost of Operations excludes the impact of stock compensation expense.\n(3)Stock compensation expense, as shown here, represents stock compensation expense for employees whose compensation expense is recorded in cost of operations. Note that stock compensation expense attributable to our executive management team (including divisional vice presidents) and other corporate employees is recorded within general and administrative expense.\n(4)NOI represents rental income less Adjusted Cost of Operations.\n\u200e\nRental income increased $23.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020 and decreased $14.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 was due primarily to higher occupancy, a reduction in rent abatements granted to certain customers in 2021 compared to 2020, lower write-offs of accounts receivable and deferred rent receivable in 2021 compared to 2020, combined with rental income from our Non-Same Park portfolio acquired during the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental income from assets sold. The decrease in 2020 was due primarily to reduced rental income from assets sold, partially offset by an increase in rental income from our Non-Same Park and Same Park portfolio.\nCost of operations increased $5.4 million in 2021 compared to 2020 and decreased $2.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 was due primarily to higher Adjusted Cost of Operations incurred by our Same Park (discussed below) and Non-Same Park portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in Adjusted Cost of Operations from assets sold. The decrease in 2020 was due primarily to reduced operating expenses from assets sold, partially offset by higher Adjusted Cost of Operations incurred by our Same Park and Non-Same Park portfolios.\nNet income increased $346.3 million in 2021 compared to 2020 and increased $2.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 was mainly due to higher gain on sale of real estate facilities sold in 2021 than 2020 combined with higher NOI, partially offset by higher general and administrative expense in 2021 than 2020 and higher other expenses in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in 2020 was mainly due to higher gain on sale of real estate facilities sold in 2020 than 2019 combined with lower depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by lower NOI and lower interest and other income.\n\u200e\nSame Park Portfolio\nWe believe that evaluation of the Same Park portfolio provides an informative view of how the Company's portfolio has performed over comparable periods.

The increase in 2021 was due primarily to higher rental rates charged to customers, as revenue per occupied square foot increased 4.2%, weighted average occupancy increased 1.7% in 2021, and lower rent deferrals and rent abatements granted in 2021, combined with lower write-offs of accounts receivable and deferred rent receivable in 2021. The increase in 2020 was due primarily to higher rental rates charged to customers, as revenue per occupied square foot increased 2.8%, partially offset by a 1.7% decrease in weighted average occupancy in 2020 compared to 2019, rent deferrals and rent abatements granted in 2020, and higher write-offs of accounts receivable and deferred rent receivable in 2020.\nThe following table details

Adjusted Costs of Operations increased 2.6% in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher property taxes, higher repairs and maintenance, higher payroll costs, and higher insurance costs, partially offset by lower utility costs and savings from snow removal costs.\nProperty taxes increased 1.9% in 2021 compared to 2020 and 5.9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher assessed values. We expect potential property tax growth in the future due to higher assessed values.\nUtilities are dependent upon energy prices and usage levels. Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature. Utilities increased 5.2% in 2021 compared to 2020 and decreased 4.2% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 were driven by reduced consumption in 2020 resulting from the shelter in place order\u201d due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the second and third quarter of 2020. The decrease in 2020 was due primarily to a rate reduction related to adopting a renewable energy program during the year as well as reduced water and electricity usage due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is difficult to estimate future utility costs because weather, temperature and energy prices are volatile and not readily predictable. However, we expect utility costs in the future to be higher than our results for year ended December 31, 2021 due to increased traffic and use at our parks as our customers resume operations.\nRepairs and maintenance increased 1.6% in 2021 compared to 2020 and 4.5% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to increased property services combined with higher landscaping repairs and security costs, as well as reduced consumption in 2020 resulting from the shelter in place order\u201d due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the second and third quarter of 2020. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to increased property services combined with higher landscaping repairs and security costs incurred partially offset by a reduction in general repairs and maintenance projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we expect repairs and maintenance costs in the future to be higher than our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of increased traffic and use at our parks as customers resume normalized operations.\nPayroll expense increased 3.6% in 2021 compared to 2020 and 5.5% in 2020 compared to 2019. Payroll expense includes on site and supervisory personnel costs incurred in the operation of our properties. The increases in payroll was primarily due to salary increases and promotions. We expect payroll expenses to continue to increase in the future.\nSnow removal increased 338.2% in 2021 compared to 2020 and decreased 77.4% in 2020 compared to 2019. Snow removal costs are weather dependent and therefore not predictable.\nProperty insurance expense increased 21.2% in 2021 compared to 2020 and 20.6% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a 20% rate increase for the policy period June 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022 due to unfavorable market conditions pervasive throughout commercial real estate sectors combined with insurance deductibles recorded during 2021 related to damage from the winter storm in Texas. The increase in property insurance expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was also primarily due to an increase in our property insurance premiums for the policy period June 2020 to May 2021. We expect to experience increases in property insurance expense in the future as unfavorable market conditions pervasive throughout commercial real estate sectors persist.\nOther expenses increased 4.1% in 2021 compared to 2020 and decreased 7.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. Other expenses are general property expenses incurred in the operation of our properties. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to certain office related expenses and professional services. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to higher than average professional fees related to ordinary course tenant related matters incurred in 2019, which did not recur in 2020. We expect other expenses to be comparable to our results for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u200e\nSame Park Quarterly Trends\nThe following table sets forth historical quarterly data related to

estimated expense recoveries (excluding the impact of certain items such as concessions or future escalators) on new leases or extensions executed in the period, and the outgoing monthly cash rental rates inclusive of estimated expense recoveries last billed on the previous lease for that space. Leases executed on spaces vacant for more than the preceding twelve months have been excluded from this measure.\n(2)Net effective rent represents average rental payments for the term of a lease on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP and excludes operating expense reimbursements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, weighted average occupancy was 94.4%, an increase from weighted average occupancy of 92.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Weighted average cash rental rate growth on leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2021 was 4.9% while average net effective rent1 growth was 14.4%. Renewals of leases with existing customers represented 63.3% of our leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2021. Average lease term of the leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3.4 years, with associated average transaction costs (tenant improvements and leasing commissions) of $3.33 per square foot. For comparative purposes, average lease term and transaction costs on leases executed in the same period of 2020 were 3.4 years and $2.58 per square foot, respectively.\n________________________\n1Net effective rent represents average rental payments for the term of a lease on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP, excluding operating expense reimbursements.\nNon-Same Park Portfolio: The table below reflects the assets comprising our Non-Same Park portfolio (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Occupancy at\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Date Acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jupiter Business Park\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Plano, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 25,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Port America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Grapevine, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pickett Industrial Park\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alexandria, VA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>La Mirada Commerce Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>La Mirada, CA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>San Tomas Business Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Santa Clara, CA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hathaway Industrial Park\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Santa Fe Springs, CA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Walnut Avenue Business Park\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Signal Hill, CA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Acquired Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 343,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Occupancy at\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Developed Property\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freeport Industrial Building\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Irving, TX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 352,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our management and operating infrastructure typically allows us to generate higher NOI from newly acquired real estate facilities than was achieved by previous owners. However, it can take 24 or more months for us to fully achieve higher NOI, and the ultimate levels of NOI achieved can be affected by changes in general economic conditions. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Company's ability to generate higher NOI from these newly acquired real estate facilities in the future, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our expectations with respect to newly acquired real estate facilities.\nMultifamily: As of December 31, 2021, we held a 95.0% controlling interest in a joint venture that owns Highgate at The Mile, a 395-unit apartment complex in Tysons, Virginia.

The increase in cost of operations was attributed to an increase in property tax assessments. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Company's future ability to maintain existing occupancy levels and rental rates, we may continue to experience NOI levels below those which were achieved prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the future.\n\u200e\nAssets sold or held for sale: These amounts include historical operating results with respect to properties that were sold or held for sale.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the operating results include the following: 0.7 million square feet of AHFS and 1.0 million square feet of 2021 Assets Sold.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the operating results include the following: 0.7 million square feet of AHFS, 1.0 million square feet of 2021 Assets Sold, and 153,000 square feet of 2020 Assets Sold.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the operating results include the following: 0.7 million square feet of AHFS, 1.0 million square feet of 2021 Assets Sold, 153,000 square feet of 2020 Assets Sold, and 1.3 million square feet of 2019 Assets Sold.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 2.9% in 2021 compared to 2020 and decreased 7.6% in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in 2021 over 2020 was primarily due to acceleration of depreciation expense related to a building reclassified to held for development in 2020, which is also the primary reason for the decrease in 2020 over 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expense primarily represents executive and other compensation, including non-cash stock compensation, audit and tax fees, legal expenses and other costs associated with being a public company. General and administrative expense increased $4.5 million, or 31.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020 and $0.8 million, or 5.6%, in 2020 compared to 2019.\nThe increase in 2021 over 2020 was primarily due to increase in compensation expense mainly due to the addition of the new President and CEO, partially offset by the departure of the former COO, combined with an increase in stock compensation expense, as well as an increase in professional fees related to the reincorporation of PSB from the state of California to the state of Maryland in the second quarter of 2021, the increase was also attributable to legal fees related to various corporate service projects and an increase in executive procurement costs. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in expense due to accelerated stock compensation expense related to the former CEO retirement in the prior year. The increase in 2020 over 2019 was primarily due to higher stock compensation expense due to accelerated stock compensation expense for the former CEO (mentioned above) and an increase in professional fees related to various corporate service projects. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense related to our President and CEO's retirement and stock compensation expense incurred during 2019 tied to a modification of the Director Retirement Plan which did not recur in 2020.\nSale of Real Estate Facilities\nOn December 30, 2021, the Company sold a 53,000 square foot industrial building located in Beltsville, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $4.5 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $3.2 million.\nOn December 29, 2021, the Company sold a 70,000 square foot industrial-flex building located in Irving, Texas, for net sale proceeds of $8.8 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $6.3 million.\nOn October 19, 2021, the Company sold a 371,000 square foot industrial-flex business park located in San Diego, California, for net sale proceeds of $311.1 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $301.3 million.\nOn September 17, 2021, the Company sold a 22,000 square foot industrial-flex building located in Irving, Texas, for net sale proceeds of $3.4 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $2.9 million.\nOn July 16, 2021, the Company sold a 244,000 square foot office business park located in Herndon, Virginia, for net sale proceeds of $40.5 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $27.0 million.\nOn June 17, 2021, the Company sold a 198,000 square foot office-oriented flex business park located in Chantilly, Virginia, for net sale proceeds of $32.6 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $19.2 million.\nOn September 16, 2020, the Company sold two industrial buildings totaling 40,000 square feet located in Redmond, Washington, which were subject to an eminent domain process for net sale proceeds of $11.4 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $7.7 million.\nOn January 7, 2020, the Company sold a 113,000 square foot office building located at Metro Park North in Rockville, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $29.3 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $19.6 million.\nOn October 8, 2019, the Company sold 1.3 million rentable square feet located in Rockville and Silver Spring, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $144.6 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $16.6 million.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 and the notes to our consolidated financial statements, which set forth the major components of our historical liquidity and capital resources. The discussion below sets forth the factors which we expect will affect our future liquidity and capital resources or which may vary substantially from historical levels.\nOverview\nOur expected material cash requirements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and thereafter consist of (i) contractually obligated expenditures, including payments of principal and interest; (ii) other essential expenditures, including property operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and dividends paid in accordance with REIT distribution requirements; and (iii) opportunistic expenditures, including acquisitions and developments and repurchases of our securities. We expect to satisfy these short-term and long-term cash requirements through operating cash flow, disposition proceeds and opportunistic debt and equity financing.\nSources of Capital\nOperating Cash Flow: We believe that our net cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing requirements for debt service, capital expenditures and distributions to our stockholders for the foreseeable future. In the last five years, we have retained $40 to $60 million in operating cash flow per year. Retained operating cash flow represents cash flow provided by operating activities, less stockholder and unit holder distributions and capital expenditures, excluding development costs. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had $27.1 million in unrestricted cash.\nProceeds from Dispositions: Refer to Business Overview-Sale of Real Estate Facilities\u201d above for a discussion of our dispositions. We expect to continue sell properties that are no longer consistent with our investment strategy and expect to use the proceeds from these dispositions to fund new acquisitions, development or other cash requirements.\nAccess to Capital Markets: As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income\u201d to our stockholders each year, which relative to a taxable C corporation, limits the amount of cash flow from operations that we can retain for investment purposes, such as to fund acquisitions and developments. As a result, in order to grow our asset base, access to capital is important.\nOur financial profile is characterized by strong credit metrics, including low leverage relative to our total capitalization and operating cash flows. We are a highly rated REIT, as determined by Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Our corporate credit rating by Standard and Poor's is A-, while our preferred stock are rated BBB by Standard and Poor's and Baa2 by Moody's. We believe our credit profile and ratings will enable us to efficiently access both the public and private capital markets to raise capital, as necessary.\nIn order to maintain efficient access to the capital markets, we target a minimum ratio of FFO (as defined below) to combined fixed charges and preferred distributions of 3.0 to 1.0. Ratio of FFO to fixed charges and preferred distributions is calculated by dividing FFO excluding fixed charges and preferred distributions by fixed charges and preferred distributions paid. Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and preferred equity distributions paid. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the ratio of FFO to combined fixed charges and preferred distributions paid was 6.1 to 1.0.\nIn August 2021, we amended and restated the credit agreement governing our revolving Credit Facility to increase the aggregate principal amount of the Credit Facility from $250.0 million to $400.0 million and extend the expiration date to August 2025. The Credit Facility can also be expanded to $700.0 million. We can use the Credit Facility as necessary as temporary financing until we are able to raise longer term capital. Historically we have funded our long-term capital requirements with retained operating cash flow and proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred securities. We will select among these sources of capital based upon availability, relative cost, the impact of constraints on our operations (such as covenants), and the desire for leverage.\n\u200e\nCash Requirements\nContractual Commitments: Our material contractual commitments as of December 31, 2021 consist of principal and interest on our Credit Facility, payment of dividends on our preferred stock (which if not paid will accrue), contractual construction commitments for development projects, and ground lease obligations:\n\uf0b7Credit Facility: As of December 31, 2021, we have $32.0 million outstanding on our Credit Facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, the Company repaid in full the balance outstanding as of December 31, 2021. We are in compliance with all of the covenants and other requirements of our Credit Facility. Our Credit Facility expires in August 2025.\n\uf0b7Preferred stock dividends: We paid $46.6 million to preferred stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect to continue to pay quarterly distributions of $9.6 million to our preferred stockholders for the foreseeable future or until such time as there is a change in the amount or composition of our series of preferred equity outstanding. Dividends on preferred equity are paid when and if declared by our Board and accumulate if not paid.\n\uf0b7Contractual commitments: Contractual construction commitments as of December 31, 2021 are approximately $43.6 million.\n\uf0b7Ground lease obligations: Our contractual payment requirements under various operating leases as of December 31, 2021 are approximately $0.2 million for 2022 and $1.4 million thereafter.\nCapital Expenditures: We define recurring capital expenditures as those necessary to maintain and operate our real estate at its current economic value. Nonrecurring capital improvements generally are related to property reconfigurations and other capital expenditures related to repositioning asset acquisitions.\nThe following table sets forth our commercial capital expenditures paid for in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 on an aggregate and per square foot basis:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

annual Same Park recurring capital expenditures have ranged between 10.7% and 14.3% as a percentage of NOI, and we expected future recurring capital expenditures to be within this range. While what we disclose herein with respect to capital expenditures represents our best estimates at this time, there can be no assurance that these amounts will not change substantially in the future for various reasons, including the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on capital projects and leasing volume.\nRedemption of Preferred Stock: Shares of preferred stock are redeemable by the Company five years after issuance or in order to preserve its status as a REIT, but shares of preferred stock are never redeemable at the option of the holder. Historically, we have reduced our cost of capital by refinancing higher coupon preferred securities with lower coupon preferred securities. In November 2021, our 5.20% Series W preferred shares, with a par value of $189.8 million, were redeemed at par. Our Series X preferred shares, with a coupon rate of 5.25%, at a par value of $230.0 million and Series Y preferred shares, with a coupon rate of 5.20% ,at a par value of $200.0 million are redeemable in September 2022 and December 2022, respectively. Future redemptions of preferred stock will depend upon many factors, including available cash and our cost of capital. Refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements or more information on our preferred stock.\nAcquisitions of real estate facilities: Refer to Business Overview-Acquisition of Real Estate Facilities\u201d above for a discussion of our recent acquisitions. We continue to seek to acquire additional real estate facilities; however, there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities in our markets and there can be no assurance as to the volume of future acquisition activity.\nDevelopment real estate facilities: Refer to Business Overview-Development of Real Estate Facilities\u201d above for a discussion of our recently completed developments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in the process of developing an approximately 83,000 square foot multi-tenant industrial building at our 212 Business Park located in Kent, Washington. As of December 31, 2021, $2.2 million of the estimated $15.4 million total development costs had been incurred and was reflected under land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. This construction project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we have contractual construction commitments totaling $1.2 million that will be paid to various contractors as the project is completed.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in the process of developing an approximately 17,000 square foot multi-tenant industrial building at our Boca Commerce Park, located in Boca Raton, Florida. As of December 31, 2021, $1.1 million of the estimated $4.0 million total development costs had been incurred and was reflected under land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. This construction project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we have contractual construction commitments totaling $2.9 million that will be paid to various contractors as the project is completed.\nIn August 2020, we entered into the Brentford Joint Venture for the purpose of developing a second multifamily property, Brentford at The Mile, a planned 411-unit multifamily apartment complex. We contributed the Brentford Parcel at a value of $18.5 million, for which we received equity contribution credit in the Brentford Joint Venture. Our cost basis in the Brentford Parcel was $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021.\nConstruction of Brentford at The Mile commenced in August 2020 and is anticipated to be completed over a period of 24 to 36 months at an estimated development cost of $110 million to $115 million, excluding land cost. As of December 31, 2021, the development cost incurred was $54.8 million, which is reflected in land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets along with our $5.1 million cost basis in the Brentford Parcel. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded non-capitalizable demolition costs of $0.3 million in interest and other expense on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2021, we have contractual construction commitments totaling $39.3 million that will be paid to various contractors as the project is completed.\nRepurchase of Common Stock: Our Board has approved a common stock repurchase program and we may in the future acquire our shares under the program. As of December 31, 2021, management has the authorization to repurchase an additional 1,614,721 shares. No shares of common stock were repurchased under the board-approved common stock repurchase program during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nRequirement to Pay Distributions: Our election to be taxed as a REIT, as defined by the Code, applies to all periods presented herein. As a REIT, we do not incur U.S. federal corporate income tax on our REIT taxable income\u201d that is distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and we continue to meet certain organizational and operational requirements. We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect we will continue to qualify as a REIT in future periods.\nWe paid REIT qualifying distributions of $288.3 million ($45.7 million to preferred stockholders and $242.6 million to common stockholders) during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe declared a one-time special cash dividend of $4.60 per share (the Special Cash Dividend\u201d) along with the fourth quarter regular dividend of $1.05 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Special Cash Dividend was declared to distribute a portion of the excess income attributable to gains on sales from asset dispositions during 2021.\nOur consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to set dividend distribution amounts based on our taxable income. Future quarterly distributions with respect to common stock will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements and, along with distributions to preferred stockholders, we expect will be funded with cash provided by operating activities.\n\u200e\nTable 24: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations, and Funds Available for Distribution\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunds from Operations ( FFO\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and is considered a helpful measure of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. FFO represents GAAP net income before real estate depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses on sales of operating properties and land and impairment charges on real estate assets.\nWe also present Core FFO and Funds Available for Distribution ( FAD\u201d) which are both also non-GAAP measures. The Company defines Core FFO as FFO excluding the impact of (i) income allocated to preferred stockholders to the extent redemption value exceeds the related carrying value and (ii) other nonrecurring income or expense items as appropriate. FAD represents Core FFO adjusted to (i) deduct recurring capital improvements and capitalized tenant improvements and lease commissions and (ii) remove certain non-cash income or expense items such as amortization of deferred rent receivable and stock compensation expense.\nFFO for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6.67 per share representing an increase of 2.5% from the same period in 2020. The increases in FFO per share were the result of higher NOI, partially offset by the $6.4 million non-cash charge related to the redemption of the Series W preferred stock, the $3.6 million for state income tax provision as described above, as well as higher general and administrative expense.\nCore FFO was $6.97 and $6.57 per share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Core FFO excludes the impact of (i) the $6.4 million non-cash charge related to the redemption of the Series W preferred stock in November 2021 (ii) a $3.6 million charge for a state income tax provision due to differences between state and federal tax code, and (iii) a one-time cost associated with the Company's reincorporation as a Maryland corporation of $0.5 million incurred during the second quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Core FFO excludes the impact of (i) accelerated amortization of stock compensation expense of $1.7 million related to the retirement of our former President and CEO and (ii) non-capitalizable demolition costs of $0.3 million.\n\u200e\nThe following table reconciles net income allocable to common stockholders to FFO, Core FFO and FAD as well as net income per

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP.\u201d) The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nWe continually evaluate the estimates, judgments, and assumptions we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Changes in estimates, judgments, or assumptions could affect our financial position and our results of operations, which are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance.\nCritical Accounting Estimates:\nOur critical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with GAAP, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting estimates are described below.\nRecognition of real estate acquired: Generally, our acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate are accounted for as asset acquisitions and not business combinations because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). The accounting model for asset acquisitions requires that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. We estimate the fair value of land, buildings, intangible assets, and intangible liabilities for purposes of allocating purchase price.\nSuch estimates, which are determined with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists where appropriate, are based upon many assumptions and judgments, including, but not limited to:\n\uf0b7market rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate and intangible assets;\n\uf0b7building and material cost levels;\n\uf0b7estimated market rent levels;\n\uf0b7future revenue growth rates;\n\uf0b7future cash flows from the real estate and the existing customer base, and\n\uf0b7comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land transactions.\nIn calculating value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2021, we used discount rates ranging from 5.5% and 6.0% and a capitalization rate of 5.0%. Others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which could result in different depreciation and amortization expense, rental income, gains, and losses on sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible assets.\nWe completed acquisitions of two properties for a total purchase price of $148.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed. Refer to the Acquisitions\u201d section of Note 3 - Real estate facilities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\u200e\nImpairment of long-lived assets: For each reporting period, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets, including our rental properties, construction in progress, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee, and intangibles, to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. If triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.\nUpon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the asset is expected to be held and used. We may also adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.\nImpairment of real estate assets classified as held for sale: A property is classified as held for sale when all of the accounting criteria for a plan of sale have been met. Upon classification as held for sale, we recognize an impairment charge, if necessary, to lower the carrying amount of the real estate asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. The determination of fair value can involve significant judgments and assumptions. We develop key assumptions based on the following available factors: (i) contractual sales price, (ii) preliminary non-binding letters of intent, or (iii) other available comparable market information. If this information is not available, we use estimated replacement costs or estimated cash flow projections that utilize estimated discount and capitalization rates. These estimates are subject to uncertainty and therefore require significant judgment by us. We review all assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. Subsequently, as a result of our quarterly assessment, we may recognize an incremental impairment charge for any decrease in the asset's fair value less cost to sell. Conversely, we may recognize a gain for a subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, limited to the cumulative net loss previously recognized.\nThe analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets involves identification of indicators of impairment, projections of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair values or selling prices, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity. Others could come to materially different conclusions. In addition, we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment. Any unidentified impairment loss, or change in conclusions, could have a material adverse impact on our net income.\nThe evaluation for impairment and calculation of the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used involves consideration of factors and calculations that are different than the estimate of fair value of assets classified as held for sale. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.\n\u200e\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company is a fully-integrated, self-advised and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, acquires, and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex and low-rise suburban office space. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned and operated 27.7 million rentable square feet of commercial space in six states consisting of 97 parks and 666 buildings. The Company's properties are primarily located in major coastal markets that have experienced long-term economic growth. The Company also held a 95.0% interest in a joint venture entity which owns Highgate at The Mile, a 395-unit multifamily apartment complex located in Tysons, Virginia, and a 98.2% interest in a joint venture formed to develop Brentford at The Mile, a planned 411-unit multifamily apartment complex also located in Tysons, Virginia. Our strong and conservative capital structure allows us the flexibility to use debt and equity capital prudently to fund our growth, which allows us to acquire properties we believe will create long-term value. From time to time we sell properties which no longer fit the Company's strategic objectives.\nExisting Real Estate Facilities: The operating results of our existing real estate facilities are substantially influenced by demand for rental space within our properties and our markets, which impacts occupancy, rental rates, and capital expenditure requirements. We strive to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates and minimizing capital expenditures when market conditions allow, although the Company may decrease rental rates in markets where conditions require. Management's initiatives and strategies with respect to our existing real estate facilities, which include incentivizing our personnel to maximize the return on investment for each lease transaction and provide a superior level of service to our customers.\nAcquisitions of Real Estate Facilities: We seek to grow our portfolio through acquisitions of facilities generally consistent with the Company's focus on owning concentrated business parks with easy to configure space and in markets and product types with favorable long-term return potential.\nOn November 18, 2021, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 141,000 rentable square feet in Plano, Texas, for a total purchase price of $25.6 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of 5 buildings and was 97.3% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,400 to 25,000 square feet.\nOn September 1, 2021, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 718,000 rentable square feet in Grapevine, Texas, for a total purchase price of $123.3 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of 15 buildings and was 96.1% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 2,000 to 20,000 square feet.\nOn October 28, 2020, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 246,000 rentable square feet in Alexandria, Virginia, for a total purchase price of $46.6 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of three buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 7,000 to 75,000 square feet.\nOn January 10, 2020, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 73,000 rentable square feet in La Mirada, California, for a total purchase price of $13.5 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of five buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,200 to 3,000 square feet.\nOn December 20, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial-flex business park comprising approximately 79,000 rentable square feet in Santa Clara, California, for a total purchase price of $16.8 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of nine buildings and was 95.6% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 200 to 3,500 square feet.\nOn September 5, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 543,000 rentable square feet in Santa Fe Springs, California, for a total purchase price of $104.3 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of ten buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 5,000 to 288,000 square feet.\nOn April 18, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 74,000 rentable square feet in Signal Hill, California, for a total purchase price of $13.8 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of eight buildings and was 98.4% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,200 to 8,000 square feet.\nWe continue to seek to acquire additional properties in our existing markets and generally in close proximity to our existing portfolio; however, there can be no assurance that we will acquire additional facilities that meet our risk-adjusted return and underwriting requirements.\nDevelopment or Redevelopment of Real Estate Facilities\nIn certain instances, we may seek to redevelop our existing real estate or develop new buildings on excess land parcels.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in the process of developing an approximately 83,000 square foot multi-tenant industrial building at our 212 Business Park located in Kent, Washington. As of December 31, 2021, $2.2 million of the estimated $15.4 million total development costs had been incurred and was reflected under land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. This construction project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in the process of developing an approximately 17,000 square foot multi-tenant industrial building at our Boca Commerce Park, located in Boca Raton, Florida. As of December 31, 2021, $1.1 million of the estimated $4.0 million total development costs had been incurred and was reflected under land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. This construction project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nDuring 2021, we completed the development of an 83,000 square foot shallow-bay industrial building on an excess land parcel at our Freeport Business Park located in Irving, Texas for total development costs of $8.1 million. The asset was placed into service on March 1, 2021 and accordingly was reflected under real estate facilities, at cost on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021.\nThe Mile is an office and multifamily park we own which sits on 44.5 contiguous acres of land located in Tysons, Virginia. The park consists of 628,000 square feet of office space and a 395-unit multifamily apartment community we developed, Highgate at The Mile, which we completed in 2017 through a joint venture with the JV Partner. In 2019, we successfully rezoned The Mile allowing us to develop, at our election, up to 3,000 additional multifamily units and approximately 500,000 square feet of other commercial uses.\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into a new joint venture with the JV Partner for the purpose of developing a second multifamily property, Brentford at The Mile, a planned 411-unit multifamily apartment complex. Under the Brentford Joint Venture agreement, the Company has a 98.2% controlling interest and is the managing member with the JV Partner holding the remaining 1.8% limited partnership interest. We contributed the Brentford Parcel at a value of $18.5 million, for which we received equity contribution credit in the Brentford Joint Venture. Our cost basis in the Brentford Parcel was $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021.\nConstruction of Brentford at The Mile commenced in August 2020 and is anticipated to be completed over a period of 24 to 36 months at an estimated development cost of $110 million to $115 million, excluding land cost. As of December 31, 2021, the development cost incurred was $54.8 million, which is reflected in land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets along with our $5.1 million cost basis in the Brentford Parcel. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also recorded non-capitalizable demolition costs of $0.3 million in interest and other expense on our consolidated statements of income.\n\u200e\nWhile multifamily real estate was not previously a core asset class for us, we determined that multifamily real estate represents a unique opportunity and the highest and best use of the Brentford Parcel. Through joint ventures we have partnered with a local developer and operator of multifamily properties in order to leverage their development and operational expertise. The scope and timing of the future phases of development of The Mile are subject to a variety of uncertainties, including site plan approvals and building permits.\nWe consolidate both the joint venture that owns Highgate at The Mile and the joint venture that is developing Brentford at The Mile.\nSee Analysis of Net Income - Multifamily\u201d below and Note 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on Highgate at The Mile and Brentford at The Mile.\nSale of Real Estate Facilities: We may from time to time sell individual real estate facilities based on market conditions, fit with our existing portfolio, evaluation of long-term potential returns of markets or product types, or other reasons.\nOn December 30, 2021, we sold a 53,000 square foot industrial building located in Beltsville, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $4.5 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $3.2 million.\nOn December 29, 2021, we sold a 70,000 square foot industrial-flex building located in Irving, Texas, for net sale proceeds of $8.8 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $6.3 million.\nOn October 19, 2021, we sold a 371,000 square foot industrial-flex business park located in San Diego, California, for net sale proceeds of $311.1 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $301.3 million.\nOn September 17, 2021, we sold a 22,000 square foot industrial-flex building located in Irving, Texas, for net sale proceeds of $3.4 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $2.9 million.\nOn July 16, 2021, we sold a 244,000 square foot office business park located in Herndon, Virginia, for net sale proceeds of $40.5 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $27.0 million.\nOn June 17, 2021, we sold a 198,000 square foot office-oriented flex business park located in Chantilly, Virginia, for net sale proceeds of $32.6 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $19.2 million. (Collectively the 2021 Assets Sold\u201d).\nDuring 2021, we reclassified above-mentioned assets as properties held for sale, net, in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nOn September 16, 2020, we sold two industrial buildings totaling 40,000 square feet located in Redmond, Washington, which were subject to an eminent domain process for net sale proceeds of $11.4 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $7.7 million.\nOn January 7, 2020, we completed the sale of a single-tenant building totaling 113,000 square feet in Rockville, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $29.3 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $19.6 million. (Collectively the 2020 Assets Sold\u201d).\nOn October 8, 2019, we sold three business parks located in Rockville and Silver Springs, Maryland: Metro Park North, Meadow Business Park and WesTech Business Park. The parks, consisting of 28 buildings totaling approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet sold for net sale proceeds of $144.6 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $16.6 million. (Collectively the 2019 Assets Sold\u201d).\nWe have 702,000 rentable square feet of industrial-flex business park located in Irving, Texas, held for sale as of December 31, 2021 and expect to complete the sale of these assets during 2022. The operations of such facilities as well as the sold facilities mentioned above are presented below under assets sold or held for sale.\u201d\n\u200e\nCertain Factors that May Impact Future Results\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic: Starting in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in cessation, severe curtailment, or impairment of business activities in most sectors of the economy in all markets we operate in, due to governmental stay at home\u201d orders, risk mitigation procedures, and closure of businesses not considered to be essential.\u201d Since it remains unknown at this time how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue, particularly given the impact of existing and potential future variants, we cannot estimate how long these negative economic impacts will persist.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has entered into rent relief agreements consisting of $6.2 million of rent deferrals and $1.6 million of rent abatements. As of December 31, 2021, the 317 current customers that received rent relief account for 9.5% of rental income. Also as of December 31, 2021, the Company had collected $5.3 million of rent deferral repayment, representing 99.8% of the amounts scheduled to be repaid through December 2021. An additional $0.9 million of rent deferral repayment is scheduled to be repaid thereafter.\nThe Company also wrote off accounts receivable, net of recoveries and deferred rent receivables of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of February 18, 2022, the Company had open rent relief requests from approximately less than 1% of customers.\nOur ability to re-lease space as leases expire in a way that minimizes vacancy periods and maximizes market rental rates will depend upon market conditions in the specific submarkets in which each of our properties are located. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Company's future ability to grow or maintain existing occupancy levels, possible decreases in rental rates on new and renewal transactions, and the potential negative effect of additional rent deferrals, rent abatements, and customer defaults, we believe in some instances the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have adverse effects on rental income for 2022 and possibly beyond.\nImpact of Inflation: Inflation has significantly increased recently and a continued increase in inflation could adversely impact our future results. The Company continues to seek ways to mitigate its potential impact. A substantial portion of the Company's leases require customers to pay operating expenses, including real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance, as well as increases in common area expenses, which should partially reduce the Company's exposure to inflation.\nRegional Concentration: Our portfolio is concentrated in eight regions, in six states. We have chosen to concentrate in these regions because we believe they have characteristics which enable them to be competitive economically, such as above average population growth, job growth, higher education levels and personal income. Changes in economic conditions in these regions in the future could impact our future results.\nIndustry and Customer Concentrations: We seek to minimize the risk of industry or customer concentrations. As of December 31, 2021, excluding the assets held for sale, only three industry concentrations represented more than 10% of our annualized rental income as depicted in the following table.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, excluding the assets held for sale, leases from our top 10 customers comprised 10.3% of our annualized rental income with four customers representing more than 1% as depicted in the following table (in thousands).\n\n____________________________\n(1)For leases expiring prior to December 31, 2021, annualized rental income represents income to be received under existing leases from January 1, 2021 through the date of expiration.\nCustomer credit risk: Historically, we have experienced a low level of write-offs of uncollectible rents, with less than 0.4% of rental income written off in any single year from 2011-2019. As of December 31, 2021, our level of write-offs of uncollectible rents were 0.0%, which were below the 0.4% of rental income written off as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of February 18, 2022, we had 25,000 square feet of leased space occupied by one customer that is protected by Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which has no remaining lease value as the lease obligation ended during February 2022. From time to time, customers contact us, requesting early termination of their lease, reductions in space leased, or rent deferment or rent abatement, which we are not obligated to grant but will consider and grant under certain circumstances.\nNet Operating Income\nWe utilize net operating income ( NOI\u201d), a measure that is not defined in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate. We define NOI as rental income less Adjusted Cost of Operations. Adjusted Cost of Operations, a non-GAAP measure, represents cost of operations, excluding stock compensation, which can vary significantly period to period based upon the performance of the Company.\nWe believe NOI assists investors in analyzing the performance of our real estate by excluding (i) corporate overhead (i.e., general and administrative expense) because it does not relate to the direct operating performance of our real estate, (ii) depreciation and amortization expense because it does not accurately reflect changes in the fair value of our real estate, and (iii) stock compensation expense because this expense item can vary significantly from period to period and thus impact comparability across periods. The Company's calculation of NOI may not be comparable to those of other companies and should not be used as an alternative to performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nWe also report NOI on a basis which excludes non-cash rents that have been deferred or abated during the period, certain non-cash revenue items, including amortization of deferred rent receivable, in-place lease intangible, tenant improvement reimbursements, and lease incentives, and also excludes stock-compensation expense for employees whose compensation expense is recorded in cost of operations ( Cash NOI\u201d). We utilize Cash NOI to evaluate the cash flow performance of our properties and believe investors and analysts utilize this metric for the same purpose. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nSee Analysis of net income\u201d below for reconciliations of each of these measures to their closest analogous GAAP measure from our consolidated statements of income.\n\u200e\n Results of Operations \nOperating Results for 2021 and 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net income allocable to common stockholders was $393.1 million or $14.22 per diluted share, compared to $124.6 million or $4.52 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to a $332.6 million higher gain on sale of real estate facilities sold in 2021 than in 2020, an $18.3 million increase in NOI from our Same Park portfolio (defined below), a $6.7 million increase in NOI from our Non-Same Park portfolio (defined below), and $1.6 million lower preferred distributions in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the redemption of preferred stock in November 2021, partially offset by a decrease of $5.9 million in NOI generated from assets sold or held for sale, $6.4 million non-cash charge related to the above mentioned 2021 redemption of preferred stock, and $3.6 million charge for a state income tax provision due to differences between state and federal tax codes.\nOperating Results for 2020 and 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net income allocable to common stockholders was $124.6 million or $4.52 per diluted share, compared to $108.7 million or $3.95 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to an $11.0 million non-cash charge related to the redemption of preferred stock incurred in 2019 that did not reoccur in 2020, $10.6 million higher gain on sale of real estate facilities sold in 2020 than in 2019, $6.2 million lower preferred distributions in 2020 compared to 2019, and an increase of $3.9 million in NOI from our Non-Same Park portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of $15.1 million in NOI generated from assets sold or held for sale.\n \n\u200e\n Analysis of Net Income \nOur net income is comprised primarily of our real estate operations, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expense, interest and other income, interest and other expenses and gain on sale of real estate facilities.\nWe segregate our real estate activities into (i) same park operations, representing all operating properties acquired prior to January 1, 2019, comprising 25.1 million rentable square feet of our 27.7 million of rentable square feet at December 31, 2021 (the Same Park\u201d portfolio), (ii) non-same park operations, representing those facilities we own that were acquired after January 1, 2019 (the Non-Same Park\u201d portfolio), (iii) multifamily operations, and (iv) assets sold or held for sale comprising 0.7 million square feet of assets held for sale ( AHFS\u201d), the 2021 Assets Sold totaling 1.0 million square feet, the 2020 Assets sold totaling 153,000 square feet, and the 2019 Assets Sold totaling 1.3 million square feet.\nThe table below sets forth the various components of our net income (in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP.\u201d) The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nWe continually evaluate the estimates, judgments, and assumptions we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Changes in estimates, judgments, or assumptions could affect our financial position and our results of operations, which are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance.\nCritical Accounting Estimates:\nOur critical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with GAAP, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting estimates are described below.\nRecognition of real estate acquired: Generally, our acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate are accounted for as asset acquisitions and not business combinations because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). The accounting model for asset acquisitions requires that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. We estimate the fair value of land, buildings, intangible assets, and intangible liabilities for purposes of allocating purchase price.\nSuch estimates, which are determined with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists where appropriate, are based upon many assumptions and judgments, including, but not limited to:\n\uf0b7market rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate and intangible assets;\n\uf0b7building and material cost levels;\n\uf0b7estimated market rent levels;\n\uf0b7future revenue growth rates;\n\uf0b7future cash flows from the real estate and the existing customer base, and\n\uf0b7comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land transactions.\nIn calculating value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2021, we used discount rates ranging from 5.5% and 6.0% and a capitalization rate of 5.0%. Others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which could result in different depreciation and amortization expense, rental income, gains, and losses on sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible assets.\nWe completed acquisitions of two properties for a total purchase price of $148.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed. Refer to the Acquisitions\u201d section of Note 3 - Real estate facilities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\u200e\nImpairment of long-lived assets: For each reporting period, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets, including our rental properties, construction in progress, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee, and intangibles, to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. If triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.\nUpon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the asset is expected to be held and used. We may also adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.\nImpairment of real estate assets classified as held for sale: A property is classified as held for sale when all of the accounting criteria for a plan of sale have been met. Upon classification as held for sale, we recognize an impairment charge, if necessary, to lower the carrying amount of the real estate asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. The determination of fair value can involve significant judgments and assumptions. We develop key assumptions based on the following available factors: (i) contractual sales price, (ii) preliminary non-binding letters of intent, or (iii) other available comparable market information. If this information is not available, we use estimated replacement costs or estimated cash flow projections that utilize estimated discount and capitalization rates. These estimates are subject to uncertainty and therefore require significant judgment by us. We review all assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. Subsequently, as a result of our quarterly assessment, we may recognize an incremental impairment charge for any decrease in the asset's fair value less cost to sell. Conversely, we may recognize a gain for a subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, limited to the cumulative net loss previously recognized.\nThe analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets involves identification of indicators of impairment, projections of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair values or selling prices, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity. Others could come to materially different conclusions. In addition, we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment. Any unidentified impairment loss, or change in conclusions, could have a material adverse impact on our net income.\nThe evaluation for impairment and calculation of the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used involves consideration of factors and calculations that are different than the estimate of fair value of assets classified as held for sale. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.\n\u200e\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company is a fully-integrated, self-advised and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, acquires, and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex and low-rise suburban office space. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned and operated 27.7 million rentable square feet of commercial space in six states consisting of 97 parks and 666 buildings. The Company's properties are primarily located in major coastal markets that have experienced long-term economic growth. The Company also held a 95.0% interest in a joint venture entity which owns Highgate at The Mile, a 395-unit multifamily apartment complex located in Tysons, Virginia, and a 98.2% interest in a joint venture formed to develop Brentford at The Mile, a planned 411-unit multifamily apartment complex also located in Tysons, Virginia. Our strong and conservative capital structure allows us the flexibility to use debt and equity capital prudently to fund our growth, which allows us to acquire properties we believe will create long-term value. From time to time we sell properties which no longer fit the Company's strategic objectives.\nExisting Real Estate Facilities: The operating results of our existing real estate facilities are substantially influenced by demand for rental space within our properties and our markets, which impacts occupancy, rental rates, and capital expenditure requirements. We strive to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates and minimizing capital expenditures when market conditions allow, although the Company may decrease rental rates in markets where conditions require. Management's initiatives and strategies with respect to our existing real estate facilities, which include incentivizing our personnel to maximize the return on investment for each lease transaction and provide a superior level of service to our customers.\nAcquisitions of Real Estate Facilities: We seek to grow our portfolio through acquisitions of facilities generally consistent with the Company's focus on owning concentrated business parks with easy to configure space and in markets and product types with favorable long-term return potential.\nOn November 18, 2021, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 141,000 rentable square feet in Plano, Texas, for a total purchase price of $25.6 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of 5 buildings and was 97.3% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,400 to 25,000 square feet.\nOn September 1, 2021, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 718,000 rentable square feet in Grapevine, Texas, for a total purchase price of $123.3 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of 15 buildings and was 96.1% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 2,000 to 20,000 square feet.\nOn October 28, 2020, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 246,000 rentable square feet in Alexandria, Virginia, for a total purchase price of $46.6 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of three buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 7,000 to 75,000 square feet.\nOn January 10, 2020, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 73,000 rentable square feet in La Mirada, California, for a total purchase price of $13.5 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of five buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,200 to 3,000 square feet.\nOn December 20, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial-flex business park comprising approximately 79,000 rentable square feet in Santa Clara, California, for a total purchase price of $16.8 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of nine buildings and was 95.6% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 200 to 3,500 square feet.\nOn September 5, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 543,000 rentable square feet in Santa Fe Springs, California, for a total purchase price of $104.3 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of ten buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 5,000 to 288,000 square feet.\nOn April 18, 2019, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial business park comprising approximately 74,000 rentable square feet in Signal Hill, California, for a total purchase price of $13.8 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of eight buildings and was 98.4% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,200 to 8,000 square feet.\nWe continue to seek to acquire additional properties in our existing markets and generally in close proximity to our existing portfolio; however, there can be no assurance that we will acquire additional facilities that meet our risk-adjusted return and underwriting requirements.\nDevelopment or Redevelopment of Real Estate Facilities\nIn certain instances, we may seek to redevelop our existing real estate or develop new buildings on excess land parcels.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in the process of developing an approximately 83,000 square foot multi-tenant industrial building at our 212 Business Park located in Kent, Washington. As of December 31, 2021, $2.2 million of the estimated $15.4 million total development costs had been incurred and was reflected under land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. This construction project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in the process of developing an approximately 17,000 square foot multi-tenant industrial building at our Boca Commerce Park, located in Boca Raton, Florida. As of December 31, 2021, $1.1 million of the estimated $4.0 million total development costs had been incurred and was reflected under land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. This construction project is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nDuring 2021, we completed the development of an 83,000 square foot shallow-bay industrial building on an excess land parcel at our Freeport Business Park located in Irving, Texas for total development costs of $8.1 million. The asset was placed into service on March 1, 2021 and accordingly was reflected under real estate facilities, at cost on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021.\nThe Mile is an office and multifamily park we own which sits on 44.5 contiguous acres of land located in Tysons, Virginia. The park consists of 628,000 square feet of office space and a 395-unit multifamily apartment community we developed, Highgate at The Mile, which we completed in 2017 through a joint venture with the JV Partner. In 2019, we successfully rezoned The Mile allowing us to develop, at our election, up to 3,000 additional multifamily units and approximately 500,000 square feet of other commercial uses.\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into a new joint venture with the JV Partner for the purpose of developing a second multifamily property, Brentford at The Mile, a planned 411-unit multifamily apartment complex. Under the Brentford Joint Venture agreement, the Company has a 98.2% controlling interest and is the managing member with the JV Partner holding the remaining 1.8% limited partnership interest. We contributed the Brentford Parcel at a value of $18.5 million, for which we received equity contribution credit in the Brentford Joint Venture. Our cost basis in the Brentford Parcel was $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021.\nConstruction of Brentford at The Mile commenced in August 2020 and is anticipated to be completed over a period of 24 to 36 months at an estimated development cost of $110 million to $115 million, excluding land cost. As of December 31, 2021, the development cost incurred was $54.8 million, which is reflected in land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets along with our $5.1 million cost basis in the Brentford Parcel. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also recorded non-capitalizable demolition costs of $0.3 million in interest and other expense on our consolidated statements of income.\n\u200e\nWhile multifamily real estate was not previously a core asset class for us, we determined that multifamily real estate represents a unique opportunity and the highest and best use of the Brentford Parcel. Through joint ventures we have partnered with a local developer and operator of multifamily properties in order to leverage their development and operational expertise. The scope and timing of the future phases of development of The Mile are subject to a variety of uncertainties, including site plan approvals and building permits.\nWe consolidate both the joint venture that owns Highgate at The Mile and the joint venture that is developing Brentford at The Mile.\nSee Analysis of Net Income - Multifamily\u201d below and Note 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on Highgate at The Mile and Brentford at The Mile.\nSale of Real Estate Facilities: We may from time to time sell individual real estate facilities based on market conditions, fit with our existing portfolio, evaluation of long-term potential returns of markets or product types, or other reasons.\nOn December 30, 2021, we sold a 53,000 square foot industrial building located in Beltsville, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $4.5 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $3.2 million.\nOn December 29, 2021, we sold a 70,000 square foot industrial-flex building located in Irving, Texas, for net sale proceeds of $8.8 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $6.3 million.\nOn October 19, 2021, we sold a 371,000 square foot industrial-flex business park located in San Diego, California, for net sale proceeds of $311.1 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $301.3 million.\nOn September 17, 2021, we sold a 22,000 square foot industrial-flex building located in Irving, Texas, for net sale proceeds of $3.4 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $2.9 million.\nOn July 16, 2021, we sold a 244,000 square foot office business park located in Herndon, Virginia, for net sale proceeds of $40.5 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $27.0 million.\nOn June 17, 2021, we sold a 198,000 square foot office-oriented flex business park located in Chantilly, Virginia, for net sale proceeds of $32.6 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $19.2 million. (Collectively the 2021 Assets Sold\u201d).\nDuring 2021, we reclassified above-mentioned assets as properties held for sale, net, in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nOn September 16, 2020, we sold two industrial buildings totaling 40,000 square feet located in Redmond, Washington, which were subject to an eminent domain process for net sale proceeds of $11.4 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $7.7 million.\nOn January 7, 2020, we completed the sale of a single-tenant building totaling 113,000 square feet in Rockville, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $29.3 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $19.6 million. (Collectively the 2020 Assets Sold\u201d).\nOn October 8, 2019, we sold three business parks located in Rockville and Silver Springs, Maryland: Metro Park North, Meadow Business Park and WesTech Business Park. The parks, consisting of 28 buildings totaling approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet sold for net sale proceeds of $144.6 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $16.6 million. (Collectively the 2019 Assets Sold\u201d).\nWe have 702,000 rentable square feet of industrial-flex business park located in Irving, Texas, held for sale as of December 31, 2021 and expect to complete the sale of these assets during 2022. The operations of such facilities as well as the sold facilities mentioned above are presented below under assets sold or held for sale.\u201d\n\u200e\nCertain Factors that May Impact Future Results\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic: Starting in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in cessation, severe curtailment, or impairment of business activities in most sectors of the economy in all markets we operate in, due to governmental stay at home\u201d orders, risk mitigation procedures, and closure of businesses not considered to be essential.\u201d Since it remains unknown at this time how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue, particularly given the impact of existing and potential future variants, we cannot estimate how long these negative economic impacts will persist.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has entered into rent relief agreements consisting of $6.2 million of rent deferrals and $1.6 million of rent abatements. As of December 31, 2021, the 317 current customers that received rent relief account for 9.5% of rental income. Also as of December 31, 2021, the Company had collected $5.3 million of rent deferral repayment, representing 99.8% of the amounts scheduled to be repaid through December 2021. An additional $0.9 million of rent deferral repayment is scheduled to be repaid thereafter.\nThe Company also wrote off accounts receivable, net of recoveries and deferred rent receivables of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of February 18, 2022, the Company had open rent relief requests from approximately less than 1% of customers.\nOur ability to re-lease space as leases expire in a way that minimizes vacancy periods and maximizes market rental rates will depend upon market conditions in the specific submarkets in which each of our properties are located. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Company's future ability to grow or maintain existing occupancy levels, possible decreases in rental rates on new and renewal transactions, and the potential negative effect of additional rent deferrals, rent abatements, and customer defaults, we believe in some instances the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have adverse effects on rental income for 2022 and possibly beyond.\nImpact of Inflation: Inflation has significantly increased recently and a continued increase in inflation could adversely impact our future results. The Company continues to seek ways to mitigate its potential impact. A substantial portion of the Company's leases require customers to pay operating expenses, including real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance, as well as increases in common area expenses, which should partially reduce the Company's exposure to inflation.\nRegional Concentration: Our portfolio is concentrated in eight regions, in six states. We have chosen to concentrate in these regions because we believe they have characteristics which enable them to be competitive economically, such as above average population growth, job growth, higher education levels and personal income. Changes in economic conditions in these regions in the future could impact our future results.\nIndustry and Customer Concentrations: We seek to minimize the risk of industry or customer concentrations. As of December 31, 2021, excluding the assets held for sale, only three industry concentrations represented more than 10% of our annualized rental income as depicted in the following table.\nTable 6: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industry\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail, food, and automotive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction and engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Health services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electronics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home furnishings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance and financial services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aerospace/defense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Education\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2021, excluding the assets held for sale, leases from our top 10 customers comprised 10.3% of our annualized rental income with four customers representing more than 1% as depicted in the following table (in thousands).\nTable 7: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annualized\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customers\n</td> <td>Square Footage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Government\n</td> <td> 465,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amazon Inc.\n</td> <td> 543,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KZ Kitchen Cabinet & Stone\n</td> <td> 370,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Luminex Corporation\n</td> <td> 199,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ECS Federal, LLC\n</td> <td> 143,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lockheed Martin Corporation\n</td> <td> 124,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applied Materials, Inc.\n</td> <td> 173,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CentralColo, LLC\n</td> <td> 96,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Great Way Trading & Transportation, Inc.\n</td> <td> 177,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costco-Innovel Solutions LLC\n</td> <td> 180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td> 2,470,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 44,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________\n(1)For leases expiring prior to December 31, 2021, annualized rental income represents income to be received under existing leases from January 1, 2021 through the date of expiration.\nCustomer credit risk: Historically, we have experienced a low level of write-offs of uncollectible rents, with less than 0.4% of rental income written off in any single year from 2011-2019. As of December 31, 2021, our level of write-offs of uncollectible rents were 0.0%, which were below the 0.4% of rental income written off as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of February 18, 2022, we had 25,000 square feet of leased space occupied by one customer that is protected by Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which has no remaining lease value as the lease obligation ended during February 2022. From time to time, customers contact us, requesting early termination of their lease, reductions in space leased, or rent deferment or rent abatement, which we are not obligated to grant but will consider and grant under certain circumstances.\nNet Operating Income\nWe utilize net operating income ( NOI\u201d), a measure that is not defined in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate. We define NOI as rental income less Adjusted Cost of Operations. Adjusted Cost of Operations, a non-GAAP measure, represents cost of operations, excluding stock compensation, which can vary significantly period to period based upon the performance of the Company.\nWe believe NOI assists investors in analyzing the performance of our real estate by excluding (i) corporate overhead (i.e., general and administrative expense) because it does not relate to the direct operating performance of our real estate, (ii) depreciation and amortization expense because it does not accurately reflect changes in the fair value of our real estate, and (iii) stock compensation expense because this expense item can vary significantly from period to period and thus impact comparability across periods. The Company's calculation of NOI may not be comparable to those of other companies and should not be used as an alternative to performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nWe also report NOI on a basis which excludes non-cash rents that have been deferred or abated during the period, certain non-cash revenue items, including amortization of deferred rent receivable, in-place lease intangible, tenant improvement reimbursements, and lease incentives, and also excludes stock-compensation expense for employees whose compensation expense is recorded in cost of operations ( Cash NOI\u201d). We utilize Cash NOI to evaluate the cash flow performance of our properties and believe investors and analysts utilize this metric for the same purpose. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nSee Analysis of net income\u201d below for reconciliations of each of these measures to their closest analogous GAAP measure from our consolidated statements of income.\n\u200e\n Results of Operations \nOperating Results for 2021 and 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net income allocable to common stockholders was $393.1 million or $14.22 per diluted share, compared to $124.6 million or $4.52 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to a $332.6 million higher gain on sale of real estate facilities sold in 2021 than in 2020, an $18.3 million increase in NOI from our Same Park portfolio (defined below), a $6.7 million increase in NOI from our Non-Same Park portfolio (defined below), and $1.6 million lower preferred distributions in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the redemption of preferred stock in November 2021, partially offset by a decrease of $5.9 million in NOI generated from assets sold or held for sale, $6.4 million non-cash charge related to the above mentioned 2021 redemption of preferred stock, and $3.6 million charge for a state income tax provision due to differences between state and federal tax codes.\nOperating Results for 2020 and 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net income allocable to common stockholders was $124.6 million or $4.52 per diluted share, compared to $108.7 million or $3.95 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to an $11.0 million non-cash charge related to the redemption of preferred stock incurred in 2019 that did not reoccur in 2020, $10.6 million higher gain on sale of real estate facilities sold in 2020 than in 2019, $6.2 million lower preferred distributions in 2020 compared to 2019, and an increase of $3.9 million in NOI from our Non-Same Park portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of $15.1 million in NOI generated from assets sold or held for sale.\n \n\u200e\n Analysis of Net Income \nOur net income is comprised primarily of our real estate operations, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expense, interest and other income, interest and other expenses and gain on sale of real estate facilities.\nWe segregate our real estate activities into (i) same park operations, representing all operating properties acquired prior to January 1, 2019, comprising 25.1 million rentable square feet of our 27.7 million of rentable square feet at December 31, 2021 (the Same Park\u201d portfolio), (ii) non-same park operations, representing those facilities we own that were acquired after January 1, 2019 (the Non-Same Park\u201d portfolio), (iii) multifamily operations, and (iv) assets sold or held for sale comprising 0.7 million square feet of assets held for sale ( AHFS\u201d), the 2021 Assets Sold totaling 1.0 million square feet, the 2020 Assets sold totaling 153,000 square feet, and the 2019 Assets Sold totaling 1.3 million square feet.\nThe table below sets forth the various components of our net income (in thousands):\nTable 11: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same Park\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 392,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 369,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 22,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 369,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 366,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,318\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Same Park\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,745\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (395)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (611)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets sold or held for sale (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,816)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,675)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total rental"}
