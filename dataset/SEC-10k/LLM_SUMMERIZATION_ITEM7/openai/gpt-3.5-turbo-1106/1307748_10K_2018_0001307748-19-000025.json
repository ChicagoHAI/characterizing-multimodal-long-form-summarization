Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and its financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nInvenTrust Properties Corp. is a premier retail REIT that owns, leases, redevelops, acquires and manages open-air centers in key growth markets with favorable demographics. We seek to continue to execute our strategy to enhance our multi-tenant retail platform by acquiring the right centers in the right markets, driven by focused and disciplined capital allocation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to execute on our strategy by opportunistically disposing of properties not located in our core markets or where we believe the properties' values have been maximized. Our strategy is to redeploy the proceeds from these sales with a disciplined approach into strategic retail properties in our target markets. However, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities. As a result of this competition, the purchase prices for attractive and suitable assets may be significantly elevated and may adversely impact our ability to redeploy the proceeds from property sales for reinvestment. In addition, our disposition activity could continue to cause us to experience dilution in financial operating performance during the period in which we dispose of properties.\nIn evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, management focuses on the following financial and non-financial indicators, discussed in further detail herein:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Property NOI, which excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, provision for asset impairment, interest and dividends from corporate investments, gains (losses) from sales of properties, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, other income (expenses), interest expense, equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities, and realized and unrealized investment gains, net;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Modified NOI, which reflects property NOI exclusive of lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent and above/below market lease amortization);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>FFO Applicable to Common Shares, a supplemental non-GAAP measure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic and physical occupancy and rental rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Leasing activity and lease rollover;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Management of operating expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Management of general and administrative expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Debt maturities and leverage ratios; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Liquidity levels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMulti-tenant retail platform\nOur wholly owned, consolidated, and managed retail properties include grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers and necessity-based power centers.

Company entered into an amended and restated unsecured term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Term Loan Agreement\"). The Term Loan Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's prior term loan agreement in its entirety, provides for $400.0\nmillion in unsecured term loans. The Term Loan Agreement consists of two tranches of term loans: a $250.0 million 5-year tranche maturing on December 21, 2023 and a $150.0 million 5.5-year tranche maturing on June 21, 2024. Interest rates are based on the Company's total leverage ratio or, at the Company's one-time irrevocable option, upon the Company's achievement of an investment grade credit rating. Based upon the Company's total leverage ratio, as of December 31, 2018, all of the outstanding term loans bear interest at a rate of 1-Month LIBOR plus 1.20%. A fee is charged on the unused portion of the term loans at a rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.25% depending on the Company's total leverage ratio. Based on the Company's total leverage ratio as of December 31, 2018, the unused fee was 0.15%.\nAs of the closing date of the Term Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed $226.0 million under the 5-year tranche and $126.0 million under the 5.5-year tranche, of which $26.0 million from each tranche was used to pay off a $52.0 million outstanding unsecured revolving line of credit balance that was borrowed on July 12, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $24.0 million available for borrowing under the 5-year tranche and $24.0 million available for borrowing under the 5.5-year tranche.\nUnsecured revolving line of credit\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into a second amended and restated unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\"). The Revolving Credit Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's prior revolving credit agreement in its entirety, provides for a $350.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit. The Revolving Credit Agreement has a 4-year term maturing on December 21, 2022 with two six month extension options. Interest rates are based on the Company's total leverage ratio or, at the Company's one-time irrevocable option, upon achievement of an investment grade credit rating. Based upon the Company's total leverage ratio, as of December 31, 2018, outstanding revolving loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.05%. A facility fee accrues on the aggregate commitments at a rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.30% depending on the Company's total leverage ratio. Based on the Company's total leverage ratio as of December 31, 2018, the facility fee was 0.15%. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $350.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nJoint venture activity\nOn February 28, 2018, IAGM disposed of Bryant Square for a gross disposition price of $38.0 million and recognized a loss on the sale of this retail property of $3.9 million. On October 5, 2018, IAGM disposed of Victory Lakes Shopping Center for a gross disposition price of $53.0 million and recognized a loss on the sale of this retail property of $0.2 million. The Company's share of these aggregate losses was $2.3 million and is included in equity in (losses) earnings and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, IAGM recorded an aggregate provision for asset impairment of $3.7 million on three retail properties based on purchase contracts.\nOn June 30, 2018, IAGM entered into an extension to June 30, 2019 on a non-recourse mortgage loan with a balance of $15.1 million related to one retail property.\nOn November 2, 2018, IAGM entered into a senior secured term loan facility of $152.0 million to refinance its mortgages payable maturing in 2018. The senior secured term loan facility matures in November 2023 and contains two twelve-month extension options that IAGM may exercise upon payment of an extension fee equal to 0.10% of the commitment amount on the first day of the extension term and subject to certain other conditions. The senior secured term loan facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR daily floating rate plus 1.55% and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants. As a result of this refinance, no IAGM mortgages payable are recourse to the Company.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company evaluated its investment in Downtown Railyard Venture, LLC (\"DRV\") for potential other-than-temporary impairment due to a reduction in expected holding period. The Company obtained a third party independent appraisal to assist in establishing a range of estimated fair values of the underlying assets as of December 31, 2018. The Company's estimated fair value relating to its investment in DRV reflects the expected future cash distributions stemming from the value of the underlying assets at a point within that established range that management believes is most probable of realization, which, if liquidated, would result in an amount due to the Company based on the joint venture partners' respective waterfall distribution, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Downtown Railyard Venture, LLC, dated as of September 30, 2015. The Company selected the point within the range of estimated fair values established by the third-party independent appraisal that most appropriately reflects the underlying facts and circumstances of the investment, and as a result the Company recorded an other-than-temporary\nimpairment of $29,933 related to DRV on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDistribution rate\nOn March 2, 2018, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution paid in April 2018, from $0.0695 per share to $0.0716 per share, on an annualized basis.\nOn November 7, 2018, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution payable in April 2019, from $0.0716 per share to $0.0737, on an annualized basis.\nTender offer\nOn August 15, 2018, the Company announced and commenced a modified \"Dutch Auction\" tender offer (the \"2018 Offer\") to purchase for cash up to $75.0 million in value of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"Shares\"), subject to the Company's ability to increase the number of Shares accepted for payment in the 2018 Offer by up to 2% of the Company's outstanding Shares, without amending or extending the 2018 Offer in accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC. The Company exercised that option and increased the 2018 Offer by 10,706,774 shares, or $22.5 million, to avoid any proration for the stockholders tendering shares. The 2018 Offer expired on September 13, 2018.\nAs a result of the 2018 Offer, the Company accepted for purchase 46,559,289 shares of its common stock (which represented approximately 6.0% of the shares of common stock outstanding at the time) at a purchase price of $2.10 per share, for a cost of approximately $97.8 million, excluding fees and expenses as of December 31, 2018. Aggregate costs of $98.5 million were recorded as reductions to common stock and additional paid-in capital on the consolidated statement of equity for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent Activities\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated events and transactions occurring after December 31, 2018 through the date the financial statements were issued for recognition and disclosure purposes. On January 31, 2019, the Company acquired Commons at University Place, a 92,100 square foot neighborhood center located in the Raleigh-Cary, NC MSA, for a gross acquisition price of $23.3 million.\nCurrent Strategy and Outlook\nFor InvenTrust, the right properties include open-air grocery-anchored and certain necessity-based power centers, and the right markets mean those with above average growth in population, employment and wages. We believe these conditions create markets that are poised to experience increasing tenant demand for grocery-anchored and necessity-based retail centers, which will then position us to capitalize on potential future rent increases while enjoying sustained occupancy at our centers. Using these criteria, we have identified 10 to15 core markets within the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Denver, Houston, the greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas, suburban Washington, D.C., Miami, Orlando, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio and Tampa.\nWe have a coordinated program designed to increase rental income by maximizing re-development opportunities (which may have a mixed-use component) and identifying locations in our current multi-tenant retail platform where we can develop pad sites. We are continuing to work with our tenants to expand rentable square footage at select retail properties where demand warrants. In addition, due to our properties as both retail centers and community focal points, we are able to identify short-term and specialty leasing opportunities that generate revenue from areas of the properties which are typically vacant.\nOur grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers bring consumers to our well-located properties, while our larger-format necessity-based power center retailers continue to adapt their business models to embrace omni-channel retail and appeal to consumers' continuing focus on value. Our property management team is focused on enhancing the consumer shopping experience at our centers by maintaining strong tenant relationships, controlling expenses, and investing in sustainability programs at a number of our retail properties with initiatives such as LED lighting, trash recycling, water conservation and other programs to reduce energy consumption and expenses.\nIn addition, our leasing staff continues to focus on leasing space at our retail properties at favorable rental rates while establishing a more favorable tenant mix and identifying complementary uses to maximize tenant performance. We believe our strong locations have allowed and will continue to allow us to backfill the vacancies created by such tenants.\nWe believe that the continuing refinement of our multi-tenant retail platform will position us for future success and put us in a position to evaluate and ultimately execute on potential strategic transactions aimed at achieving liquidity for our stockholders\nin the long term. While we believe in our ability to execute on our plan, the speed of its completion is uncertain and may be shortened or extended by external and macroeconomic factors including, among others, interest rate movements, local, regional, national and global economic performance, competitive factors, the impact of e-commerce on the retail industry, future retailer store closings, retailer bankruptcies, and government policy changes.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following section describes and compares our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Other property income\nRental income consists of basic monthly rent, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of acquired above and below market leases and percentage of sales rental income recorded pursuant to tenant leases. Tenant recovery income consists of contractual reimbursements for real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs, management fees, and insurance costs. Other property income consists of lease termination fees and other miscellaneous property income.\nRental, tenant recovery, and other property income decreased $9.3 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017, primarily as a result of a decrease of $41.5 million related to the disposition of 24 retail properties since January 1, 2017. This decrease was offset by increases of $23.7 million from eight retail properties acquired in 2017, $6.5 million from the acquisitions of three retail properties and two retail parcels adjacent to two existing retail properties in 2018, and $2.0 million from 47 retail properties classified as same-property.\nProperty operating and Depreciation and amortization expense\nProperty operating expenses consist of recurring repair and maintenance, utilities, and insurance (most of which are recoverable from the tenant).\nAggregate property operating and depreciation and amortization expenses increased $4.4 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017 as a result of $15.2 million related to eight retail properties acquired in 2017, $5.4 million from 47 retail properties classified as same-property, and $5.1 million from the acquisition of three retail properties and two retail parcels adjacent to two existing retail properties in 2018. These increases were offset by $21.3 million in total property operating and depreciation and amortization expenses related to the disposition of 24 retail properties since January 1, 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $7.4 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of the Company's smaller and more focused operating platform, a continued focus on managing general and administrative expenses, and a decrease in compensation expenses resulting from reductions in our workforce.\nReal estate taxes\nReal estate taxes decreased $0.4 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of a decrease in real estate tax expense of $7.3 million related to the disposition of 24 retail properties since January 1, 2017. This decrease was offset by increases in real estate tax expense of $4.6 million from eight retail properties acquired in 2017, $1.7 million from 47 retail properties classified as same-property, and $0.6 million from the acquisition of three retail properties and two retail parcels adjacent to two existing retail properties in 2018.\nProvision for asset impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company identified three retail properties that had reductions in their expected holding periods. As a result, the Company recorded an additional provision for asset impairment of $0.8 million on the disposal of one retail property and recorded a provision for asset impairment of $2.7 million on two retail properties as a result of the fair value (the agreed upon price with the buyers) in the sales contracts being lower than the properties' carrying values during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company identified six retail properties that had reductions in their expected holding periods. As a result, the Company recorded a provision for asset impairment of $5.4 million on one retail property based on a 10-year discounted cash flow model and $22.4 million on five retail properties as a result of the fair value (the agreed upon price with the buyers) in the sales contracts being lower than the properties' carrying values.\nInterest and dividend income\nInterest and dividend income decreased $2.2 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of divesting of substantially all the Company's marketable securities portfolio. The Company's investment in marketable securities of $183.9 million as of January 1, 2017 was substantially liquidated prior to December 31, 2018.\nGain on sale and transfer of investment properties, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a gain of $93.1 million related to the sale of 16 retail properties, a gain on transfer of assets, net, of $1.8 million related to the surrender of Stonecrest Marketplace and Bellerive Plaza to the lender (in satisfaction of non-recourse debt), and a gain of $0.2 million related to the completion of a partial condemnation at one retail property.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a gain of $20.6 million related to the sale of seven retail properties, a gain of $3.1 million on the sale of two single-user outparcels, a gain on sale of $0.5 million related to the completion of a partial condemnation at one retail property, and a loss on transfer of assets, net, of $0.1 million related to the surrender of Intech Retail to the lender (in satisfaction of non-recourse debt).\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized gains on extinguishment of debt of $10.8 million related to the surrender of Stonecrest Marketplace and $1.7 million related to the surrender of Bellerive Plaza (both to their lenders in\nsatisfaction of non-recourse debt). In addition, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million related to the loan pay-offs on four retail properties at disposition (primarily as a result of $3.1 million in prepayment penalties).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.9 million related to the surrender of Intech Retail (in satisfaction of non-recourse debt) and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.04 million related to the loan pay-offs on two retail properties at disposition.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense decreased $5.2 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of decreases in interest expense of $3.5 million related to three retail properties surrendered to the lender (in satisfaction of non-recourse debt) since January 1, 2017, a decrease of $2.8 million related to the pay-offs and deed-in-lieu of mortgage debt from the disposal of six retail properties since January 1, 2017, and a decrease of $1.0 million related to the pay-off of one mortgage in 2018. These decreases were offset by a $2.1 million increase in interest expense when comparing the year ended December 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017 as a result of increasing LIBOR rates since January 1, 2017 related to the Company's variable rate unsecured term loans.\nEquity in losses and impairment of unconsolidated entities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company evaluated its investment in DRV for potential other-than-temporary impairment due to a reduction in expected holding period. The Company obtained a third party independent appraisal to assist in establishing a range of estimated fair values of the underlying assets as of December 31, 2018. The Company's estimated fair value relating to its investment in DRV reflects the expected future cash distributions stemming from the value of the underlying assets at a point within that established range that management believes is most probable of realization, which, if liquidated, would result in an amount due to the Company based on the joint venture partners' respective waterfall distributions. The Company selected the point within the range of estimated fair values established by the third-party independent appraisal that most appropriately reflects the underlying facts and circumstances of the investment, and as a result the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $29,933 related to DRV on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRealized and unrealized investment gains (losses) and (impairment), net\nRealized and unrealized investment gains (losses) and (impairment), net, decreased $46.3 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of divesting of substantially all the Company's marketable securities portfolio during 2017.\nNet income from discontinued operations\nNet income from discontinued operations of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily related to the gain of $10.1 million from the sale of the Company's remaining non-core office property, Worldgate Plaza, and was offset by interest expense, income taxes, and other miscellaneous income related to Worldgate Plaza of $6.7 million.\nNet operating income\nWe evaluate the performance of our wholly owned and consolidated retail properties based on NOI and modified NOI. Modified NOI reflects the income from operations excluding lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent and above/below market lease amortization). We believe NOI, modified NOI, same-property modified NOI, and modified NOI from other investment properties, which are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, provide added comparability across periods when evaluating the financial condition and operating performance that is not readily apparent from \"Operating income\" or \"Net income\" in accordance with GAAP.\nComparison of same-property results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nA total of 47 wholly owned retail properties met our same-property criteria for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Modified NOI from other investment properties in the table below for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 includes retail properties that did not meet our same-property criteria, including retail properties sold and/or acquired in 2018 and 2017. The following table represents the reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to same-property modified NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

income\nRental, tenant recovery, and other property income increased $9.2 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in rental, tenant recovery, and other property income of $40.5 million related to properties acquired prior to December 31, 2017 and was offset by a decrease in rental, tenant recovery, and other property income of $31.3 million related to properties sold prior to December 31, 2018. The decrease of $1.5 million in other property income when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 is a primarily a result of termination fee income received from two former tenants totaling $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. No such termination fee income was received during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProperty operating and Depreciation and amortization expense\nProperty operating expenses and depreciation and amortization increased $12.0 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in property operating and depreciation and amortization expense of $27.9 million related to properties acquired prior to December 31, 2017 and was offset by a decrease in property operating and depreciation and amortization expense of $15.9 million related to properties sold prior to December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $6.4 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of the Company's smaller and more focused operating platform, a continued focus on managing general and administrative expenses, and a decrease in compensation expenses resulting from reductions in our workforce.\nReal estate taxes\nReal estate taxes remained flat when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016. Real estate taxes increased $5.0 million related to properties acquired prior to December 31, 2017 and decreased $5.2 million related to properties sold prior to December 31, 2018.\nProvision for asset impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company identified six retail properties that had reductions in their expected holding periods. As a result, the Company recorded a provision for asset impairment of $5.4 million on one retail property based on a 10-year discounted cash flow model and $22.4 million on five retail properties as a result of the fair value (the agreed upon price with the buyers) in the sales contracts being lower than the properties' carrying values.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company identified three retail properties that had reductions in their expected holding periods. As a result, the Company recorded a provision for asset impairment of $2.8 million on one retail property based on a 10-year discounted cash flow model and $8.4 million on two retail properties as a result of the fair value (the agreed upon price with the buyers) in the sales contracts being lower than the properties' carrying values.\nInterest and dividend income\nInterest and dividend income decreased $7.6 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of divesting of substantially all the Company's marketable securities portfolio. The Company's investment in marketable securities decreased $179.1 million, from $183.9 million as of December 31, 2016, to $4.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nGain on sale and transfer of investment properties, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a gain of $20.6 million related to the sale of seven retail properties, a gain of $3.1 million on the sale of two single-user outparcels, a gain of $0.5 million on the completion of a partial condemnation at one retail property, and a loss on transfer of assets, net, of $0.1 million related to the surrender of Intech Retail to the lender (in satisfaction of non-recourse debt).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a gain of $117.8 million related to the sale of 28 retail properties.\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.9 million related to the surrender of Intech Retail to the lender (in satisfaction of non-recourse debt) and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.04 million related to the loan pay-offs on two retail properties at disposition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt, net, of $10.5 million primarily as a result of the pay-off of debt during the year on 20 retail properties and the pay-off of debt at disposal of 19 retail properties.\nOther (expense) income\nOther (expense) income decreased $2.6 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the $0.6 million portion of the final settlement paid related to a legal claim. See \"Item 8. Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements. Other income of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $0.9 million received related to leases terminated as part of a former tenant's bankruptcy. No such income was received during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased $14.0 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily a result of the pay-off of mortgage debt during the year on 20 retail properties and the pay-off of mortgage debt at disposal of 19 retail properties during the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted in a decrease to interest expense of $19.2 million. These decreases in mortgage debt were offset by an increase of $150.0 million on the unsecured term loan in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in an increase to interest expense of $3.4 million, and the assumption of mortgage debt of $41.7 million on one retail property acquired in 2017, which resulted in an increase to interest expense of $1.8 million.\nEquity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated entities\nEquity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated entities decreased $10.1 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 primarily as the result of distributions received in 2016 in excess of the investments' carrying value by $5.2 million and a decrease in equity in earnings recognized from one joint venture of $2.4 million. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, a provision for asset impairment of $4.7 million was recognized on a retail property in the IAGM joint venture, resulting in a decrease to the Company's share of equity in earnings of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRealized and unrealized investment gains (losses) and (impairment), net\nRealized and unrealized investment gains (losses) and (impairment), net, increased $41.5 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of divesting of substantially all the Company's marketable securities portfolio during 2017, which decreased the Company's marketable securities by $179.1 million. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment on one available-for-sale security of $1.3 million.\nNet income from discontinued operations\nNet income from discontinued operations of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily related to the gain of $10.1 million from the sale of Worldgate Plaza and was offset by interest expense, income taxes, and other miscellaneous income related to Worldgate Plaza of $6.7 million. Net income from discontinued operations of $133.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily related to the gain of $236.3 million from the sale of University House and was offset by provision for asset impairment of $106.5 million, of which $76.6 million was related to Highlands and $29.9 million related to Worldgate Plaza.\nNet operating income\nComparison of same-property results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nA total of 39 wholly owned retail properties met our same-property criteria for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Modified NOI from other investment properties in the table below for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 includes retail properties that did not meet our same-property criteria, including retail properties sold and/or acquired in 2018, 2017, and 2016. The following table represents the reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to same-property modified NOI for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 142:

comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in real estate tax expense of $2.0 million, as a result of a prior year adjustment of real estate tax expense of $1.1 million (which was offset by $1.0 million of tenant recovery income), and lower property level compensation expenses of $0.8 million as a result of being a smaller, more focused company with a smaller operating platform.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are required in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, evaluating the impairment of long-lived assets, allocating the purchase price of acquired assets, determining the fair value of debt and evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable. We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nConsolidation\nWe evaluate our investments in limited liability companies (\"LLCs\") and limited partnerships (\"LPs\") to determine whether each such entity may be a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). If the entity is a VIE, the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary must be made. The primary beneficiary determination is based on a qualitative assessment as to whether we have (i) power to direct significant activities of the VIE and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We will consolidate a VIE if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, as defined in ASC 810, Consolidation. The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary as defined in ASC 810, or the entity is not a VIE and we do not have control, but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. Investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, as appropriate. Our ability to correctly assess control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nReal Estate\nThe Company evaluates the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.\nWe allocate the purchase price of real estate to land, building, other building improvements, tenant improvements, and intangible assets and liabilities (such as the value of above- and below-market leases, in-place leases and origination costs associated with in-place leases). The values of above- and below-market leases are recorded as intangible assets, net, and intangible liabilities, net, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets, and are amortized as either a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) or an increase (in the case of below-market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated tenant lease. The values associated with in-place leases are recorded in intangible assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income over the remaining lease term.\nThe difference between the contractual rental rates and our estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases, including below-market renewal options, if reasonably assured. For the amortization period, the remaining term of leases with renewal options at terms below market reflect the assumed exercise of such below-market renewal options, if reasonably assured.\nWe perform, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, the following procedures for properties we acquire:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimate the value of the property \"as if vacant\" as of the acquisition date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allocate the value of the property among land, building, and other building improvements and determine the associated useful life for each;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Calculate the value and associated life of above- and below-market leases on a tenant-by-tenant basis.

The timing of payment and satisfaction of performance obligations typically occur simultaneously on the disposition date upon transfer of the property's ownership, at which point we recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of consideration transferred and the carrying amount of the investment property.\nHistorically, we have recognized gains and losses from the sale of investment property at the time of sale using the full accrual method based on the following criteria in Topic 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment - Real Estate Sales: sales were consummated; usual risks and rewards of ownership were transferred to buyers; we had no substantial continuing involvement with the property; and any sales related receivables were not subject to future subordination. If these criteria were not all met, we deferred the gains and recognized them when the criteria were met. If the full accrual method was not followed, we used either the installment, deposit or cost recovery methods, as appropriate in the circumstances.\nInvestment Properties Held for Sale\nIn determining whether to classify an investment property as held for sale, we consider whether: (i) management has committed to a plan to sell the investment property; (ii) the investment property is available for immediate sale, in its present condition; (iii) we have initiated a program to locate a buyer; (iv) we believe that the sale of the investment property is probable; (v) we have received a significant non-refundable deposit for the purchase of the property; (vi) we are actively marketing the investment property for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its estimated fair value; and (vii) actions required for us to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made to the plan.\nIf all of the above criteria are met, we classify the investment property as held for sale. When these criteria are met, we suspend depreciation on the investment properties held for sale, including depreciation for tenant improvements and additions, as well as on the amortization of acquired in-place and above/below-market lease intangibles. The properties held for sale and associated liabilities are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Such properties are recorded at the lesser of the carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell. Additionally, if the sale represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's results and operations, the operations are classified on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of the respective long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable, such as a reduction in the expected holding period of the asset. If it is determined that the carrying value is not recoverable because the expected undiscounted cash flows do not exceed carrying value, we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value. The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on our continuous process of analyzing each property and reviewing assumptions about uncertain inherent factors, as well as the economic condition of the property at a particular point in time.\nThe use of projected future cash flows and related holding period is based on assumptions that are consistent with the estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. However, assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions and our ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to the impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in additional impairment of the properties.\nPeriodically, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated entities may be other than temporarily impaired. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. The estimated fair value of the investment is generally derived from the cash flows generated from the underlying real property investments of the investee.\nReal Estate Capitalization and Depreciation\nReal estate is reflected at cost less accumulated depreciation within investment property on the consolidated balance sheets. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight line method. Buildings within investment property on the consolidated balance sheets is depreciated based upon an estimated useful life of 30 years, and 5-15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment and site improvements within other improvements in building and other improvements on the consolidated balance sheets.\nTenant improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the life of the tenant improvement or the lease term as a component of depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated statements of operations.\nDirect and indirect costs that are clearly related to the construction and improvements of investment properties are capitalized. Costs incurred for property taxes and insurance are capitalized during periods in which activities necessary to get the property ready for its intended use are in progress. Interest costs are also capitalized during such periods. Additionally, we treat investments accounted for by the equity method as assets qualifying for interest capitalization, if significant, provided (i) the investee has activities in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations and (ii) the investee's activities include qualifying expenditures.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe commence revenue recognition on leases based on a number of factors. In most cases, revenue recognition under a lease begins when the lessee takes possession of, or controls the physical use of, the leased asset. Generally, this occurs on the lease commencement date. The determination of who is the owner, for accounting purposes, of the tenant improvements determines the nature of the leased asset and when revenue recognition under a lease begins. If we are the owner, for accounting purposes, of the tenant improvements, then the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition begins when the lessee takes possession of the finished space, typically when the improvements are substantially complete. If we conclude we are not the owner, for accounting purposes, of the tenant improvements (the lessee is the owner), then the leased asset is the unimproved space and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives which reduce revenue recognized over the term of the lease. In these circumstances, we begin revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space to construct their own improvements. We consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes. These factors include:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the uniqueness of the improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The determination of who owns the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, is subject to significant judgment. In making that determination, we consider all of the above factors. No one factor, however, is determinative.\nRental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The cumulative difference between rental income earned and recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease agreements is recorded as deferred rent receivable and is included as a component of accounts and rents receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nBased on the terms of certain leases, we may pay all operating expenses and are subsequently reimbursed by the tenant for their pro rata share of recoverable expenses paid, including real estate taxes, special assessments, insurance, utilities, common area maintenance, management fees, and certain building repairs. We record tenant recovery income to the extent the operating expenses are recoverable under the terms of the lease.\nWe record lease termination income when there is a signed termination agreement, all of the conditions of the termination agreement have been met, the tenant is no longer occupying the property and termination income amounts due are considered collectible.\nWe defer recognition of contingent rental income (i.e. percentage/excess rent) until the specified target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved.\nIncome Taxes\nWe qualify and have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for federal income tax purposes commencing with the tax year ended December 31, 2005. Since we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to its stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, and may in the future elect to treat newly formed subsidiaries, as TRSs pursuant to the Code. Among other activities, TRSs may participate in non-real estate related activities and/or perform non-customary services for tenants and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital expenditures and re-development activity\nThe following table summarizes capital resources used through development, re-development and leasing activities at the Company's retail properties owned during the year ended December 31, 2018. These costs are classified as cash used in capital expenditures and tenant improvements on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements from cash flows from operations, distributions from our joint venture investments, sales of our retail properties and available capacity on our unsecured term loans and revolving credit agreements.\nOn August 15, 2018, we announced and commenced the 2018 Offer. As a result of the 2018 Offer, we accepted for purchase 46,559,289 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $2.10 per share, for a cost of approximately $97.8 million, excluding fees and expenses.\nLong-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur objectives are to maximize revenue generated by our multi-tenant retail platform, to further enhance the value of our retail properties to produce attractive current yield and long-term risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders, and to generate sustainable and predictable cash flow from our operations to distribute to our stockholders. We are seeking to increase our operating cash flows over time through the execution of our strategy.\nOur Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution paid in April 2018. As we execute on our retail strategy, our Board has been and will continue to evaluate our distribution rate and, if the Board deems appropriate, adjust the rate to take into account our progress in refining and balancing our multi-tenant retail platform. See \"Part I, Item 1A.Risk Factors - There is no assurance that we will be able to continue paying cash distributions or that distributions will increase over time.\"\nOur primary sources and uses of capital are as follows:\nSources\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating cash flows from our real estate investments, which consists of our retail properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distributions from our joint venture investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Proceeds from sales of properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Proceeds from mortgage loan borrowings on properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Proceeds from corporate borrowings; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash and cash equivalents.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Uses\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>To pay our operating expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>To make distributions to our stockholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>To service or pay down our debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>To fund capital expenditures and leasing related costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>To invest in properties and portfolios of properties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>To fund development or re-development investments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>To repurchase our common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding equity through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities. Such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions of Real Estate Investments\nIn 2018, we acquired three retail properties, including one retail property classified as a consolidated VIE, and the acquisition of two retail parcels adjacent to two existing retail properties. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired eight retail properties, including two retail properties classified as consolidated VIEs. These acquisitions were funded with available cash, disposition proceeds, and mortgage indebtedness. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we invested net cash of approximately $220.8 million and $589.4 million, respectively, for these acquisitions.\nIn 2018, we disposed of 16 retail properties, including the surrender of two properties to their respective lenders in satisfaction of non-recourse debt, and completed a partial condemnation at one retail property for an aggregate gross disposition price of $466.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we disposed of eight retail properties, including the surrender of one property to the lender (in satisfaction of non-recourse debt), one non-core office property, two single-user outparcels, and completed a partial condemnation at one retail property for an aggregate gross disposition price of $244.1 million.\nDistributions\nIn 2018, we declared cash distributions to our stockholders totaling $53.8 million and paid cash distributions of $54.2 million. As we execute on our retail strategy, our Board has been and expects to continue evaluating our distribution rate on a periodic basis. See \"Part I. Item 1. Business - Current Strategy and Outlook\" for more information regarding our retail strategy. The following table presents a historical summary of distributions declared, paid and reinvested.

Cash provided by operating activities increased $6.5 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2018 to the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of the acquisition of three retail properties and two retail parcels adjacent to two existing retail properties in 2018 and the acquisition of eight retail properties in 2017 now contributing a full year of operational cash flows. These increases were offset by the disposal of 16 and 7 retail properties during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCash provided by operating activities of $133.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was generated primarily from operating income from property operations and operating distributions from unconsolidated entities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $15.0 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of the disposition of 35 retail and two non-core properties since January 1, 2016, the spin-off of Highlands on April 28, 2016, the sale of University House on June 21, 2016, and a decrease of $2.6 million in operating distributions from\nunconsolidated entities. Cash provided by properties included in the spin-off of Highlands and the sale of University House was $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These decreases were offset by the acquisition of 16 retail properties since January 1, 2016.\nInvesting activities\nCash provided by investing activities of $175.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily generated by net proceeds from sale of investment properties of $430.5 million from the disposal of 16 retail properties during the year ended December 31, 2018. These proceeds were offset by cash used for acquisitions of investment properties of $205.5 million, capital expenditures and tenant improvements of $27.2 million, and acquired in-place and market lease intangibles, net, of $15.4 million related to the acquisition of three retail properties and two retail parcels adjacent to two existing retail properties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCash used in investing activities of $209.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of cash used in the acquisition of eight retail properties, including $539.2 million for the purchase of investment properties and $50.2 million from acquired in-place and market lease intangibles, net. In addition, $15.9 million of cash was used in capital expenditures and tenant improvements during the year ended December 31, 2017. These investing activities were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of seven retail properties, one non-core property, and an outparcel of land aggregating $233.7 million and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $171.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash provided by investing activities was $1,078.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by investing activities from the sale of University House was $1,230.4 million. In addition, cash was provided from the sale of 28 retail properties and one non-core property aggregating $353.9 million, offset by the cash used in development projects of $53.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash was used in eight acquisitions, including $423.6 million for the purchase of retail properties and $25.6 million from acquired in-place and market lease intangibles, net.\nFinancing activities\nCash used in financing activities of $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily the result of pay-offs of debt, debt prepayment penalties, principal payments of mortgage debt, and payment of loan fees and other deposits aggregating $231.9 million, the 2018 Offer of $98.4 million, and distributions paid of $54.2 million. These cash outlays were offset by cash provided by proceeds from debt of $179.3 million related to the Term Loan Agreement.\nCash used in financing activities of $159.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of pay-offs of debt, debt prepayment penalties, principal payments of mortgage debt, and payment of loan fees and other deposits aggregating $105.8 million, including the loan pay-off of the disposed non-core property of $60.0 million and $44.0 million used to pay off loans of three retail properties upon disposition, and to pay distributions of $53.4 million.\nCash used in financing activities of $1,013.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of cash used for pay-offs of debt, debt prepayment penalties, principal payments of mortgage debt, and payment of loan fees and other deposits of $1,094.2 million, cash used for the repurchasing of shares of $241.0 million, distributions paid of $98.6 million, cash contributed to Highlands at spin-off of $27.1 million, and was offset by proceeds from debt of $449.3 million.\nWe consider all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements with a maturity of three months or less, at the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions. The combined account balances at one or more institutions generally exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance coverage. As a result, there is what we believe to be insignificant credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have obligations related to our mortgage loans, term loan, and credit facility as described in \"Note 9. Debt\" in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we have one retail property subject to a long term ground lease where a third party owns the underlying land and has leased it to us for our use. The unconsolidated entities in which we have an investment have third party mortgage debt of $275.3 million at December 31, 2018, as described in \"Note 6. Investment in Consolidated\nand Unconsolidated Entities\" in the consolidated financial statements.

With respect to current economic conditions and governmental fiscal policy, inflation may become a greater risk. Our leases typically require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. By sharing these costs with our tenants, we may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. A portion of our leases also include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on a tenant's gross sales above predetermined levels or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the Consumer Price Index or similar inflation indices. Furthermore, many of our leases are for terms of 10 years or less, allowing us to seek to adjust rents upon renewal.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of InvenTrust Properties Corp.'s operations and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and its financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nInvenTrust Properties Corp. is a premier retail REIT that owns, leases, redevelops, acquires and manages open-air centers in key growth markets with favorable demographics. We seek to continue to execute our strategy to enhance our multi-tenant retail platform by acquiring the right centers in the right markets, driven by focused and disciplined capital allocation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to execute on our strategy by opportunistically disposing of properties not located in our core markets or where we believe the properties' values have been maximized. Our strategy is to redeploy the proceeds from these sales with a disciplined approach into strategic retail properties in our target markets. However, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities. As a result of this competition, the purchase prices for attractive and suitable assets may be significantly elevated and may adversely impact our ability to redeploy the proceeds from property sales for reinvestment. In addition, our disposition activity could continue to cause us to experience dilution in financial operating performance during the period in which we dispose of properties.\nIn evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, management focuses on the following financial and non-financial indicators, discussed in further detail herein:\n \u2022 Property NOI, which excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, provision for asset impairment, interest and dividends from corporate investments, gains (losses) from sales of properties, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, other income (expenses), interest expense, equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities, and realized and unrealized investment gains, net; \n \u2022 Modified NOI, which reflects property NOI exclusive of lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent and above/below market lease amortization); \n \u2022 FFO Applicable to Common Shares, a supplemental non-GAAP measure; \n \u2022 Cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP; \n \u2022 Economic and physical occupancy and rental rates; \n \u2022 Leasing activity and lease rollover; \n \u2022 Management of operating expenses; \n \u2022 Management of general and administrative expenses; \n \u2022 Debt maturities and leverage ratios; and \n \u2022 Liquidity levels. \nMulti-tenant retail platform\nOur wholly owned, consolidated, and managed retail properties include grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers and necessity-based power centers. As of December 31, 2018, we manage 71 retail properties, with a GLA of approximately 12.1 million square feet, which includes one retail property classified as a consolidated VIE, with a GLA of approximately 125,000 square feet, and 13 retail properties with a GLA of approximately 2.6 million square feet owned through the Company's ownership interest in IAGM. The following table summarizes our multi-tenant retail platform as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. \nMulti-tenant retail platform summary by center type\nThe following tables summarize our multi-tenant retail platform, by center type, as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. \n\nMulti-tenant retail platform by same-property\nThe following table summarizes the GLA, economic occupancy and ABR per square foot of the properties included in our multi-tenant retail platform classified as same-property for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, properties classified as same-property have been owned for the entirety of both periods presented and exclude properties sold and/or acquired in 2018 and 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, properties classified as same-property have been owned for the entirety of both periods presented and exclude properties sold and/or acquired in 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\n\nLeasing Activity\nThe following table summarizes the leasing activity for leases that were executed during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to expiring or expired leases for the same or previous tenant for renewals and the same unit for new leases at the 71 retail properties in our multi-tenant retail platform. We had GLA totaling 1,420,458 square feet expiring in 2018, of which 998,045 square feet was rolled over. This achieved a retention rate of approximately 70.3%. \n (a) Comparable leases are leases that meet all of the following criteria: terms greater than one year, unit was vacant one year or less prior to occupancy, square footage of unit remains unchanged or within 10% of prior unit square footage, and has a rent structure consistent with the previous tenant. \n (b) Non-comparable leases are not included in totals. \nHighlights for the year ended December 31, 2018\nAcquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to execute on our strategy to enhance our multi-tenant retail platform with the following acquisitions of retail properties, all of which are classified as community or neighborhood centers, in our core markets:\n\n (a) As defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget. \n (b) This retail property has been classified as a consolidated VIE.  Dispositions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to execute on our strategy to opportunistically dispose of properties not located in our core markets or where we believe the properties' values have been maximized. The following retail properties were disposed of during the year ended December 31, 2018: \n (a) On March 21, 2018, the Company surrendered Stonecrest Marketplace to the lender in satisfaction of non-recourse debt. \n (b) The Company completed a partial condemnation at this retail property. \n (c) On June 26, 2018, the Company surrendered Bellerive Plaza to the lender in satisfaction of non-recourse debt.  Credit agreements\nUnsecured term loans\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated unsecured term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Term Loan Agreement\"). The Term Loan Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's prior term loan agreement in its entirety, provides for $400.0\nmillion in unsecured term loans. The Term Loan Agreement consists of two tranches of term loans: a $250.0 million 5-year tranche maturing on December 21, 2023 and a $150.0 million 5.5-year tranche maturing on June 21, 2024. Interest rates are based on the Company's total leverage ratio or, at the Company's one-time irrevocable option, upon the Company's achievement of an investment grade credit rating. Based upon the Company's total leverage ratio, as of December 31, 2018, all of the outstanding term loans bear interest at a rate of 1-Month LIBOR plus 1.20%. A fee is charged on the unused portion of the term loans at a rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.25% depending on the Company's total leverage ratio. Based on the Company's total leverage ratio as of December 31, 2018, the unused fee was 0.15%.\nAs of the closing date of the Term Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed $226.0 million under the 5-year tranche and $126.0 million under the 5.5-year tranche, of which $26.0 million from each tranche was used to pay off a $52.0 million outstanding unsecured revolving line of credit balance that was borrowed on July 12, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $24.0 million available for borrowing under the 5-year tranche and $24.0 million available for borrowing under the 5.5-year tranche.\nUnsecured revolving line of credit\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into a second amended and restated unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\"). The Revolving Credit Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's prior revolving credit agreement in its entirety, provides for a $350.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit. The Revolving Credit Agreement has a 4-year term maturing on December 21, 2022 with two six month extension options. Interest rates are based on the Company's total leverage ratio or, at the Company's one-time irrevocable option, upon achievement of an investment grade credit rating. Based upon the Company's total leverage ratio, as of December 31, 2018, outstanding revolving loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.05%. A facility fee accrues on the aggregate commitments at a rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.30% depending on the Company's total leverage ratio. Based on the Company's total leverage ratio as of December 31, 2018, the facility fee was 0.15%. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $350.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nJoint venture activity\nOn February 28, 2018, IAGM disposed of Bryant Square for a gross disposition price of $38.0 million and recognized a loss on the sale of this retail property of $3.9 million. On October 5, 2018, IAGM disposed of Victory Lakes Shopping Center for a gross disposition price of $53.0 million and recognized a loss on the sale of this retail property of $0.2 million. The Company's share of these aggregate losses was $2.3 million and is included in equity in (losses) earnings and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, IAGM recorded an aggregate provision for asset impairment of $3.7 million on three retail properties based on purchase contracts.\nOn June 30, 2018, IAGM entered into an extension to June 30, 2019 on a non-recourse mortgage loan with a balance of $15.1 million related to one retail property.\nOn November 2, 2018, IAGM entered into a senior secured term loan facility of $152.0 million to refinance its mortgages payable maturing in 2018. The senior secured term loan facility matures in November 2023 and contains two twelve-month extension options that IAGM may exercise upon payment of an extension fee equal to 0.10% of the commitment amount on the first day of the extension term and subject to certain other conditions. The senior secured term loan facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR daily floating rate plus 1.55% and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants. As a result of this refinance, no IAGM mortgages payable are recourse to the Company.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company evaluated its investment in Downtown Railyard Venture, LLC (\"DRV\") for potential other-than-temporary impairment due to a reduction in expected holding period. The Company obtained a third party independent appraisal to assist in establishing a range of estimated fair values of the underlying assets as of December 31, 2018. The Company's estimated fair value relating to its investment in DRV reflects the expected future cash distributions stemming from the value of the underlying assets at a point within that established range that management believes is most probable of realization, which, if liquidated, would result in an amount due to the Company based on the joint venture partners' respective waterfall distribution, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Downtown Railyard Venture, LLC, dated as of September 30, 2015. The Company selected the point within the range of estimated fair values established by the third-party independent appraisal that most appropriately reflects the underlying facts and circumstances of the investment, and as a result the Company recorded an other-than-temporary\nimpairment of $29,933 related to DRV on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDistribution rate\nOn March 2, 2018, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution paid in April 2018, from $0.0695 per share to $0.0716 per share, on an annualized basis.\nOn November 7, 2018, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution payable in April 2019, from $0.0716 per share to $0.0737, on an annualized basis.\nTender offer\nOn August 15, 2018, the Company announced and commenced a modified \"Dutch Auction\" tender offer (the \"2018 Offer\") to purchase for cash up to $75.0 million in value of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"Shares\"), subject to the Company's ability to increase the number of Shares accepted for payment in the 2018 Offer by up to 2% of the Company's outstanding Shares, without amending or extending the 2018 Offer in accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC. The Company exercised that option and increased the 2018 Offer by 10,706,774 shares, or $22.5 million, to avoid any proration for the stockholders tendering shares. The 2018 Offer expired on September 13, 2018.\nAs a result of the 2018 Offer, the Company accepted for purchase 46,559,289 shares of its common stock (which represented approximately 6.0% of the shares of common stock outstanding at the time) at a purchase price of $2.10 per share, for a cost of approximately $97.8 million, excluding fees and expenses as of December 31, 2018. Aggregate costs of $98.5 million were recorded as reductions to common stock and additional paid-in capital on the consolidated statement of equity for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent Activities\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated events and transactions occurring after December 31, 2018 through the date the financial statements were issued for recognition and disclosure purposes. On January 31, 2019, the Company acquired Commons at University Place, a 92,100 square foot neighborhood center located in the Raleigh-Cary, NC MSA, for a gross acquisition price of $23.3 million.\nCurrent Strategy and Outlook\nFor InvenTrust, the right properties include open-air grocery-anchored and certain necessity-based power centers, and the right markets mean those with above average growth in population, employment and wages. We believe these conditions create markets that are poised to experience increasing tenant demand for grocery-anchored and necessity-based retail centers, which will then position us to capitalize on potential future rent increases while enjoying sustained occupancy at our centers. Using these criteria, we have identified 10 to15 core markets within the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Denver, Houston, the greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas, suburban Washington, D.C., Miami, Orlando, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio and Tampa.\nWe have a coordinated program designed to increase rental income by maximizing re-development opportunities (which may have a mixed-use component) and identifying locations in our current multi-tenant retail platform where we can develop pad sites. We are continuing to work with our tenants to expand rentable square footage at select retail properties where demand warrants. In addition, due to our properties as both retail centers and community focal points, we are able to identify short-term and specialty leasing opportunities that generate revenue from areas of the properties which are typically vacant.\nOur grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers bring consumers to our well-located properties, while our larger-format necessity-based power center retailers continue to adapt their business models to embrace omni-channel retail and appeal to consumers' continuing focus on value. Our property management team is focused on enhancing the consumer shopping experience at our centers by maintaining strong tenant relationships, controlling expenses, and investing in sustainability programs at a number of our retail properties with initiatives such as LED lighting, trash recycling, water conservation and other programs to reduce energy consumption and expenses.\nIn addition, our leasing staff continues to focus on leasing space at our retail properties at favorable rental rates while establishing a more favorable tenant mix and identifying complementary uses to maximize tenant performance. We believe our strong locations have allowed and will continue to allow us to backfill the vacancies created by such tenants.\nWe believe that the continuing refinement of our multi-tenant retail platform will position us for future success and put us in a position to evaluate and ultimately execute on potential strategic transactions aimed at achieving liquidity for our stockholders\nin the long term. While we believe in our ability to execute on our plan, the speed of its completion is uncertain and may be shortened or extended by external and macroeconomic factors including, among others, interest rate movements, local, regional, national and global economic performance, competitive factors, the impact of e-commerce on the retail industry, future retailer store closings, retailer bankruptcies, and government policy changes.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following section describes and compares our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We generate substantially all of our net income from property operations. All dollar amounts shown in tables are stated in thousands unless otherwise noted.\nOperating Income and Expenses: ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and its financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nInvenTrust Properties Corp. is a premier retail REIT that owns, leases, redevelops, acquires and manages open-air centers in key growth markets with favorable demographics. We seek to continue to execute our strategy to enhance our multi-tenant retail platform by acquiring the right centers in the right markets, driven by focused and disciplined capital allocation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to execute on our strategy by opportunistically disposing of properties not located in our core markets or where we believe the properties' values have been maximized. Our strategy is to redeploy the proceeds from these sales with a disciplined approach into strategic retail properties in our target markets. However, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities. As a result of this competition, the purchase prices for attractive and suitable assets may be significantly elevated and may adversely impact our ability to redeploy the proceeds from property sales for reinvestment. In addition, our disposition activity could continue to cause us to experience dilution in financial operating performance during the period in which we dispose of properties.\nIn evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, management focuses on the following financial and non-financial indicators, discussed in further detail herein:\n \u2022 Property NOI, which excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, provision for asset impairment, interest and dividends from corporate investments, gains (losses) from sales of properties, gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, other income (expenses), interest expense, equity in earnings (losses) and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities, and realized and unrealized investment gains, net; \n \u2022 Modified NOI, which reflects property NOI exclusive of lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight-line rent and above/below market lease amortization); \n \u2022 FFO Applicable to Common Shares, a supplemental non-GAAP measure; \n \u2022 Cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP; \n \u2022 Economic and physical occupancy and rental rates; \n \u2022 Leasing activity and lease rollover; \n \u2022 Management of operating expenses; \n \u2022 Management of general and administrative expenses; \n \u2022 Debt maturities and leverage ratios; and \n \u2022 Liquidity levels. \nMulti-tenant retail platform\nOur wholly owned, consolidated, and managed retail properties include grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers and necessity-based power centers. As of December 31, 2018, we manage 71 retail properties, with a GLA of approximately 12.1 million square feet, which includes one retail property classified as a consolidated VIE, with a GLA of approximately 125,000 square feet, and 13 retail properties with a GLA of approximately 2.6 million square feet owned through the Company's ownership interest in IAGM.

Credit agreements\nUnsecured term loans\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated unsecured term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Term Loan Agreement\"). The Term Loan Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's prior term loan agreement in its entirety, provides for $400.0\nmillion in unsecured term loans. The Term Loan Agreement consists of two tranches of term loans: a $250.0 million 5-year tranche maturing on December 21, 2023 and a $150.0 million 5.5-year tranche maturing on June 21, 2024. Interest rates are based on the Company's total leverage ratio or, at the Company's one-time irrevocable option, upon the Company's achievement of an investment grade credit rating. Based upon the Company's total leverage ratio, as of December 31, 2018, all of the outstanding term loans bear interest at a rate of 1-Month LIBOR plus 1.20%. A fee is charged on the unused portion of the term loans at a rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.25% depending on the Company's total leverage ratio. Based on the Company's total leverage ratio as of December 31, 2018, the unused fee was 0.15%.\nAs of the closing date of the Term Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed $226.0 million under the 5-year tranche and $126.0 million under the 5.5-year tranche, of which $26.0 million from each tranche was used to pay off a $52.0 million outstanding unsecured revolving line of credit balance that was borrowed on July 12, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $24.0 million available for borrowing under the 5-year tranche and $24.0 million available for borrowing under the 5.5-year tranche.\nUnsecured revolving line of credit\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into a second amended and restated unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\"). The Revolving Credit Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's prior revolving credit agreement in its entirety, provides for a $350.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit. The Revolving Credit Agreement has a 4-year term maturing on December 21, 2022 with two six month extension options. Interest rates are based on the Company's total leverage ratio or, at the Company's one-time irrevocable option, upon achievement of an investment grade credit rating. Based upon the Company's total leverage ratio, as of December 31, 2018, outstanding revolving loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.05%. A facility fee accrues on the aggregate commitments at a rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.30% depending on the Company's total leverage ratio. Based on the Company's total leverage ratio as of December 31, 2018, the facility fee was 0.15%. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $350.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nJoint venture activity\nOn February 28, 2018, IAGM disposed of Bryant Square for a gross disposition price of $38.0 million and recognized a loss on the sale of this retail property of $3.9 million. On October 5, 2018, IAGM disposed of Victory Lakes Shopping Center for a gross disposition price of $53.0 million and recognized a loss on the sale of this retail property of $0.2 million. The Company's share of these aggregate losses was $2.3 million and is included in equity in (losses) earnings and (impairment), net, of unconsolidated entities on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, IAGM recorded an aggregate provision for asset impairment of $3.7 million on three retail properties based on purchase contracts.\nOn June 30, 2018, IAGM entered into an extension to June 30, 2019 on a non-recourse mortgage loan with a balance of $15.1 million related to one retail property.\nOn November 2, 2018, IAGM entered into a senior secured term loan facility of $152.0 million to refinance its mortgages payable maturing in 2018. The senior secured term loan facility matures in November 2023 and contains two twelve-month extension options that IAGM may exercise upon payment of an extension fee equal to 0.10% of the commitment amount on the first day of the extension term and subject to certain other conditions. The senior secured term loan facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR daily floating rate plus 1.55% and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants. As a result of this refinance, no IAGM mortgages payable are recourse to the Company.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company evaluated its investment in Downtown Railyard Venture, LLC (\"DRV\") for potential other-than-temporary impairment due to a reduction in expected holding period. The Company obtained a third party independent appraisal to assist in establishing a range of estimated fair values of the underlying assets as of December 31, 2018. The Company's estimated fair value relating to its investment in DRV reflects the expected future cash distributions stemming from the value of the underlying assets at a point within that established range that management believes is most probable of realization, which, if liquidated, would result in an amount due to the Company based on the joint venture partners' respective waterfall distribution, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Downtown Railyard Venture, LLC, dated as of September 30, 2015. The Company selected the point within the range of estimated fair values established by the third-party independent appraisal that most appropriately reflects the underlying facts and circumstances of the investment, and as a result the Company recorded an other-than-temporary\nimpairment of $29,933 related to DRV on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDistribution rate\nOn March 2, 2018, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution paid in April 2018, from $0.0695 per share to $0.0716 per share, on an annualized basis.\nOn November 7, 2018, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution payable in April 2019, from $0.0716 per share to $0.0737, on an annualized basis.\nTender offer\nOn August 15, 2018, the Company announced and commenced a modified \"Dutch Auction\" tender offer (the \"2018 Offer\") to purchase for cash up to $75.0 million in value of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"Shares\"), subject to the Company's ability to increase the number of Shares accepted for payment in the 2018 Offer by up to 2% of the Company's outstanding Shares, without amending or extending the 2018 Offer in accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC. The Company exercised that option and increased the 2018 Offer by 10,706,774 shares, or $22.5 million, to avoid any proration for the stockholders tendering shares. The 2018 Offer expired on September 13, 2018.\nAs a result of the 2018 Offer, the Company accepted for purchase 46,559,289 shares of its common stock (which represented approximately 6.0% of the shares of common stock outstanding at the time) at a purchase price of $2.10 per share, for a cost of approximately $97.8 million, excluding fees and expenses as of December 31, 2018. Aggregate costs of $98.5 million were recorded as reductions to common stock and additional paid-in capital on the consolidated statement of equity for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent Activities\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated events and transactions occurring after December 31, 2018 through the date the financial statements were issued for recognition and disclosure purposes. On January 31, 2019, the Company acquired Commons at University Place, a 92,100 square foot neighborhood center located in the Raleigh-Cary, NC MSA, for a gross acquisition price of $23.3 million.\nCurrent Strategy and Outlook\nFor InvenTrust, the right properties include open-air grocery-anchored and certain necessity-based power centers, and the right markets mean those with above average growth in population, employment and wages. We believe these conditions create markets that are poised to experience increasing tenant demand for grocery-anchored and necessity-based retail centers, which will then position us to capitalize on potential future rent increases while enjoying sustained occupancy at our centers. Using these criteria, we have identified 10 to15 core markets within the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Denver, Houston, the greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas, suburban Washington, D.C., Miami, Orlando, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio and Tampa.\nWe have a coordinated program designed to increase rental income by maximizing re-development opportunities (which may have a mixed-use component) and identifying locations in our current multi-tenant retail platform where we can develop pad sites. We are continuing to work with our tenants to expand rentable square footage at select retail properties where demand warrants. In addition, due to our properties as both retail centers and community focal points, we are able to identify short-term and specialty leasing opportunities that generate revenue from areas of the properties which are typically vacant.\nOur grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers bring consumers to our well-located properties, while our larger-format necessity-based power center retailers continue to adapt their business models to embrace omni-channel retail and appeal to consumers' continuing focus on value. Our property management team is focused on enhancing the consumer shopping experience at our centers by maintaining strong tenant relationships, controlling expenses, and investing in sustainability programs at a number of our retail properties with initiatives such as LED lighting, trash recycling, water conservation and other programs to reduce energy consumption and expenses.\nIn addition, our leasing staff continues to focus on leasing space at our retail properties at favorable rental rates while establishing a more favorable tenant mix and identifying complementary uses to maximize tenant performance. We believe our strong locations have allowed and will continue to allow us to backfill the vacancies created by such tenants.\nWe believe that the continuing refinement of our multi-tenant retail platform will position us for future success and put us in a position to evaluate and ultimately execute on potential strategic transactions aimed at achieving liquidity for our stockholders\nin the long term. While we believe in our ability to execute on our plan, the speed of its completion is uncertain and may be shortened or extended by external and macroeconomic factors including, among others, interest rate movements, local, regional, national and global economic performance, competitive factors, the impact of e-commerce on the retail industry, future retailer store closings, retailer bankruptcies, and government policy changes.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe following section describes and compares our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
