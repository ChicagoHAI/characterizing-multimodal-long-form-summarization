MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nHertz Global Holdings, Inc. is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is The Hertz Corporation. Hertz Global consolidates Hertz for financial statement purposes, and Hertz comprises approximately the entire balance of Hertz Global's assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. In addition, Hertz's operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of Hertz Global's revenues and operating expenses. As such, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") that follows herein is for Hertz and also applies to Hertz Global in all material respects, unless otherwise noted. Differences between the operations and results of Hertz and Hertz Global are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d and the Company\u201d in this MD&A for disclosures that relate to all of Hertz and Hertz Global.\nThe statements in this MD&A regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\u201d The following MD&A provides information that we believe to be relevant to an understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. You should read the following MD&A together with the sections entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIn this MD&A we refer to the following non-GAAP measure and key metrics:\n\u2022Adjusted Corporate EBITDA - important non-GAAP measure to management because it allows management to assess the operational performance of our business, exclusive of certain items, and allows management to assess the performance of the entire business on the same basis as the segment measure of profitability. Management believes that it is important to investors for the same reasons it is important to management and because it allows investors to assess our operational performance on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA, the segment measure of profitability and accordingly a GAAP measure, is calculated exclusive of certain items which are largely consistent with those used in the calculation of Adjusted Corporate EBITDA.\n\u2022Depreciation Per Unit Per Month - important key metric to management and investors as depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges is one of our largest expenses for the vehicle rental business and is driven by the number of vehicles, expected residual values at the expected time of disposal and expected hold period of the vehicles. Depreciation Per Unit Per Month is reflective of how we are managing the costs of our vehicles and facilitates a comparison with other participants in the vehicle rental industry.\n\u2022Total Revenue Per Transaction Day (\"Total RPD,\" also referred to as \"pricing\") - important key metric to management and investors as it represents a measurement of the changes in underlying pricing in the vehicle rental business and encompasses the elements in vehicle rental pricing that management has the ability to control.\n\u2022Total Revenue Per Unit Per Month (\"Total RPU\") - important key metric to management and investors as it provides a measure of revenue productivity relative to the total number of vehicles in our fleet whether owned or leased (\"Average Vehicles\" or \"fleet capacity\").\n\u2022Transaction Days - important key metric to management and investors as it represents the number of revenue generating days (\"volume\"). It is used as a component to measure Total RPD and Vehicle Utilization. Transaction Days represent the total number of 24-hour periods, with any partial period counted\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nas one Transaction Day, that vehicles were on rent (the period between when a rental contract is opened and closed) in a given period. Thus, it is possible for a vehicle to attain more than one Transaction Day in a 24-hour period.\n\u2022Vehicle Utilization - important key metric to management and investors because it is the measurement of the proportion of our vehicles that are being used to generate revenues relative to fleet capacity. Higher Vehicle Utilization means more vehicles are being utilized to generate revenues.\nOur non-GAAP measure and key metrics should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The above non-GAAP measure and key metrics are defined, and the non-GAAP measure is reconciled to its most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, in the \"Footnotes to the Results of Operations and Selected Operating Data by Segment Tables\" section of this MD&A.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, affecting multiple global regions. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses around the world. In an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19, many governments around the world placed significant restrictions on travel, individuals voluntarily reduced their air and other travel in attempts to avoid the outbreak and many businesses announced closures and imposed travel restrictions. There is continued uncertainty about the duration of the negative impact from COVID-19 and the length and scope of travel restrictions and business closures imposed by governments of impacted countries and voluntarily undertaken by private businesses.\nIn response to COVID-19, we began aggressively managing costs and (i) initiated a restructuring program affecting approximately 11,000 employees in our U.S. RAC segment and U.S. corporate operations; (ii) actively negotiated to abate or defer our airport rent and concession payments; (iii) substantially reduced capital expenditures; (iv) eliminated discretionary marketing spend; and (v) reduced our commitments to purchase vehicles by approximately $4.0 billion from original commitments in our U.S. RAC segment.\nAlthough we took aggressive action to eliminate costs, we faced significant ongoing monthly expenses, including monthly payments under our Operating Lease, pursuant to which Hertz leases vehicles which we use in our U.S. RAC rental car operations. On April 27, 2020, Hertz did not make certain payments in accordance with the Operating Lease, and as a result, an amortization event was in effect as of May 5, 2020 for all series of notes issued by HVF II and a liquidation event was in effect with respect to the Series 2013-A Notes issued by HVF II. Refer to Note 1, \"Background,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for additional information on the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver Agreements which expired on May 22, 2020.\nVoluntary Petitions for Bankruptcy\nIn connection with the expiration of the Forbearance Agreement and the Waiver Agreements described above and the continuing economic impact from COVID-19, on the Petition Date, the Debtors filed Petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered by the Bankruptcy Court under the caption In re The Hertz Corporation, et al., Case No. 20-11218 (MFW). Additional information about the Chapter 11 Cases, including access to documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court, is available online at https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/hertz, a website administered by Prime Clerk.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLiquidity Considerations Following the Chapter 11 Filing\nPer the terms of the Interim Lease Order entered on July 24, 2020, the Debtors were directed to, among other things, (i) make $650 million of base rent payments under the Operating Lease to the HVF trustee in the amount of six equal monthly payments of approximately $108 million commencing in July 2020 through December 2020; (ii) dispose of at least 182,521 lease vehicles between June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, inclusive, where the proceeds of the dispositions, subject to certain exclusions set forth in the Interim Lease Order, were to be used to make payments under the Operating Lease; (iii) fund interest payments on the Operating Lease from draws on certain existing letters of credit, which were reimbursable by the Debtors; and (iv) suspend litigation relating to the Operating Lease until January 15, 2021 with all parties reserving all rights with respect to future litigation claims. For the period June 1, 2020 through December 31,2020, we disposed of approximately 198,000 lease vehicles pursuant to or otherwise in satisfaction of our vehicle disposition obligations under the Interim Lease Order. Also, refer to the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section below.\nOn October 12, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing Hertz and Donlen to enter into certain agreements in connection with a new asset-based securitization facility with DFLF for the purposes of new interim fleet financing. On October 16, 2020, DFLF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $400 million pursuant to this new facility, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nOn October 29, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the Debtors to obtain certain debtor-in-possession financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on October 30, 2020, Hertz, as borrower, and Hertz Global and certain of its subsidiaries located in the U.S. and Canada, in each case that are debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases, as guarantors, entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. The DIP Credit Agreement provides for a superpriority secured debtor-in-possession credit facility comprised of the DIP Loans, of which (i) up to $1.0 billion can be used as equity for new interim fleet financing, giving the Debtors the ability to replenish their vehicle fleet in the future, and (ii) up to $800 million can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The DIP Loans are available in multiple draws of at least (i) $250 million each or (ii) the remaining available commitments if such commitments are less than $250 million. The DIP Loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 7.25% (subject to a 1.00% floor), which is reduced to LIBOR plus 6.75% upon a significant repayment of Pre-petition first lien debt. As of December 31, 2020, Hertz drew down $250 million from the DIP Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further details. On February 16, 2021, Hertz borrowed an additional $250 million as per the minimum draw requirement of the DIP Credit Agreement.\nOn November 24, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the formation of HVIF and for the Debtors to obtain interim fleet financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on November 25, 2020, HVIF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $4.0 billion, as further described in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nIn 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Lease Rejection Orders which were comprised of 359 off airport locations and 66 airport locations in our U.S. RAC segment, as further disclosed in Note 10, \"Leases,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further details. As a result of the Lease Rejection Orders, we have been consolidating our off airport rental locations and will continue to do so in 2021.\nOn January 20, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court authorized the Second Lease Order, which extended the forbearance period related to the Operating Lease to September 30, 2021, provided that the Debtors dispose of 121,510 lease vehicles, at least 113,381 of which will be non-program vehicles, and reach a minimum cumulative vehicle disposition proceeds of $2.0 billion by September 30, 2021. Additionally, the Second Lease Order directed the Debtors to (i) have no more than 157,262 lease vehicles by September 30, 2021 and (ii) make $756 million of base\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nrent payments under the Operating Lease to the HVF trustee in the amount of nine equal monthly payments of $84 million commencing in January 2021 through September 2021.\nOn January 28, 2021, Hertz subsidiary, TCL Funding Limited Partnership, entered into the Funding LP Series 2021-A Notes which provide for aggregate maximum borrowings of CAD$350 million on a revolving basis, subject to availability. The initial draw of CAD$120 million was used, in part, to pay the outstanding obligations under the Funding LP Series 2015-A Notes, including any unpaid default interest, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nAs a result of our actions to eliminate costs in 2020, we (i) negotiated rent concessions in the form of abatement and payment deferrals of fixed and variable rent payments for our airport and off airport locations in the amount of approximately $300 million which substantially represents amounts previously due in 2020; (ii) reduced our revenue earning vehicle expenditures by $8.2 billion, or 60%, in 2020 compared to 2019; (iii) reduced our non-vehicle capital asset expenditures by $126 million, or 56%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a reduction in information technology and finance transformation program costs; and (iv) sold approximately 308,000, or 6%, more vehicles in our U.S. RAC segment in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the Interim Lease Order. We continue to review our cost structure and fleet size to align with expected rental car volumes.\nNYSE Delisting\nAs a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, on October 29, 2020, the NYSE informed us that Hertz Global common stock was no longer suitable for listing on the NYSE and that the NYSE suspended trading of Hertz Global common stock (NYSE ticker symbol: HTZ) after the market close on October 29, 2020. Hertz Global common stock began trading exclusively on the over-the-counter market on October 30, 2020 under the symbol HTZGQ and was delisted from the NYSE on November 10, 2020 pursuant to Form 25. Upon deregistration of Hertz Global common stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, Hertz Global common stock remains registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.\nOur Business\nWe are engaged principally in the business of renting vehicles primarily through our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands. In addition to vehicle rental, we provide integrated vehicle leasing and fleet management solutions through our Donlen subsidiary, where in the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets as discussed below. Our profitability is primarily a function of the volume, mix and pricing of rental transactions and the utilization of vehicles, the related ownership cost of vehicles and other operating costs. Significant changes in the purchase price or residual values of vehicles or interest rates can have a significant effect on our profitability depending on our ability to adjust pricing for these changes. We continue to balance our mix of non-program and program vehicles based on market conditions, including residual values. Our business requires significant expenditures for vehicles, and as such, we require substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures. However, as a result of the Interim Lease Order, Hertz was directed to dispose of at least 182,521 lease vehicles between June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, where the proceeds from the dispositions were to be used to make payments under the Operating Lease. For the period from June 1, 2020 through December 31,2020, we disposed of approximately 198,000 lease vehicles pursuant to or otherwise in satisfaction of our vehicle disposition obligations under the Interim Lease Order. Additionally, under the Second Lease Order issued in January 2021, Hertz was directed to dispose of an additional 121,510 lease vehicles between January 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021, where the proceeds from the dispositions will be used to make payments under the Operating Lease. See the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section of this MD&A for further information.\nOur strategy includes optimization of our vehicle rental operations, disciplined performance management and evaluation of all locations and the pursuit of same-store sales growth.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nOur total revenues are primarily derived from rental and related charges and consist of:\n\u2022Worldwide vehicle rental revenues - revenues from all company-operated vehicle rental operations, including charges to customers for the reimbursement of costs incurred relating to airport concession fees and vehicle license fees, the fueling of vehicles and revenues associated with value-added services, including the sale of loss or collision damage waivers, theft protection, liability and personal accident/effects insurance coverage, premium emergency roadside service and other products and fees. Also included are ancillary revenues associated with retail vehicle sales and certain royalty fees from our franchisees (such fees are less than 2% of total revenues each period); and\n\u2022All other operations revenues - revenues from vehicle leasing and fleet management services by our Donlen business and other business activities, which in the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets as discussed below.\nOur expenses primarily consist of:\n\u2022Direct vehicle and operating expense (\"DOE\"), primarily wages and related benefits; commissions and concession fees paid to airport authorities, travel agents and others; facility, self-insurance and reservation costs; and other costs relating to the operation and rental of revenue earning vehicles, such as damage, maintenance and fuel costs;\n\u2022Depreciation expense and lease charges relating to revenue earning vehicles, including costs associated with the disposal of vehicles;\n\u2022Selling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\"), which includes costs for advertising costs and administrative personnel costs, along with information technology and finance transformation programs;\n\u2022Interest expense, net; and\n\u2022Reorganization items, net, which includes charges associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, primarily professional fees.\nOur Business Segments\nWe have identified three reportable segments, which are organized based on the products and services provided by our operating segments and the geographic areas in which our operating segments conduct business, as follows:\n\u2022U.S. RAC - Rental of vehicles, as well as sales of value-added services, in the U.S.;\n\u2022International RAC - Rental and leasing of vehicles, as well as sales of value-added services, internationally; and\n\u2022All Other Operations - Comprised primarily of our Donlen business, which provides vehicle leasing and fleet management services, and other business activities. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets. Accordingly, the Donlen Assets have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. See Note 3, \"Divestitures,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further information.\nIn addition to the above reportable segments, we have Corporate operations. We assess performance and allocate resources based upon the financial information for our operating segments.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRevenue Earning Vehicles\nRevenue earning vehicles used in our rental and leasing operations are recorded at cost, net of related discounts and incentives from manufacturers. Holding periods typically range from six to thirty-six months. Also included in revenue earning vehicles are vehicles placed on our retail lots for sale or actively in the process of being sold through other disposition channels.\nProgram vehicles are purchased under repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs with vehicle manufacturers wherein the manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during established repurchase periods, subject to, among other things, certain vehicle condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Guaranteed depreciation programs guarantee the residual value of the program vehicle upon sale, subject to, among other things, certain vehicle condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Program vehicles generally provide us with flexibility to increase or reduce the size of our fleet based on market demand. When we increase the percentage of program vehicles, the average age of our fleet decreases since the average holding period for program vehicles is shorter than that for non-program vehicles.\nWhen a revenue earning vehicle is acquired outside of a vehicle repurchase program, we estimate the period that we will hold the asset, primarily based on historical measures of the amount of rental activity (e.g., automobile mileage). We also estimate the residual value of the applicable revenue earning vehicles at the expected time of disposal, considering factors such as make, model and options, age, physical condition, mileage, sale location, time of the year and channel of disposition (e.g., auction, retail, dealer direct) and market conditions. The vehicle is depreciated using a rate based on these estimates. Depreciation rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis based on management's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions, their effect on residual values at the expected time of disposal and the estimated holding period of the vehicle. Differences between actual residual values and those estimated result in an adjustment to depreciation upon disposition of the vehicle. Our depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges also includes costs associated with the disposal of vehicles and rents paid for vehicles leased.\nWe dispose of our non-program vehicles via auction, dealer-direct and our retail locations. Non-program vehicles disposed of through our retail locations allow us the opportunity for value-added revenue, such as warranty, financing and title fees. We periodically review and adjust the mix between program and non-program vehicles in our fleet based on contract negotiations and the economic environment pertaining to our industry in an effort to optimize the mix of vehicles. Additionally, the use of program vehicles reduces the volatility associated with residual value estimation.\n2020 Operating Overview\nCOVID-19 has caused a substantial reduction to airline travel during 2020. As a large portion of our business is generated at airport locations, these disruptions have had, and we expect it to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our results of operations until such travel returns to historic levels.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

The decrease in our U.S. RAC segment is due primarily to lower volume driven by the impact from COVID-19 on total revenues described above, lower personnel costs and other cost elimination initiatives. Excluding the $3 million impact of fx, DOE for International RAC decreased $573 million due primarily to lower volume driven by the impact from COVID-19 on total revenues described above and lower personnel costs due to employee furloughs and associated government support across Europe related to COVID-19.\nDepreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges decreased $533 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to decreases of $333 million and $165 million in our U.S. RAC and International RAC segments, respectively. The decreases in our U.S. RAC and International RAC segments are due primarily to a reduction in fleet size in response to pandemic-related declines in consumer demand.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nSG&A decreased $305 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to lower marketing costs in our U.S. and International RAC segments, lower personnel costs in our U.S. RAC segment and lower information technology and finance transformation costs in our corporate operations.\nVehicle interest expense, net decreased $38 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to lower vehicle debt levels primarily in our U.S. RAC segment.\nNon-vehicle interest expense, net decreased $154 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to lower debt levels, lower market interest rates and the suspension of interest on certain non-vehicle debt as a result of filing the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe incurred charges of $213 million for impairment of intangible and other assets in 2020 due primarily to $124 million impairment of technology-related intangible assets and $69 million impairment of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs in our corporate operations due to uncertainty surrounding our financial ability to complete certain information technology projects as a result of COVID-19 and the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. Additionally, we incurred a charge of $20 million for impairment of the Hertz tradename in our International RAC segment as a result of our annual testing of the recoverability of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nWe incurred a charge of $133 million in 2020 in our corporate operations resulting from the full write-off of the 2019 Master Loan with Hertz Holdings due to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOther income of $9 million in 2020 was primarily comprised of a $20 million gain due to additional cash received from the sale of non-vehicle capital assets, primarily offset by $11 million in pension-related settlement charges. Other income of $59 million in 2019 was primarily comprised of a $30 million gain on marketable securities and a $39 million gain on non-vehicle capital assets.\nWe incurred $175 million of net reorganization charges in 2020 in our corporate operations for professional fees and other costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe effective tax rate in 2020 was 15% compared to 326% in 2019. We recorded a tax benefit of $328 million in 2020 compared to a tax provision of $65 million in 2019. The effective income tax rate and related tax benefit in 2020 compared to 2019 were driven by increased losses on our operations due to the effects of COVID-19, primarily offset by the impact of valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets for certain foreign and domestic jurisdictions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nTotal revenues increased $276 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase of $459 million in our U.S. RAC segment, partially offset by a decrease of $107 million and $76 million in our International RAC and our All Other Operations segments, respectively. U.S. RAC revenues increased due to a 4% increase in volume and a 2% increase in Total RPD. Excluding the impact of fx, revenues for our International RAC segment were flat. The decrease in All Other Operations was due to the impact of a change in presentation for certain leased vehicles beginning in the first quarter of 2019.\nDOE increased $131 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase of $132 million and $7 million in our U.S. RAC and International RAC segments, respectively, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in our All Other Operations segment. The increase in U.S. RAC DOE was driven by increased volume. Excluding the $69 million impact of fx, DOE for International RAC increased $76 million driven primarily by an increase in vehicle-related expenses.\nDepreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges decreased $125 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease of $95 million and $22 million in our All Other Operations and U.S. RAC segments, respectively.

The decrease in our U.S. RAC segment was primarily due to our vehicle acquisition strategy and continued strength in residual values.\nSG&A decreased $47 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses in our Corporate operations and International RAC segment and the impact from fx in our International RAC segment, partially offset by increased marketing charges in our U.S. RAC segment and increased information technology and finance transformation charges in our Corporate operations.\nVehicle interest expense, net increased $45 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in debt levels resulting from higher average fleet primarily in our U.S. RAC segment and higher market interest rates. Additionally, there was a $20 million loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in our International RAC segment in 2018 with no comparable charge in 2019.\nNon-vehicle interest expense, net increased $20 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a $43 million loss on extinguishment of debt primarily associated with the partial redemption of the Senior Second Priority Secured Notes in 2019 with no comparable charges in 2018, partially offset by lower levels of non-vehicle debt in 2019 due to net proceeds from the Rights Offering which were used to redeem the 2020 and 2021 Notes.\nOther income of $59 million in 2019 was primarily comprised of a $30 million gain on marketable securities and a $39 million gain on non-vehicle capital assets. Other income of $40 million in 2018 was primarily comprised of a $20 million gain on marketable securities, $10 million of net pension benefit income and a $6 million legal settlement related to an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\nThe effective tax rate in 2019 was 326% compared to 11% in 2018. We recorded a tax provision of $65 million in 2019 compared to a tax benefit of $28 million in 2018. The effective income tax rate and related tax provision in 2019 are greater than 2018 due to an increase in the valuation allowance relating to losses in certain U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions and an increase in pretax operating results.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - HERTZ GLOBAL\nThe above discussion for Hertz also applies to Hertz Global.\nHertz Global had $2 million, $7 million and $7 million of interest expense, net, during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that was incremental to the amounts shown for Hertz. These amounts represent interest associated with amounts outstanding under a master loan agreement between the companies. Hertz includes this amount as interest income in its statements of operations, but this amount is eliminated in consolidation for purposes of Hertz Global. In 2020, Hertz Global had $1 million of income tax benefit that was incremental to the amounts shown for Hertz due primarily to the $133 million master loan write-off included in Hertz's consolidated statements of operations. In 2019, Hertz had $2 million of tax provision that was incremental to the amounts shown for Hertz Global. In 2018, Hertz Global had $2 million of income tax benefit that was incremental to the amounts shown for Hertz.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SELECTED OPERATING DATA BY SEGMENT\nU.S. Rental Car\nAs of December 31, 2020, our U.S. Rental Car operations had a total of approximately 3,900 corporate and franchisee locations, comprised of 1,500 airport and 2,400 off airport locations. The approximate 7% decrease in total locations from 2019 is primarily the product of a location rationalization effort in the Chapter 11 Cases as reflected in the Lease Rejection Orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court.

Lower year-over-year revenue and depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges were driven by the impact of a change in presentation for certain leased vehicles in 2019 versus 2018. Excluding the $79 million reduction in revenues from the change in presentation in 2019 and the $53 million benefit in 2018 of vehicles leased under sales-type leases, revenue grew 8%.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur U.S. and international operations are funded by cash provided by operating activities and by extensive financing arrangements maintained by us in the U.S. and internationally.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 billion of unrestricted cash and unrestricted cash equivalents and $383 million of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, $479 million of unrestricted cash and unrestricted cash equivalents and $60 million of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents were held by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. As a result of the impact of COVID-19 discussed above, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to our non-U.S. earnings, and if not in the form of loan repayments or subject to favorable tax treaties, repatriation of some of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations could expose us to additional cash taxes.\nLiquidity Considerations Related to COVID-19\nAs discussed above, the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread across the globe, resulting in a global economic slowdown and disruptions of travel and other industries, all of which are continuing to negatively impact our business and industry. In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners being prevented from conducting normal business activities temporarily or for an indefinite period of time. This was largely caused by shutdowns that were initially requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Additionally, individuals voluntarily reduced travel in attempts to avoid the outbreak.\nAlthough we took aggressive action to eliminate costs, we faced significant ongoing monthly expenses, including monthly payments under our Operating Lease, pursuant to which Hertz leases vehicles which we use in our U.S. rental car operations. On April 27, 2020, Hertz did not make certain payments in accordance with the Operating Lease, and as a result, an amortization event was in effect as of May 5, 2020 for all series of notes issued by HVF II and a liquidation event was in effect with respect to the Series 2013-A Notes issued by HVF II. Refer to Note 1, \"Background,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for additional information on the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver Agreements which expired on May 22, 2020.\nVoluntary Petitions for Bankruptcy\nIn connection with the expiration of the Forbearance Agreement and the Waiver Agreements described above and the continuing economic impact from COVID-19, on May 22, 2020, the Debtors filed Petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered by the Bankruptcy Court under the caption In re The Hertz Corporation, et al., Case No. 20-11218 (MFW). Additional information about the Chapter 11 Cases, including access to documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court, is available online at https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/hertz, a website administered by Prime Clerk. The information on this website is not incorporated by reference and does not constitute part of this 2020 Annual Report.\nIn May 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved motions filed by the Debtors that were designed primarily to mitigate the impact of the Chapter 11 Cases on our operations, customers and employees. The Debtors are authorized to conduct business activities in the ordinary course, and pursuant to orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors are authorized to, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of such orders (i) pay employees' wages and related obligations; (ii) pay certain taxes; (iii) pay critical vendors and certain fees to airport authorities and provide adequate protection; (iv) continue to maintain certain customer programs; (v) maintain insurance programs; (vi) use certain cash collateral on an interim basis; (vii) honor certain obligations to franchisees; and (viii) maintain existing cash management systems.\nBorrowing Capacity and Availability\nThe filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted defaults, termination events and/or amortization events with respect to certain of our existing debt obligations. As a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the remaining capacity\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nunder almost all of our revolving credit facilities was terminated, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report. Consequently, the sales proceeds from vehicles which serve as collateral for such vehicle finance facilities must be applied to the payment of the related indebtedness of the Non-Debtor Financing Subsidiaries and are not otherwise available to fund our operations. Additionally, we are precluded from accessing any of our subordinated investment in the vehicle collateral until the related defaults are waived or the third party funding under those facilities has been retired, either through the monetization of the underlying collateral or the refinancing of the related indebtedness. Proceeds from vehicle receivables, excluding manufacturer rebates, as of December 31, 2020 and ongoing vehicle sales must be applied to vehicle debt in amortization.\nPer the terms of the Interim Lease Order entered on July 24, 2020, the Debtors were directed to, among other things, (i) make $650 million of base rent payments under the Operating Lease to the HVF trustee in the amount of six equal monthly payments of approximately $108 million commencing in July 2020 through December 2020; (ii) dispose of at least 182,521 lease vehicles between June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, inclusive, where the proceeds of the dispositions, subject to certain exclusions set forth in the Interim Lease Order, were to be used to make payments under the Operating Lease; (iii) fund interest payments on the Operating Lease from draws on certain existing letters of credit, which were reimbursable by the Debtors; and (iv) suspend litigation relating to the Operating Lease until January 15, 2021 with all parties reserving all rights with respect to future litigation claims. For the period from June 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, we disposed of approximately 198,000 lease vehicles pursuant to or otherwise in satisfaction of our vehicle disposition obligations under the Interim Lease Order.\nOn October 12, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing Hertz and Donlen to enter into certain agreements in connection with DFLF. On October 16, 2020, DFLF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes to offset funding needs created by the amortization of the HFLF Variable Funding Notes, where DFLF will fund lease originations going forward. As of December 31, 2020, DFLF has access to up to $400 million of available funding, subject to certain conditions, and $250 million of committed funding available which increases by a minimum of $50 million per month, subject to the payment of incremental up-front fees, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nOn October 29, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the Debtors to obtain certain debtor-in-possession financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on October 30, 2020, Hertz, as borrower, and Hertz Global and certain of its subsidiaries located in the U.S. and Canada, in each case that are debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases, as guarantors, entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. The DIP Credit Agreement provides for DIP Loans in an aggregate amount of up to $1.65 billion, of which (i) up to $1.0 billion can be used as equity for new interim fleet financing, giving the Debtors the ability to replenish their vehicle fleet in the future, and (ii) up to $800 million can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The DIP Loans are available in multiple draws of at least (i) $250 million each or (ii) the remaining available commitments if such commitments are less than $250 million. The DIP Loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 7.25% (subject to a 1.00% floor), which is reduced to LIBOR plus 6.75% upon a significant repayment of Pre-petition first lien debt. As of December 31, 2020, we drew $250 million from the DIP Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further details. On February 16, 2021, Hertz borrowed an additional $250 million as per the minimum draw requirement of the DIP Credit Agreement.\nOn November 24, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the formation of HVIF and for the Debtors to obtain interim fleet financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on November 25, 2020, HVIF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $4.0 billion, as further described in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nIn 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Lease Rejection Orders which applied, in the aggregate, to 359 off airport and 66 airport locations in our U.S. RAC segment, as further disclosed in Note 10, \"Leases,\" to the Notes to\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nour consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nOn January 20, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court authorized the Second Lease Order, which extended the forbearance period related to the Operating Lease to September 30, 2021, provided that the Debtors dispose of 121,510 lease vehicles, at least 113,381 of which will be non-program vehicles, and reach a minimum cumulative vehicle disposition proceeds of $2.0 billion by September 30, 2021. Additionally, the Second Lease Order directed the Debtors to (i) have no more than 157,262 lease vehicles by September 30, 2021 and (ii) make $756 million of base rent payments under the Operating Lease to the HVF trustee in the amount of nine equal monthly payments of $84 million commencing in January 2021 through September 2021.\nOn January 28, 2021, Hertz subsidiary, TCL Funding Limited Partnership, entered into the Funding LP Series 2021-A Notes which provide for aggregate maximum borrowings of CAD$350 million on a revolving basis, subject to availability. The initial draw of CAD$120 million was used, in part, to pay the outstanding obligations under the Funding LP Series 2015-A Notes, including any unpaid default interest, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nOur inability to retain any proceeds from the sale of vehicles under our U.S. ABS programs means that our sources of liquidity are primarily our unrestricted cash and unrestricted cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from our operations and availability under our DIP Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 billion of unrestricted cash and unrestricted cash equivalents and approximately $1.1 billion of availability under the DIP Credit Agreement, net of the $275 million minimum liquidity requirement, for a total liquidity of $2.2 billion which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operations through approximately December 31, 2021, assuming we do not experience any unforeseen liquidity needs before then, which could result in the utilization of the liquidity in advance of December 31, 2021.\nWe currently have waivers related to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases under our European ABS and U.K. Fleet Financing facility that are currently set to expire on March 5, 2021, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nAs a result of our actions to eliminate costs in 2020, we (i) negotiated rent concessions in the form of abatement and payment deferrals of fixed and variable rent payments for our airport and off airport locations in the amount of approximately $300 million which substantially represents amounts previously due in 2020; (ii) reduced our revenue earning vehicle expenditures by $8.2 billion, or 60%, in 2020 compared to 2019; (iii) reduced our non-vehicle capital asset expenditures by $126 million, or 56%, in 2020 compared to 2019; and (iv) sold 308,000, or 6%, more vehicles in our U.S. RAC segment in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the Interim Lease Order. We continue to review our cost structure and fleet size to align with expected rental car volumes.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

However, Hertz disposed of approximately 198,000 lease vehicles between June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, pursuant to or otherwise in satisfaction of our vehicle disposition obligations under the Interim Lease Order, where the proceeds from the dispositions were used to make payments under the Operating Lease. There was a $9.0 billion decrease in the use of cash for investing activities year over year. Cash outflows for revenue earning vehicles decreased $8.2 billion as we reduced our commitments to purchase vehicles, primarily in our U.S. RAC segment, due to the impact from COVID-19 and a $612 million increase of cash proceeds from disposals of revenue earning vehicles as we accelerated the disposition of vehicles due to the Interim Lease Order.\nNet financing cash outflows were $5.4 billion in 2020 compared to cash inflows of $1.5 billion in 2019 primarily due to a $8.5 billion reduction in vehicle debt borrowings as we reduced our commitments to purchase vehicles, partially offset by a $1.7 billion reduction in non-vehicle repayments, net of new borrowings, primarily resulting from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared with year ended December 31, 2018\nIn 2019, cash flows from operating activities, adjusted for non-cash, non-operating items and the net impact from operating leases, decreased by $111 million year over year due to a decrease in accrued liabilities for operational expenses, partially offset by an increase in cash primarily due to the timing of value added tax receivables in our International RAC segment.\nOur primary investing activities relate to the acquisition and disposal of revenue earning vehicles. There was a $228 million increase in the use of cash for investing activities year over year. Net cash outflows for revenue earning vehicles increased $187 million primarily due to a higher volume of vehicles acquired, net of disposals in our International RAC segment. Additionally, there was a $71 million increase in net cash outflows for the purchase of non-vehicle capital assets primarily in our corporate operations for our information technology and finance transformation programs.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nNet financing cash inflows were $1.5 billion in 2019 compared to $1.6 billion in 2018 driven by a reduction in net vehicle debt borrowings. Net proceeds from the Rights Offering in 2019 were used to redeem non-vehicle debt resulting in a $702 million increase in net non-vehicle debt repayments.\nCash Flows - Hertz Global\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Hertz Global had unrestricted cash and unrestricted cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and $865 million, respectively, and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $411 million and $495 million, respectively.

Cash paid for interest during 2020 was $109 million for interest on non-vehicle debt and $335 million for interest on vehicle debt. Cash paid for interest during 2019 was $272 million for interest on non-vehicle debt and $431 million for interest on vehicle debt. The $163 million reduction in non-vehicle debt interest is primarily due to suspending interest payments on certain debt due to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur corporate liquidity, which excludes unused commitments under our vehicle debt, was as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>As of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>865 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Availability under the Senior RCF </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>526 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate liquidity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nSignificant financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 for our non-vehicle and vehicle debt, including the issuance of equity, were as follows:\nATM Program\nIn June 2020, subsequent to approval from the Bankruptcy Court and pursuant to a prospectus supplement to the Registration Statement, Hertz Global entered into an open market sale agreement under which it may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million. Prior to its suspension on June 15, 2020 and ultimate termination on June 18, 2020, Hertz Global issued 13,912,368 shares under the ATM Program for net proceeds of approximately $28 million, which is included in non-vehicle restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nNon-vehicle Debt\nOn October 29, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the Debtors to obtain certain debtor-in-possession financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on October 30, 2020, Hertz, as borrower, and Hertz Global and certain of its subsidiaries located in the U.S. and Canada, in each case that are debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases, as guarantors, entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. The DIP Credit Agreement provides for a superpriority secured debtor-in-possession credit facility comprised of delayed-draw term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $1.65 billion, of which (i) up to $1.0 billion can be used as equity for new interim fleet financing, giving the Debtors the ability to replenish their vehicle fleet in the future, and (ii) up to $800 million can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The DIP Loans are available in multiple draws of at least (i) $250 million each or (ii) the remaining available commitments if such commitments are less than $250 million. The DIP Loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 7.25% (subject to a 1.00% floor), which is reduced to LIBOR plus 6.75% upon a significant repayment of Pre-petition first lien debt.\nIn November 2020, Hertz drew $250 million from the DIP Credit Agreement and utilized $50 million to make a capital contribution to HVIF in order to pay fees associated with the issuance of the HVIF Series 2020-1 Notes, as defined below.\nLetters of Credit\nIn January 2020, under the terms of the Alternative Letter of Credit Facility, Hertz increased the commitments thereunder by $100 million, such that after giving effect to such increase, there are $200 million of standby letters of credit issued under the facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $17 million and $114 million of the issued letters of credit have been drawn upon under the Senior RCF and Alternative Letter of Credit Facility, respectively, to fund interest payments due under the HVF II Notes. The draws remain unreimbursed and, as a result, are accruing interest at the non-default rate, except as otherwise set forth in orders from the Bankruptcy Court.\nVehicle Debt\nWe organize our discussion of significant vehicle debt financing facilities below by reportable segment.\nU.S. RAC\n\u2022The aggregate principal amount of medium term notes outstanding decreased from $6.6 billion to $2.7 billion as a result of an amortization event in effect as of May 5, 2020 for all series of notes issued by HVF II in which proceeds from the sales of vehicles that collateralize the notes issued by HVF II must be primarily\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\napplied to the payment of principal and are allocated on what approximates a pro rata basis to the reduction of principal on the basis of seniority by class;\n\u2022The aggregate principal amount of variable term notes outstanding decreased from $2.6 billion to $1.9 billion as a result of an amortization event in effect for all series of notes issued by HVF II as described in the preceding paragraph;\n\u2022There is no remaining capacity under the various U.S. RAC revolving vehicle debt financing facilities as unused commitments were terminated as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases; and\n\u2022On November 24, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the formation of HVIF and for the Debtors to obtain interim fleet financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on November 25, 2020, HVIF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $4.0 billion.\nAll Other Operations - Donlen\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. See Note 3, \"Divestitures,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further information. Additionally,\n\u2022The aggregate principal amount of HFLF medium term notes outstanding decreased from $1.4 billion to $734 million as a result of an amortization event where proceeds from lease payments and from the sales of vehicles that collateralize the notes issued by HFLF must be applied to the reduction of principal and payment of interest on the notes while the amortization events continue; and\n\u2022On October 12, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing Hertz and Donlen to enter into certain agreements in connection with DFLF. On October 16, 2020, DFLF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $400 million pursuant to this new facility.\nSubstantially all of our revenue earning vehicles and certain related assets are owned by special purpose entities or are encumbered in favor of our lenders under our various credit facilities, other secured financings and asset-backed securities programs. None of the value of such assets (including the assets owned by Hertz Vehicle Financing II LP, HVF II GP Corp., Hertz Vehicle Financing LLC, Rental Car Finance LLC, HFLF and various international subsidiaries that facilitate our international securitizations) will be available to satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors unless the secured creditors are paid in full. For a discussion of additional risks associated with COVID-19, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this 2020 Annual Report.\nApproximately $1.0 billion of non-vehicle debt, of which $760 million is included in liabilities subject to compromise in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, and $1.7 billion of vehicle debt will mature during the twelve months following the issuance of this 2020 Annual Report, which does not reflect any potential changes to the Company's debt that may result from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nCovenants\nPrior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, Hertz's consolidated first lien net leverage ratio (the \"Leverage Ratio\"), as defined in the credit agreements governing the Senior RCF, the Letter of Credit Facility and the Alternative Letter of Credit Facility, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter may not exceed a ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. As a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, we are currently in default under our Senior RCF, the Letter of Credit Facility and the Alternative Letter of Credit Facility, and we are in breach of the Leverage Ratio.\nAs defined in the DIP Credit Agreement, a liquidity maintenance test is required as of each month end period. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the liquidity maintenance test.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nSummarized Financial Information - Hertz\nThe following tables present the summarized financial information as combined for The Hertz Corporation, (\"Parent\u201d), and the Parent's subsidiaries that guarantee the Senior Notes issued by the Parent (\"Guarantor Subsidiaries\"). The Guarantor Subsidiaries are 100% owned by the Parent and all guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. Additionally, substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are pledged under the Senior Facilities and Senior Second Priority Secured Notes and the value of such assets will not be available to satisfy the claims of the unsecured creditors of Hertz until the claims of secured creditors are paid in full.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we early adopted Rule 13-01 of the SEC's Regulation S-X that simplifies the existing disclosure requirements for the Guarantor Subsidiaries and allows for the simplified disclosure to be included within Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" In lieu of providing separate unaudited financial statements for the Guarantor Subsidiaries, Hertz has included the accompanying summarized financial information based on Rule 13-01 of the SEC's Regulation S-X. Management of Hertz does not believe that separate financial statements of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are material to Hertz's investors; therefore, separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the Guarantor Subsidiaries are not presented.\nSummarized financial information for the Guarantor Subsidiaries is as follows:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due from affiliates </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,562 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets </td> <td>67,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,964 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due to affiliates(1)\n</td> <td>54,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities </td> <td>63,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,982 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Due to affiliates of $53.5 billion is classified as liabilities subject to compromise as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries(1)\n</td> <td>(3,308) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>(1,846) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Hertz </td> <td>(1,846) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes $2.7 billion of intercompany vehicle lease charges from non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nVehicle Financing Risks\nOur program vehicles are subject to repurchase by vehicle manufacturers under contractual repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs. Under these programs, vehicle manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during a specified time period, typically subject to certain vehicle condition and mileage requirements. We use values derived from this specified price or guaranteed depreciation rate to calculate financing capacity under certain asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements.\nIn the event of a bankruptcy of a vehicle manufacturer, our liquidity could be impacted by several factors including reductions in fleet residual values and the risk that we would be unable to collect outstanding receivables due to us from such bankrupt manufacturer. In addition, the program vehicles manufactured by any such company would\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nneed to be removed from our financing facilities or re-designated as non-program vehicles, which would require us to furnish additional credit enhancement associated with these program vehicles.\nWe rely significantly on asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements to purchase vehicles for our U.S. and international vehicle rental fleet. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements available to us are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy, which include our ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval, our ability to comply with and operate under the requirements and constraints of the Bankruptcy Code and, in the event of such financings, our ability to comply with the terms of such financings. There continues to be uncertainty regarding the potential impact of various SEC rules and regulations governing asset-backed securities and additional requirements contained in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (including risk retention requirements) and the Basel III regulatory capital rules, a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk. While we will continue to monitor these developments and their impact on our ABS program, such rules and regulations may impact our ability and/or desire to engage in asset-backed financings in the future. For further information concerning our asset-backed financing programs and our indebtedness, see Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" For a discussion of the risks associated with our reliance on asset-backed and asset-based financing and the significant amount of indebtedness, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this 2020 Annual Report.\nCapital Expenditures\nRevenue Earning Vehicles Expenditures and Disposals\nThe table below sets forth our revenue earning vehicles expenditures and related disposal proceeds for the annual periods shown:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash inflow (cash outflow) </td> <td>Revenue Earning Vehicles </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>Capital\nExpenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>Disposal\nProceeds </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Capital Proceeds (Expenditures) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,542) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,556 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 </td> <td>(13,714) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,228) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 </td> <td>(12,493) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,041) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below sets forth expenditures for revenue earning vehicles, net of proceeds from disposal, by segment:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash inflow (cash outflow) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Rental Car </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,013) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,992) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(226) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Rental Car </td> <td>1,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(528) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(422) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(298) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other Operations </td> <td>(276) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(687) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(627) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,228) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,041) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(208) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(187) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared with year ended December 31, 2019\nIn 2020, net expenditures on revenue earning vehicles decreased by $8.8 billion, primarily in our U.S. RAC segment, as we reduced our commitments to purchase vehicles due to the impact from COVID-19, partially offset by an increase of cash proceeds from disposals of revenue earning vehicles as we accelerated the disposition of vehicles due to the Interim Lease Order.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

Credit agreements governing Hertz's Senior Facilities, Letter of Credit Facility, Alternative Letter of Credit Facility and DIP Credit Agreement restrict Hertz's ability to make dividends and certain payments, including payments to Hertz Holdings for share repurchases.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

These indemnification obligations might include claims relating to the following: environmental matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; customer, supplier and other commercial contractual relationships and financial matters. Performance under these indemnification obligations would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third-party claim. We regularly evaluate the\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nprobability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnification obligations and have accrued for expected losses that are probable and estimable. The types of indemnification obligations for which payments are possible include the following:\nCertain former Stockholders; Directors\nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our executive officers. Hertz entered into customary indemnification agreements with Hertz Holdings pursuant to which Hertz Holdings and Hertz will indemnify those entities and certain of our former stockholders and their affiliates and their respective affiliates, directors, officers, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives and controlling persons, against certain liabilities arising out of performance of a consulting agreement with Hertz Holdings and each of such entities and certain other claims and liabilities, including liabilities arising out of financing arrangements or securities offerings. We do not believe that these indemnifications are reasonably likely to have a material impact on us.\nEnvironmental\nWe have indemnified various parties for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage, recycling or disposal sites in many states and, in some instances, for natural resource damages. The amount of any such expenses or related natural resource damages for which we may be held responsible could be substantial. The probable expenses that we expect to incur for such matters have been accrued, and those expenses are reflected in our consolidated financial statements within accrued liabilities. Amounts accrued represent the estimated cost to study potential environmental issues at sites deemed to require investigation or clean-up activities, and the estimated cost to implement remediation actions, including on-going maintenance, as required. Initial cost estimates are based on historical experience at similar sites and are refined over time on the basis of in-depth studies of the sites. For many sites, the remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible cannot be reasonably estimated because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site, the materials there, the involvement of other potentially responsible parties, the application of laws and other standards or regulations, site conditions, and the nature and scope of investigations, studies, and remediation to be undertaken (including the technologies to be required and the extent, duration, and success of remediation).\nEMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nPension\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans worldwide. Pension obligations give rise to expenses that are dependent on assumptions discussed in Note 8, \"Employee Retirement Benefits,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" As a result of filing the Chapter 11 Cases, participants of the Supplemental Plans are no longer entitled to benefit payments and are considered general creditors, as further disclosed in Note 8, \"Employee Retirement Benefits,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" As such, we classified $24 million of our U.S. pension benefit obligation as liabilities subject to compromise in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nOur 2020 worldwide net periodic pension expense included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $8 million, which is comparable to 2019.\nThe funded status (i.e., the dollar amount by which the projected benefit obligations exceeded the market value of pension plan assets) of the Hertz Retirement Plan, as defined in Note 8, \"Employee Retirement Benefits,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" in which most domestic employees participate, improved in December 31, 2020 compared with December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower actuarial losses. We did not contribute to the Hertz Retirement Plan during 2020, and we do not anticipate contributing to the Hertz Retirement\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nPlan during 2021. For the international plans, we anticipate contributing $3 million during 2021. The level of 2021 and future contributions will vary, and is dependent on a number of factors including investment returns, interest rate fluctuations, plan demographics, funding regulations and the results of the final actuarial valuation.\nWe participate in several \"multiemployer\" pension plans. Amounts accrued for benefit payments under our multiemployer pension plans of $2 million have been classified as liabilities subject to compromise in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, payable in installments over a minimum of twenty years, which would be reflected as a liability on a discounted basis on our consolidated balance sheet. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. Our multiemployer plans could have significant underfunded liabilities. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a discussion of the risks associated with our pension plans, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\u201d in this 2020 Annual Report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nThe following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application, and therefore, represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. For additional discussion of our critical accounting policies, as well as our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nRevenue Earning Vehicles\nOur principal assets are revenue earning vehicles, which represented approximately 36% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020. Revenue earning vehicles consists of vehicles utilized in our vehicle rental operations and our Donlen business. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 29% of the vehicles purchased for our combined U.S. and International vehicle rental fleets were vehicles purchased under repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs with vehicle manufacturers, or program vehicles.\nUnder our vehicle repurchase programs, the manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during established repurchase periods, subject to, among other things, certain vehicle condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Guaranteed depreciation programs guarantee on an aggregate basis the residual value of the vehicles covered by the programs upon sale according to certain parameters which include the holding period, mileage and condition of the vehicles. We record a provision for excess mileage and vehicle condition, as necessary, during the holding period. These repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs limit our residual risk with respect to vehicles purchased under the programs and allow us to reduce the variability of depreciation expense for such vehicles, however, typically the acquisition cost is higher. Incentives received from the manufacturers for purchases of vehicles reduce the cost.\nFor all other vehicles, we use historical experience, industry residual value guidebooks and the monitoring of market conditions to set depreciation rates. Generally, when revenue earning vehicles are acquired outside of a vehicle repurchase program, (i.e., non-program vehicles) we estimate the period that we will hold the asset, primarily based on historical measures of the amount of rental activity (e.g., automobile mileage) and the targeted age of vehicles at\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nthe time of disposal. We also estimate the residual value of the applicable revenue earning vehicles at the expected time of disposal. The residual values for rental vehicles are affected by many factors, including make, model and options, age, physical condition, mileage, sale location, time of the year and channel of disposition (e.g., auction, retail, dealer direct). Depreciation is recorded over the estimated holding period. Depreciation rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis based on management's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions, their effect on residual values at the expected time of disposal and the estimated holding periods. Market conditions for used vehicle sales can also be affected by external factors such as the economy, natural disasters, fuel prices, used vehicle supply levels, and incentives offered by manufacturers of new vehicles. These key factors are considered when estimating future residual values. Depreciation rates are adjusted prospectively through the remaining expected life. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we make periodic adjustments to depreciation rates of revenue earning vehicles in response to changing market conditions. Upon disposal of revenue earning vehicles, depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges in the accompanying statements of operations is adjusted for any difference between the net proceeds received and the remaining net book value and a corresponding gain or loss is recorded.\nWithin Donlen, revenue earning vehicles are leased under longer term agreements with our customers. These leases contain provisions whereby we have a contracted residual value guaranteed to us by the lessee, such that we rarely experience any economic gains or losses on the disposal of these vehicles. Donlen accounts for its lease contracts using the appropriate lease classifications.\nCOVID-19 may have a significant impact on the used-vehicle market, resulting in a material deterioration of residual values. This deterioration could impact our current fleet and sales plans resulting in changes to the holding period of our vehicles as well as our ability to dispose of vehicles in the period originally anticipated. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Bankruptcy Court may issue additional orders directing us to dispose of vehicles sooner than anticipated. Changes in any or all of these variables could cause a material change in our estimates regarding depreciation expense.\nSelf-insured Liabilities\nSelf-insured liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets include public liability, property damage, general liability, liability insurance supplement, personal accident insurance, and workers compensation. These represent an estimate for both reported accident claims not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Reserve requirements are based on rental volume and actuarial evaluations of historical accident claim experience and trends, as well as future projections of ultimate losses, expenses and administrative costs. The adequacy of the liability is regularly monitored based on evolving accident claim history and insurance related state legislation changes. If our estimates change or if actual results differ from these assumptions, the amount of the recorded liability is adjusted to reflect these results.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Definite and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nOn an annual basis as of October 1, and at interim periods when circumstances require as a result of a triggering event as defined by Accounting Standards Codification 350 - Intangibles, Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), we test the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by performing an impairment analysis. An impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value as determined using level 3 inputs under the GAAP fair value hierarchy. The reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates, including projected revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. We believe our valuation techniques and assumptions are reasonable for this purpose.\nFor goodwill, we determine the fair value using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment (the component level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit when they have similar economic characteristics. We have four reporting units: U.S. Rental Car, Europe Rental Car, Other International Rental Car and Donlen. Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nprojections, tax rates and terminal value rates. Discount rates are set by using the Weighted-Average Cost of Capital ( WACC\u201d) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data as well as Company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Our cash flow projections represent management's most recent planning assumptions, which are based on a combination of industry outlooks, views on general economic conditions, our expected pricing plans and expected future savings. Terminal value rates are determined using a common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and long-term growth rates.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of the Hertz and Dollar Thrifty tradenames. For tradenames, we determine the fair value using a relief-from-royalty income approach, which utilizes our revenue projections for each asset along with assumptions for royalty rates, tax rates and the WACC.\nA significant decline in either projected revenues, projected cash flows or increased discount rates (the WACC) used to determine fair value could result in an impairment charge.\nIn 2020, due to the impact related to COVID-19, our reduction in cash flow projections, the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and declines in the stock price of Hertz Global, we tested the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2020, and based on the quantitative test, no impairment was recorded. Due to uncertainty surrounding our financial ability to complete certain information technology projects as a result of COVID-19 and the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, we concluded in the second quarter of 2020 that there was an impairment of such technology-related intangible assets and capitalized cloud computing implementation costs, and recorded an impairment charge of $193 million in our corporate operations, representing a full impairment of the carrying value of such assets as of June 30, 2020 of $124 million and $69 million of technology-related intangible assets and other assets, respectively.\nWe also tested the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of our annual test date of October 1, 2020 and concluded that there was an impairment of the Hertz tradename in our International RAC segment and recorded charges of $20 million as of December 31, 2020. In 2019 the results of the annual impairment test as of October 1, 2019, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and tradenames were in excess of their carrying value by more than 10% in all instances; therefore, we concluded there was no impairment in 2019.\nFurther deterioration in the general economic conditions in the travel industry, our cash flows and our ability to obtain future financing to maintain our fleet or the weighted average cost of capital assumptions may result in an impairment charge to earnings in future periods. We will continue to closely monitor actual results versus our expectations as well as any significant changes in market events or conditions, including the impact of COVID-19 on our business and the travel industry, and the resulting impact to our assumptions about future estimated cash flows, and the weighted average cost of capital. If our expectations of the operating results, both in magnitude or timing, do not materialize, or if our weighted average cost of capital increases, we may be required to record goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges, which could be material.\nSubrogation Receivables\nSubrogation receivables represent recoveries that the Company is contractually entitled to receive for vehicle damage caused while a vehicle is on rent with a customer. The amount of subrogation receivables recorded by the Company reflects our best estimate of both billed and unbilled recoveries from customers and/or third parties and represents the amount of damage the Company expects to recover. We estimate recoveries based on the relationship between historical collection data from subrogation claims and total damage expense, as well as other inputs, such as historical recovery periods, average recovery rates, average recovery dollars and other qualitative facts and circumstances. The impact of COVID-19 could result in a deterioration of the credit worthiness of our customers and third-parties regarding our subrogation receivables, and as a result we could incur material write-offs or a reduction in future collections.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense or benefit, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are estimated and recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. Subsequent changes to enacted tax rates and changes to the global mix of operating results will result in changes to the tax rates used to calculate deferred taxes and any related valuation allowances. We record deferred tax assets for NOL carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions when applicable. Upon utilization of those carry forwards, the taxing authorities may examine the positions that led to the generation of those NOLs and determine that some of those losses are disallowed, which could result in additional income tax payable to us.\nWe evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. There is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within twelve months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.\nOur income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies,\" - \"Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nHertz Global Holdings, Inc. is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is The Hertz Corporation. Hertz Global consolidates Hertz for financial statement purposes, and Hertz comprises approximately the entire balance of Hertz Global's assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. In addition, Hertz's operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of Hertz Global's revenues and operating expenses. As such, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") that follows herein is for Hertz and also applies to Hertz Global in all material respects, unless otherwise noted. Differences between the operations and results of Hertz and Hertz Global are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d and the Company\u201d in this MD&A for disclosures that relate to all of Hertz and Hertz Global.\nThe statements in this MD&A regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\u201d The following MD&A provides information that we believe to be relevant to an understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. You should read the following MD&A together with the sections entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIn this MD&A we refer to the following non-GAAP measure and key metrics:\n\u2022Adjusted Corporate EBITDA - important non-GAAP measure to management because it allows management to assess the operational performance of our business, exclusive of certain items, and allows management to assess the performance of the entire business on the same basis as the segment measure of profitability. Management believes that it is important to investors for the same reasons it is important to management and because it allows investors to assess our operational performance on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA, the segment measure of profitability and accordingly a GAAP measure, is calculated exclusive of certain items which are largely consistent with those used in the calculation of Adjusted Corporate EBITDA.\n\u2022Depreciation Per Unit Per Month - important key metric to management and investors as depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges is one of our largest expenses for the vehicle rental business and is driven by the number of vehicles, expected residual values at the expected time of disposal and expected hold period of the vehicles. Depreciation Per Unit Per Month is reflective of how we are managing the costs of our vehicles and facilitates a comparison with other participants in the vehicle rental industry.\n\u2022Total Revenue Per Transaction Day (\"Total RPD,\" also referred to as \"pricing\") - important key metric to management and investors as it represents a measurement of the changes in underlying pricing in the vehicle rental business and encompasses the elements in vehicle rental pricing that management has the ability to control.\n\u2022Total Revenue Per Unit Per Month (\"Total RPU\") - important key metric to management and investors as it provides a measure of revenue productivity relative to the total number of vehicles in our fleet whether owned or leased (\"Average Vehicles\" or \"fleet capacity\").\n\u2022Transaction Days - important key metric to management and investors as it represents the number of revenue generating days (\"volume\"). It is used as a component to measure Total RPD and Vehicle Utilization. Transaction Days represent the total number of 24-hour periods, with any partial period counted\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nas one Transaction Day, that vehicles were on rent (the period between when a rental contract is opened and closed) in a given period. Thus, it is possible for a vehicle to attain more than one Transaction Day in a 24-hour period.\n\u2022Vehicle Utilization - important key metric to management and investors because it is the measurement of the proportion of our vehicles that are being used to generate revenues relative to fleet capacity. Higher Vehicle Utilization means more vehicles are being utilized to generate revenues.\nOur non-GAAP measure and key metrics should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The above non-GAAP measure and key metrics are defined, and the non-GAAP measure is reconciled to its most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, in the \"Footnotes to the Results of Operations and Selected Operating Data by Segment Tables\" section of this MD&A.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, affecting multiple global regions. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses around the world. In an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19, many governments around the world placed significant restrictions on travel, individuals voluntarily reduced their air and other travel in attempts to avoid the outbreak and many businesses announced closures and imposed travel restrictions. There is continued uncertainty about the duration of the negative impact from COVID-19 and the length and scope of travel restrictions and business closures imposed by governments of impacted countries and voluntarily undertaken by private businesses.\nIn response to COVID-19, we began aggressively managing costs and (i) initiated a restructuring program affecting approximately 11,000 employees in our U.S. RAC segment and U.S. corporate operations; (ii) actively negotiated to abate or defer our airport rent and concession payments; (iii) substantially reduced capital expenditures; (iv) eliminated discretionary marketing spend; and (v) reduced our commitments to purchase vehicles by approximately $4.0 billion from original commitments in our U.S. RAC segment.\nAlthough we took aggressive action to eliminate costs, we faced significant ongoing monthly expenses, including monthly payments under our Operating Lease, pursuant to which Hertz leases vehicles which we use in our U.S. RAC rental car operations. On April 27, 2020, Hertz did not make certain payments in accordance with the Operating Lease, and as a result, an amortization event was in effect as of May 5, 2020 for all series of notes issued by HVF II and a liquidation event was in effect with respect to the Series 2013-A Notes issued by HVF II. Refer to Note 1, \"Background,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for additional information on the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver Agreements which expired on May 22, 2020.\nVoluntary Petitions for Bankruptcy\nIn connection with the expiration of the Forbearance Agreement and the Waiver Agreements described above and the continuing economic impact from COVID-19, on the Petition Date, the Debtors filed Petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered by the Bankruptcy Court under the caption In re The Hertz Corporation, et al., Case No. 20-11218 (MFW). Additional information about the Chapter 11 Cases, including access to documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court, is available online at https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/hertz, a website administered by Prime Clerk.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLiquidity Considerations Following the Chapter 11 Filing\nPer the terms of the Interim Lease Order entered on July 24, 2020, the Debtors were directed to, among other things, (i) make $650 million of base rent payments under the Operating Lease to the HVF trustee in the amount of six equal monthly payments of approximately $108 million commencing in July 2020 through December 2020; (ii) dispose of at least 182,521 lease vehicles between June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, inclusive, where the proceeds of the dispositions, subject to certain exclusions set forth in the Interim Lease Order, were to be used to make payments under the Operating Lease; (iii) fund interest payments on the Operating Lease from draws on certain existing letters of credit, which were reimbursable by the Debtors; and (iv) suspend litigation relating to the Operating Lease until January 15, 2021 with all parties reserving all rights with respect to future litigation claims. For the period June 1, 2020 through December 31,2020, we disposed of approximately 198,000 lease vehicles pursuant to or otherwise in satisfaction of our vehicle disposition obligations under the Interim Lease Order. Also, refer to the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section below.\nOn October 12, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing Hertz and Donlen to enter into certain agreements in connection with a new asset-based securitization facility with DFLF for the purposes of new interim fleet financing. On October 16, 2020, DFLF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $400 million pursuant to this new facility, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nOn October 29, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the Debtors to obtain certain debtor-in-possession financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on October 30, 2020, Hertz, as borrower, and Hertz Global and certain of its subsidiaries located in the U.S. and Canada, in each case that are debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases, as guarantors, entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. The DIP Credit Agreement provides for a superpriority secured debtor-in-possession credit facility comprised of the DIP Loans, of which (i) up to $1.0 billion can be used as equity for new interim fleet financing, giving the Debtors the ability to replenish their vehicle fleet in the future, and (ii) up to $800 million can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The DIP Loans are available in multiple draws of at least (i) $250 million each or (ii) the remaining available commitments if such commitments are less than $250 million. The DIP Loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 7.25% (subject to a 1.00% floor), which is reduced to LIBOR plus 6.75% upon a significant repayment of Pre-petition first lien debt. As of December 31, 2020, Hertz drew down $250 million from the DIP Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further details. On February 16, 2021, Hertz borrowed an additional $250 million as per the minimum draw requirement of the DIP Credit Agreement.\nOn November 24, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the formation of HVIF and for the Debtors to obtain interim fleet financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on November 25, 2020, HVIF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $4.0 billion, as further described in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nIn 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Lease Rejection Orders which were comprised of 359 off airport locations and 66 airport locations in our U.S. RAC segment, as further disclosed in Note 10, \"Leases,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further details. As a result of the Lease Rejection Orders, we have been consolidating our off airport rental locations and will continue to do so in 2021.\nOn January 20, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court authorized the Second Lease Order, which extended the forbearance period related to the Operating Lease to September 30, 2021, provided that the Debtors dispose of 121,510 lease vehicles, at least 113,381 of which will be non-program vehicles, and reach a minimum cumulative vehicle disposition proceeds of $2.0 billion by September 30, 2021. Additionally, the Second Lease Order directed the Debtors to (i) have no more than 157,262 lease vehicles by September 30, 2021 and (ii) make $756 million of base\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nrent payments under the Operating Lease to the HVF trustee in the amount of nine equal monthly payments of $84 million commencing in January 2021 through September 2021.\nOn January 28, 2021, Hertz subsidiary, TCL Funding Limited Partnership, entered into the Funding LP Series 2021-A Notes which provide for aggregate maximum borrowings of CAD$350 million on a revolving basis, subject to availability. The initial draw of CAD$120 million was used, in part, to pay the outstanding obligations under the Funding LP Series 2015-A Notes, including any unpaid default interest, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nAs a result of our actions to eliminate costs in 2020, we (i) negotiated rent concessions in the form of abatement and payment deferrals of fixed and variable rent payments for our airport and off airport locations in the amount of approximately $300 million which substantially represents amounts previously due in 2020; (ii) reduced our revenue earning vehicle expenditures by $8.2 billion, or 60%, in 2020 compared to 2019; (iii) reduced our non-vehicle capital asset expenditures by $126 million, or 56%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a reduction in information technology and finance transformation program costs; and (iv) sold approximately 308,000, or 6%, more vehicles in our U.S. RAC segment in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the Interim Lease Order. We continue to review our cost structure and fleet size to align with expected rental car volumes.\nNYSE Delisting\nAs a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, on October 29, 2020, the NYSE informed us that Hertz Global common stock was no longer suitable for listing on the NYSE and that the NYSE suspended trading of Hertz Global common stock (NYSE ticker symbol: HTZ) after the market close on October 29, 2020. Hertz Global common stock began trading exclusively on the over-the-counter market on October 30, 2020 under the symbol HTZGQ and was delisted from the NYSE on November 10, 2020 pursuant to Form 25. Upon deregistration of Hertz Global common stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, Hertz Global common stock remains registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.\nOur Business\nWe are engaged principally in the business of renting vehicles primarily through our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands. In addition to vehicle rental, we provide integrated vehicle leasing and fleet management solutions through our Donlen subsidiary, where in the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets as discussed below. Our profitability is primarily a function of the volume, mix and pricing of rental transactions and the utilization of vehicles, the related ownership cost of vehicles and other operating costs. Significant changes in the purchase price or residual values of vehicles or interest rates can have a significant effect on our profitability depending on our ability to adjust pricing for these changes. We continue to balance our mix of non-program and program vehicles based on market conditions, including residual values. Our business requires significant expenditures for vehicles, and as such, we require substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures. However, as a result of the Interim Lease Order, Hertz was directed to dispose of at least 182,521 lease vehicles between June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, where the proceeds from the dispositions were to be used to make payments under the Operating Lease. For the period from June 1, 2020 through December 31,2020, we disposed of approximately 198,000 lease vehicles pursuant to or otherwise in satisfaction of our vehicle disposition obligations under the Interim Lease Order. Additionally, under the Second Lease Order issued in January 2021, Hertz was directed to dispose of an additional 121,510 lease vehicles between January 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021, where the proceeds from the dispositions will be used to make payments under the Operating Lease. See the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section of this MD&A for further information.\nOur strategy includes optimization of our vehicle rental operations, disciplined performance management and evaluation of all locations and the pursuit of same-store sales growth.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nOur total revenues are primarily derived from rental and related charges and consist of:\n\u2022Worldwide vehicle rental revenues - revenues from all company-operated vehicle rental operations, including charges to customers for the reimbursement of costs incurred relating to airport concession fees and vehicle license fees, the fueling of vehicles and revenues associated with value-added services, including the sale of loss or collision damage waivers, theft protection, liability and personal accident/effects insurance coverage, premium emergency roadside service and other products and fees. Also included are ancillary revenues associated with retail vehicle sales and certain royalty fees from our franchisees (such fees are less than 2% of total revenues each period); and\n\u2022All other operations revenues - revenues from vehicle leasing and fleet management services by our Donlen business and other business activities, which in the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets as discussed below.\nOur expenses primarily consist of:\n\u2022Direct vehicle and operating expense (\"DOE\"), primarily wages and related benefits; commissions and concession fees paid to airport authorities, travel agents and others; facility, self-insurance and reservation costs; and other costs relating to the operation and rental of revenue earning vehicles, such as damage, maintenance and fuel costs;\n\u2022Depreciation expense and lease charges relating to revenue earning vehicles, including costs associated with the disposal of vehicles;\n\u2022Selling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\"), which includes costs for advertising costs and administrative personnel costs, along with information technology and finance transformation programs;\n\u2022Interest expense, net; and\n\u2022Reorganization items, net, which includes charges associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, primarily professional fees.\nOur Business Segments\nWe have identified three reportable segments, which are organized based on the products and services provided by our operating segments and the geographic areas in which our operating segments conduct business, as follows:\n\u2022U.S. RAC - Rental of vehicles, as well as sales of value-added services, in the U.S.;\n\u2022International RAC - Rental and leasing of vehicles, as well as sales of value-added services, internationally; and\n\u2022All Other Operations - Comprised primarily of our Donlen business, which provides vehicle leasing and fleet management services, and other business activities. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets. Accordingly, the Donlen Assets have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. See Note 3, \"Divestitures,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further information.\nIn addition to the above reportable segments, we have Corporate operations. We assess performance and allocate resources based upon the financial information for our operating segments.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRevenue Earning Vehicles\nRevenue earning vehicles used in our rental and leasing operations are recorded at cost, net of related discounts and incentives from manufacturers. Holding periods typically range from six to thirty-six months. Also included in revenue earning vehicles are vehicles placed on our retail lots for sale or actively in the process of being sold through other disposition channels.\nProgram vehicles are purchased under repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs with vehicle manufacturers wherein the manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during established repurchase periods, subject to, among other things, certain vehicle condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Guaranteed depreciation programs guarantee the residual value of the program vehicle upon sale, subject to, among other things, certain vehicle condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Program vehicles generally provide us with flexibility to increase or reduce the size of our fleet based on market demand. When we increase the percentage of program vehicles, the average age of our fleet decreases since the average holding period for program vehicles is shorter than that for non-program vehicles.\nWhen a revenue earning vehicle is acquired outside of a vehicle repurchase program, we estimate the period that we will hold the asset, primarily based on historical measures of the amount of rental activity (e.g., automobile mileage). We also estimate the residual value of the applicable revenue earning vehicles at the expected time of disposal, considering factors such as make, model and options, age, physical condition, mileage, sale location, time of the year and channel of disposition (e.g., auction, retail, dealer direct) and market conditions. The vehicle is depreciated using a rate based on these estimates. Depreciation rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis based on management's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions, their effect on residual values at the expected time of disposal and the estimated holding period of the vehicle. Differences between actual residual values and those estimated result in an adjustment to depreciation upon disposition of the vehicle. Our depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges also includes costs associated with the disposal of vehicles and rents paid for vehicles leased.\nWe dispose of our non-program vehicles via auction, dealer-direct and our retail locations. Non-program vehicles disposed of through our retail locations allow us the opportunity for value-added revenue, such as warranty, financing and title fees. We periodically review and adjust the mix between program and non-program vehicles in our fleet based on contract negotiations and the economic environment pertaining to our industry in an effort to optimize the mix of vehicles. Additionally, the use of program vehicles reduces the volatility associated with residual value estimation.\n2020 Operating Overview\nCOVID-19 has caused a substantial reduction to airline travel during 2020. As a large portion of our business is generated at airport locations, these disruptions have had, and we expect it to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our results of operations until such travel returns to historic levels.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nHertz Global Holdings, Inc. is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is The Hertz Corporation. Hertz Global consolidates Hertz for financial statement purposes, and Hertz comprises approximately the entire balance of Hertz Global's assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. In addition, Hertz's operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of Hertz Global's revenues and operating expenses. As such, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") that follows herein is for Hertz and also applies to Hertz Global in all material respects, unless otherwise noted. Differences between the operations and results of Hertz and Hertz Global are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d and the Company\u201d in this MD&A for disclosures that relate to all of Hertz and Hertz Global.\nThe statements in this MD&A regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\u201d The following MD&A provides information that we believe to be relevant to an understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. You should read the following MD&A together with the sections entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIn this MD&A we refer to the following non-GAAP measure and key metrics:\n\u2022Adjusted Corporate EBITDA - important non-GAAP measure to management because it allows management to assess the operational performance of our business, exclusive of certain items, and allows management to assess the performance of the entire business on the same basis as the segment measure of profitability. Management believes that it is important to investors for the same reasons it is important to management and because it allows investors to assess our operational performance on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA, the segment measure of profitability and accordingly a GAAP measure, is calculated exclusive of certain items which are largely consistent with those used in the calculation of Adjusted Corporate EBITDA.\n\u2022Depreciation Per Unit Per Month - important key metric to management and investors as depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges is one of our largest expenses for the vehicle rental business and is driven by the number of vehicles, expected residual values at the expected time of disposal and expected hold period of the vehicles. Depreciation Per Unit Per Month is reflective of how we are managing the costs of our vehicles and facilitates a comparison with other participants in the vehicle rental industry.\n\u2022Total Revenue Per Transaction Day (\"Total RPD,\" also referred to as \"pricing\") - important key metric to management and investors as it represents a measurement of the changes in underlying pricing in the vehicle rental business and encompasses the elements in vehicle rental pricing that management has the ability to control.\n\u2022Total Revenue Per Unit Per Month (\"Total RPU\") - important key metric to management and investors as it provides a measure of revenue productivity relative to the total number of vehicles in our fleet whether owned or leased (\"Average Vehicles\" or \"fleet capacity\").\n\u2022Transaction Days - important key metric to management and investors as it represents the number of revenue generating days (\"volume\"). It is used as a component to measure Total RPD and Vehicle Utilization. Transaction Days represent the total number of 24-hour periods, with any partial period counted\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nas one Transaction Day, that vehicles were on rent (the period between when a rental contract is opened and closed) in a given period. Thus, it is possible for a vehicle to attain more than one Transaction Day in a 24-hour period.\n\u2022Vehicle Utilization - important key metric to management and investors because it is the measurement of the proportion of our vehicles that are being used to generate revenues relative to fleet capacity. Higher Vehicle Utilization means more vehicles are being utilized to generate revenues.\nOur non-GAAP measure and key metrics should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The above non-GAAP measure and key metrics are defined, and the non-GAAP measure is reconciled to its most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, in the \"Footnotes to the Results of Operations and Selected Operating Data by Segment Tables\" section of this MD&A.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, affecting multiple global regions. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses around the world. In an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19, many governments around the world placed significant restrictions on travel, individuals voluntarily reduced their air and other travel in attempts to avoid the outbreak and many businesses announced closures and imposed travel restrictions. There is continued uncertainty about the duration of the negative impact from COVID-19 and the length and scope of travel restrictions and business closures imposed by governments of impacted countries and voluntarily undertaken by private businesses.\nIn response to COVID-19, we began aggressively managing costs and (i) initiated a restructuring program affecting approximately 11,000 employees in our U.S. RAC segment and U.S. corporate operations; (ii) actively negotiated to abate or defer our airport rent and concession payments; (iii) substantially reduced capital expenditures; (iv) eliminated discretionary marketing spend; and (v) reduced our commitments to purchase vehicles by approximately $4.0 billion from original commitments in our U.S. RAC segment.\nAlthough we took aggressive action to eliminate costs, we faced significant ongoing monthly expenses, including monthly payments under our Operating Lease, pursuant to which Hertz leases vehicles which we use in our U.S. RAC rental car operations. On April 27, 2020, Hertz did not make certain payments in accordance with the Operating Lease, and as a result, an amortization event was in effect as of May 5, 2020 for all series of notes issued by HVF II and a liquidation event was in effect with respect to the Series 2013-A Notes issued by HVF II. Refer to Note 1, \"Background,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for additional information on the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver Agreements which expired on May 22, 2020.\nVoluntary Petitions for Bankruptcy\nIn connection with the expiration of the Forbearance Agreement and the Waiver Agreements described above and the continuing economic impact from COVID-19, on the Petition Date, the Debtors filed Petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered by the Bankruptcy Court under the caption In re The Hertz Corporation, et al., Case No. 20-11218 (MFW). Additional information about the Chapter 11 Cases, including access to documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court, is available online at https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/hertz, a website administered by Prime Clerk.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLiquidity Considerations Following the Chapter 11 Filing\nPer the terms of the Interim Lease Order entered on July 24, 2020, the Debtors were directed to, among other things, (i) make $650 million of base rent payments under the Operating Lease to the HVF trustee in the amount of six equal monthly payments of approximately $108 million commencing in July 2020 through December 2020; (ii) dispose of at least 182,521 lease vehicles between June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, inclusive, where the proceeds of the dispositions, subject to certain exclusions set forth in the Interim Lease Order, were to be used to make payments under the Operating Lease; (iii) fund interest payments on the Operating Lease from draws on certain existing letters of credit, which were reimbursable by the Debtors; and (iv) suspend litigation relating to the Operating Lease until January 15, 2021 with all parties reserving all rights with respect to future litigation claims. For the period June 1, 2020 through December 31,2020, we disposed of approximately 198,000 lease vehicles pursuant to or otherwise in satisfaction of our vehicle disposition obligations under the Interim Lease Order. Also, refer to the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section below.\nOn October 12, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing Hertz and Donlen to enter into certain agreements in connection with a new asset-based securitization facility with DFLF for the purposes of new interim fleet financing. On October 16, 2020, DFLF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $400 million pursuant to this new facility, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nOn October 29, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the Debtors to obtain certain debtor-in-possession financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on October 30, 2020, Hertz, as borrower, and Hertz Global and certain of its subsidiaries located in the U.S. and Canada, in each case that are debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases, as guarantors, entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. The DIP Credit Agreement provides for a superpriority secured debtor-in-possession credit facility comprised of the DIP Loans, of which (i) up to $1.0 billion can be used as equity for new interim fleet financing, giving the Debtors the ability to replenish their vehicle fleet in the future, and (ii) up to $800 million can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The DIP Loans are available in multiple draws of at least (i) $250 million each or (ii) the remaining available commitments if such commitments are less than $250 million. The DIP Loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 7.25% (subject to a 1.00% floor), which is reduced to LIBOR plus 6.75% upon a significant repayment of Pre-petition first lien debt. As of December 31, 2020, Hertz drew down $250 million from the DIP Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further details. On February 16, 2021, Hertz borrowed an additional $250 million as per the minimum draw requirement of the DIP Credit Agreement.\nOn November 24, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the formation of HVIF and for the Debtors to obtain interim fleet financing. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, on November 25, 2020, HVIF issued the Series 2020-1 Notes in an aggregate principal amount up to $4.0 billion, as further described in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nIn 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Lease Rejection Orders which were comprised of 359 off airport locations and 66 airport locations in our U.S. RAC segment, as further disclosed in Note 10, \"Leases,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further details. As a result of the Lease Rejection Orders, we have been consolidating our off airport rental locations and will continue to do so in 2021.\nOn January 20, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court authorized the Second Lease Order, which extended the forbearance period related to the Operating Lease to September 30, 2021, provided that the Debtors dispose of 121,510 lease vehicles, at least 113,381 of which will be non-program vehicles, and reach a minimum cumulative vehicle disposition proceeds of $2.0 billion by September 30, 2021. Additionally, the Second Lease Order directed the Debtors to (i) have no more than 157,262 lease vehicles by September 30, 2021 and (ii) make $756 million of base\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nrent payments under the Operating Lease to the HVF trustee in the amount of nine equal monthly payments of $84 million commencing in January 2021 through September 2021.\nOn January 28, 2021, Hertz subsidiary, TCL Funding Limited Partnership, entered into the Funding LP Series 2021-A Notes which provide for aggregate maximum borrowings of CAD$350 million on a revolving basis, subject to availability. The initial draw of CAD$120 million was used, in part, to pay the outstanding obligations under the Funding LP Series 2015-A Notes, including any unpaid default interest, as disclosed in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report.\nAs a result of our actions to eliminate costs in 2020, we (i) negotiated rent concessions in the form of abatement and payment deferrals of fixed and variable rent payments for our airport and off airport locations in the amount of approximately $300 million which substantially represents amounts previously due in 2020; (ii) reduced our revenue earning vehicle expenditures by $8.2 billion, or 60%, in 2020 compared to 2019; (iii) reduced our non-vehicle capital asset expenditures by $126 million, or 56%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a reduction in information technology and finance transformation program costs; and (iv) sold approximately 308,000, or 6%, more vehicles in our U.S. RAC segment in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the Interim Lease Order. We continue to review our cost structure and fleet size to align with expected rental car volumes.\nNYSE Delisting\nAs a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, on October 29, 2020, the NYSE informed us that Hertz Global common stock was no longer suitable for listing on the NYSE and that the NYSE suspended trading of Hertz Global common stock (NYSE ticker symbol: HTZ) after the market close on October 29, 2020. Hertz Global common stock began trading exclusively on the over-the-counter market on October 30, 2020 under the symbol HTZGQ and was delisted from the NYSE on November 10, 2020 pursuant to Form 25. Upon deregistration of Hertz Global common stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, Hertz Global common stock remains registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.\nOur Business\nWe are engaged principally in the business of renting vehicles primarily through our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands. In addition to vehicle rental, we provide integrated vehicle leasing and fleet management solutions through our Donlen subsidiary, where in the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets as discussed below. Our profitability is primarily a function of the volume, mix and pricing of rental transactions and the utilization of vehicles, the related ownership cost of vehicles and other operating costs. Significant changes in the purchase price or residual values of vehicles or interest rates can have a significant effect on our profitability depending on our ability to adjust pricing for these changes. We continue to balance our mix of non-program and program vehicles based on market conditions, including residual values. Our business requires significant expenditures for vehicles, and as such, we require substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures. However, as a result of the Interim Lease Order, Hertz was directed to dispose of at least 182,521 lease vehicles between June 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, where the proceeds from the dispositions were to be used to make payments under the Operating Lease. For the period from June 1, 2020 through December 31,2020, we disposed of approximately 198,000 lease vehicles pursuant to or otherwise in satisfaction of our vehicle disposition obligations under the Interim Lease Order. Additionally, under the Second Lease Order issued in January 2021, Hertz was directed to dispose of an additional 121,510 lease vehicles between January 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021, where the proceeds from the dispositions will be used to make payments under the Operating Lease. See the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section of this MD&A for further information.\nOur strategy includes optimization of our vehicle rental operations, disciplined performance management and evaluation of all locations and the pursuit of same-store sales growth.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nOur total revenues are primarily derived from rental and related charges and consist of:\n\u2022Worldwide vehicle rental revenues - revenues from all company-operated vehicle rental operations, including charges to customers for the reimbursement of costs incurred relating to airport concession fees and vehicle license fees, the fueling of vehicles and revenues associated with value-added services, including the sale of loss or collision damage waivers, theft protection, liability and personal accident/effects insurance coverage, premium emergency roadside service and other products and fees. Also included are ancillary revenues associated with retail vehicle sales and certain royalty fees from our franchisees (such fees are less than 2% of total revenues each period); and\n\u2022All other operations revenues - revenues from vehicle leasing and fleet management services by our Donlen business and other business activities, which in the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets as discussed below.\nOur expenses primarily consist of:\n\u2022Direct vehicle and operating expense (\"DOE\"), primarily wages and related benefits; commissions and concession fees paid to airport authorities, travel agents and others; facility, self-insurance and reservation costs; and other costs relating to the operation and rental of revenue earning vehicles, such as damage, maintenance and fuel costs;\n\u2022Depreciation expense and lease charges relating to revenue earning vehicles, including costs associated with the disposal of vehicles;\n\u2022Selling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\"), which includes costs for advertising costs and administrative personnel costs, along with information technology and finance transformation programs;\n\u2022Interest expense, net; and\n\u2022Reorganization items, net, which includes charges associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, primarily professional fees.\nOur Business Segments\nWe have identified three reportable segments, which are organized based on the products and services provided by our operating segments and the geographic areas in which our operating segments conduct business, as follows:\n\u2022U.S. RAC - Rental of vehicles, as well as sales of value-added services, in the U.S.;\n\u2022International RAC - Rental and leasing of vehicles, as well as sales of value-added services, internationally; and\n\u2022All Other Operations - Comprised primarily of our Donlen business, which provides vehicle leasing and fleet management services, and other business activities. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets. Accordingly, the Donlen Assets have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. See Note 3, \"Divestitures,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this 2020 Annual Report for further information.\nIn addition to the above reportable segments, we have Corporate operations. We assess performance and allocate resources based upon the financial information for our operating segments.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nRevenue Earning Vehicles\nRevenue earning vehicles used in our rental and leasing operations are recorded at cost, net of related discounts and incentives from manufacturers. Holding periods typically range from six to thirty-six months. Also included in revenue earning vehicles are vehicles placed on our retail lots for sale or actively in the process of being sold through other disposition channels.\nProgram vehicles are purchased under repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs with vehicle manufacturers wherein the manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during established repurchase periods, subject to, among other things, certain vehicle condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Guaranteed depreciation programs guarantee the residual value of the program vehicle upon sale, subject to, among other things, certain vehicle condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Program vehicles generally provide us with flexibility to increase or reduce the size of our fleet based on market demand. When we increase the percentage of program vehicles, the average age of our fleet decreases since the average holding period for program vehicles is shorter than that for non-program vehicles.\nWhen a revenue earning vehicle is acquired outside of a vehicle repurchase program, we estimate the period that we will hold the asset, primarily based on historical measures of the amount of rental activity (e.g., automobile mileage). We also estimate the residual value of the applicable revenue earning vehicles at the expected time of disposal, considering factors such as make, model and options, age, physical condition, mileage, sale location, time of the year and channel of disposition (e.g., auction, retail, dealer direct) and market conditions. The vehicle is depreciated using a rate based on these estimates. Depreciation rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis based on management's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions, their effect on residual values at the expected time of disposal and the estimated holding period of the vehicle. Differences between actual residual values and those estimated result in an adjustment to depreciation upon disposition of the vehicle. Our depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges also includes costs associated with the disposal of vehicles and rents paid for vehicles leased.\nWe dispose of our non-program vehicles via auction, dealer-direct and our retail locations. Non-program vehicles disposed of through our retail locations allow us the opportunity for value-added revenue, such as warranty, financing and title fees. We periodically review and adjust the mix between program and non-program vehicles in our fleet based on contract negotiations and the economic environment pertaining to our industry in an effort to optimize the mix of vehicles. Additionally, the use of program vehicles reduces the volatility associated with residual value estimation.\n2020 Operating Overview\nCOVID-19 has caused a substantial reduction to airline travel during 2020. As a large portion of our business is generated at airport locations, these disruptions have had, and we expect it to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our results of operations until such travel returns to historic levels.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

Not meaningful\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nTotal revenues decreased $4.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 due to reduced demand related to the impact from COVID-19 where there were decreases of $3.3 billion and $1.2 billion in our U.S. RAC and International RAC segments, respectively. U.S. RAC revenues decreased due primarily to lower volume. Excluding a $5 million impact of fx, revenues for our International RAC segment decreased $1.2 billion also due primarily to lower volume and pricing.\nDOE decreased $1.9 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to decreases of $1.3 billion and $570 million in our U.S. RAC and International RAC segments, respectively. The decrease in our U.S. RAC segment is due primarily to lower volume driven by the impact from COVID-19 on total revenues described above, lower personnel costs and other cost elimination initiatives. Excluding the $3 million impact of fx, DOE for International RAC decreased $573 million due primarily to lower volume driven by the impact from COVID-19 on total revenues described above and lower personnel costs due to employee furloughs and associated government support across Europe related to COVID-19.\nDepreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges decreased $533 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to decreases of $333 million and $165 million in our U.S. RAC and International RAC segments, respectively. The decreases in our U.S. RAC and International RAC segments are due primarily to a reduction in fleet size in response to pandemic-related declines in consumer demand.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.
