MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nEastGroup's goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider in its markets of functional, flexible and quality business distribution space for location-sensitive customers (primarily in the 15,000 to 70,000 square foot range). The Company develops, acquires and operates distribution facilities, the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply-constrained submarkets in major Sunbelt regions. The Company's core markets are in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Global, national and local economies continue to be impacted by the pandemic and the mitigation efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19.\nDuring the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant health, social and economic impacts from COVID-19. EastGroup's operations, occupancy and rent collections have remained substantially stable during this period. As of February 16, 2021, the Company has received rent relief requests, primarily in the form of payment deferral requests, from approximately 28% of its customers based on rental revenue. These requests have largely ended; for comparison, this is only a slight increase from 26% at the end of April 2020 during the beginning of the pandemic. To date, approximately 18% of these requests have been granted some form of relief, which represents approximately 5% of the Company's customers on a square foot basis. The Company has executed rent deferral agreements totaling $1.7 million, which represents approximately 0.4% of the Company's 2020 revenue. The deferrals all relate to 2020 rental income with no future period deferred rents. The terms differ for each deferral agreement, and all deferred rent payments that were due through December 31, 2020 have been collected with the exception of $27,000. As of February 16, 2021, 59% of total deferred rent has been collected. Under modified COVID-19-related guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), rental income for the majority of these deferral agreements ($1.4 million of the $1.7 million) qualifies to be recognized as rental income in the periods in which it was charged under the original terms of the leases. When requests were made, they were handled on a case-by-case basis, and the Company's responses were dependent on its understanding of the financial strength of the customer, the operational and earnings impacts being experienced by the customer, and the customer's ability or inability to obtain capital through debt or equity issuances, government assistance programs or by other means. As of February 16, 2021, rent payment deferrals representing approximately 0.4% of the Company's 2020 revenue have not been significant; the Company is continuing to actively monitor the evolving COVID-19 situation and its impact on the Company's cash flows and operations.\nAs of February 16, 2021, the Company's rent collection and rent payment deferral status was as follows:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Rent Collected(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>% of Uncollected Rent Deferred to Future Period </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Uncollected Rent With No Deferral Agreement </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q1 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q2 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q3 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 2021(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>95.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Customer payments are received daily. The collection information presented is current through February 16, 2021, and the Company anticipates continuing to receive payments which will increase the % of Rent Collected.\n(2) Represents the period of February 1, 2021 through February 16, 2021 and assumes collections from government-related tenants. For comparison, as of February 16, 2021, February rental receipts are slightly higher than the January rental receipts were as of January 16, 2021.\nWe believe EastGroup's financial condition and balance sheet remain strong. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the Company's $395 million unsecured revolving credit facilities was $125 million, providing $270 million of available capacity. During 2020, EastGroup has only drawn amounts on its unsecured revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants at December 31, 2020 and anticipates remaining in compliance for the foreseeable future. The Company's recent debt and equity activity is further described under Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nThe Company has been continuing construction on already-active development and value-add projects. During the second and third quarters of 2020, EastGroup did not begin construction on any new development projects. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started construction on three new development projects. Management will continue to monitor the economic conditions of the Company's markets to determine whether to begin construction on additional future development projects.\nThe future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company are largely dependent on the severity and duration of the economic uncertainty and its effect on EastGroup's customers and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.\nGeneral\nThe Company believes its current operating cash flow and unsecured bank credit facilities provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company, and the Company also believes it can issue common and/or preferred equity and obtain debt financing. During 2020, EastGroup issued 709,924 shares of common stock through its continuous common equity offering program, providing net proceeds to the Company of $92.7 million. Also during 2020, the Company closed on a private placement of $175 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.65% and a $100 million senior unsecured term loan with an effective fixed interest rate of 2.39%. EastGroup's financing and equity issuances are further described in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nThe Company's primary revenue is rental income. During 2020, EastGroup executed leases on 8,118,000 square feet (18.5% of EastGroup's total square footage of 43,854,000 as of December 31, 2020). For new and renewal leases signed during 2020, average rental rates increased by 21.7% as compared to the former leases on the same spaces.\nProperty Net Operating Income ( PNOI\u201d) Excluding Income from Lease Terminations from same properties (defined as operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods - January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020), increased 2.1% for 2020 compared to 2019.\nEastGroup's portfolio was 98.0% leased at December 31, 2020 compared to 97.6% at December 31, 2019. As of February 16, 2021, the portfolio was 97.9% leased and 96.7% occupied. Leases scheduled to expire in 2021 were 14.9% of the portfolio on a square foot basis at December 31, 2020, and this percentage was reduced to 12.2% as of February 16, 2021.\nThe Company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its development and acquisition programs. The Company mitigates risks associated with development through a Board-approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity.\nDuring 2020, EastGroup acquired 509,000 square feet of operating and value-add properties in Atlanta, Dallas, Austin and Los Angeles and 232.6 acres of land in Orlando, Fort Myers, Atlanta, Dallas and El Paso for a total of $122.2 million. The Company began construction of 5 development projects containing 851,000 square feet in Miami, Fort Myers, Charlotte, Dallas and Phoenix. Also in 2020, the Company transferred 18 development and value-add properties (2,360,000 square feet) in Tampa, Miami, Orlando, Fort Myers, Charlotte, Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Las Vegas and San Diego from its development and value-add program to real estate properties with costs of $249.4 million at the date of transfer. As of December 31, 2020, EastGroup's development and value-add program consisted of 16 projects (2,741,000 square feet) located in 10 cities. The projected total cost for the development and value-add projects, which were collectively 35% leased as of February 16, 2021, is $291.5 million, of which $65.5 million remained to be invested as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2020, EastGroup sold 126,000 square feet of operating properties, generating gross sales proceeds of $21.0 million. The Company recognized $13.1 million in Gain on sales of real estate investments during 2020.\nThe Company typically initially funds its development and acquisition programs through its $395 million unsecured bank credit facilities (as discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources). As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace short-term bank borrowings. In June 2019, Moody's Investors Service affirmed the Company's issuer rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. For future debt issuances, the Company intends to issue primarily unsecured fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital.\nEastGroup has one reportable segment - industrial properties. The Company's properties, primarily located in major Sunbelt regions of the United States, have similar economic characteristics and as a result, have been aggregated into one reportable segment.\nThe Company's chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions: (1) funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ( FFO\u201d), and (2) property net operating income ( PNOI\u201d).\nFFO is computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( Nareit\u201d). In December 2018, Nareit issued the Nareit Funds from Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement\u201d (the 2018 White Paper\u201d), which reaffirmed, and in some cases refined, Nareit's prior determinations concerning FFO. The guidance in the 2018 White Paper allows preparers an option as it pertains to whether gains or losses on sale, or impairment charges, on real estate assets incidental to a REIT's business are excluded from the calculation of FFO. EastGroup has made the election to exclude activity related to such assets that are incidental to our business. In 2019, the Company revised prior periods to reflect this guidance.\nFFO is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate property (including other assets incidental to the Company's business) and impairment losses, adjusted for real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is not considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company's financial performance, nor is it a measure of the Company's liquidity or indicative of funds available to provide for the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. The Company's key drivers affecting FFO are changes in PNOI (as discussed below), interest rates, the amount of leverage the Company employs and general and administrative expenses.\nPNOI is defined as Income from real estate operations less Expenses from real estate operations (including market-based internal management fee expense) plus the Company's share of income and property operating expenses from its less-than-wholly-owned real estate investments.\nEastGroup sometimes refers to PNOI from Same Properties as Same PNOI\u201d; the Company also presents Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations. Same Properties is defined as operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period. Properties developed or acquired are excluded until held in the operating portfolio for both the current and prior year reporting periods. Properties sold during the current or prior year reporting periods are also excluded. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Same Properties includes properties which were included in the operating portfolio for the entire period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. The Company presents Same PNOI and Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations as a property-level supplemental measure of performance used to evaluate the performance of the Company's investments in real estate assets and its operating results on a same property basis. It is calculated on a lease-by-lease basis by averaging the customers' rent payments over the life of each individual lease.\nFFO and PNOI are supplemental industry reporting measurements used to evaluate the performance of the Company's investments in real estate assets and its operating results. The Company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry's calculations of PNOI and FFO provides supplemental indicators of the properties' performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. PNOI and FFO as calculated by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d). Investors should be aware that items excluded from or added back to FFO are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance.\nPNOI was calculated as follows for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from real estate operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>362,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>330,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>299,018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses from real estate operations </td> <td>(103,368) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93,274) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86,394) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interest in PNOI of consolidated joint ventures </td> <td>(171) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(199) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(314) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNOI from 50% owned unconsolidated investment </td> <td>978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>869 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME ( PNOI\u201d) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>260,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>213,179 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome from real estate operations is comprised of rental income net of reserves for uncollectible rent, expense reimbursement pass-through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees. Expenses from real estate operations is comprised of property taxes, insurance, utilities, repair and maintenance expenses, management fees and other operating costs. Generally, the Company's most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance. Tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable, modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable, or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable (gross leases represent only a small portion of the Company's total leases). Increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases. Modified gross leases often include base year amounts, and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable. The Company's exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of Net Income to PNOI, Same PNOI and Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET INCOME </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of real estate investments </td> <td>(13,145) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,068) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,273) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of non-operating real estate </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(83) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of other assets </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(427) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on other </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>497 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>(101) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(129) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(156) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>(354) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(574) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,374) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indirect leasing costs </td> <td>661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>116,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,704 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company's share of depreciation from unconsolidated investment </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>33,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,106 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>14,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interest in PNOI of consolidated joint ventures </td> <td>(171) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(199) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(314) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME ( PNOI\u201d) </td> <td>260,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>213,179 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNOI from 2019 and 2020 Acquisitions </td> <td>(8,434) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,929) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNOI from 2019 and 2020 Development and Value-Add Properties </td> <td>(24,050) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,109) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNOI from 2019 and 2020 Operating Property Dispositions </td> <td>(1,081) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,787) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other PNOI </td> <td>257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SAME PNOI </td> <td>226,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease termination fee income from same properties </td> <td>(709) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,258) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SAME PNOI EXCLUDING INCOME FROM LEASE TERMINATIONS </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Same property metrics are not applicable to the year ended December 31, 2018, as the same property metrics for 2020 and 2019 are based on operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020).\nThe following table presents reconciliations of Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc.

For 2020, FFO was $5.38 per share compared with $4.98 per share for 2019, an increase of 8.0%.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, PNOI increased by $21,792,000, or 9.1%, compared to 2019. PNOI increased $15,941,000 from newly developed and value-add properties, $5,505,000 from 2019 and 2020 acquisitions and $4,062,000 from same property operations; PNOI decreased $3,706,000 from operating properties sold in 2019 and 2020.\n\u2022The change in Same PNOI represents the PNOI increase or decrease for the same operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020). Same PNOI, excluding income from lease terminations, increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019.\n\u2022Same property average occupancy represents the average month-end percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage for the same operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020). Same property average occupancy was 97.0% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\u2022Occupancy is the percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage as of the close of the reporting period. Occupancy at December 31, 2020 was 97.3%. Quarter-end occupancy ranged from 96.4% to 97.1% over the previous four quarters ended December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020.\n\u2022Rental rate change represents the rental rate increase or decrease on new and renewal leases compared to the prior leases on the same space. For the year 2020, rental rate increases on new and renewal leases (18.5% of total square footage) averaged 21.7%.\n\u2022Lease termination fee income is included in Income from real estate operations. For the year 2020, lease termination fee income was $709,000 compared to $1,336,000 for 2019.\n\u2022The Company records reserves for uncollectible rent as reductions to Income from real estate operations. The Company recorded reserves for uncollectible rent of $2,763,000 in 2020 compared to $448,000 in 2019. Individual leases are evaluated for collectibility at each reporting period. We evaluate the collectibility of rents and other receivables at each reporting period based on factors including, among others, tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions and trends in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the geographic area where the property is located. If evaluation of these factors or others indicates it is not probable we will collect substantially all rent we recognize an adjustment to rental revenue. If our judgment or estimation regarding probability of collection changes we may adjust or record additional rental revenue in the period such conclusion is reached. The Company followed its normal process for recording reserves for uncollectible rent during the year ended December 31, 2020 and also evaluated all deferred rent related to the COVID-19 pandemic for collectibility.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company's management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the Company.\nAcquisition and Development of Real Estate Properties\nThe FASB Codification provides guidance on how to properly determine the allocation of the purchase price among the individual components of both the tangible and intangible assets based on their relative fair values. Goodwill for business combinations is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. The allocation to tangible assets (land, building and improvements) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models. Land is valued using comparable land sales specific to the applicable market, provided by a third-party. The Company determines whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar properties. The cost of the properties acquired may be adjusted based on indebtedness assumed from the seller that is determined to be above or below market rates.\nThe purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets: the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships. The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term, and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current market rents over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based upon management's assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable.\nThe relevance of this accounting policy will fluctuate given the transaction activity during the period.\nFor properties under development and value-add properties acquired in the development stage, costs associated with development (i.e., land, construction costs, interest expense, property taxes and other costs associated with development) are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property. Included in these costs are management's estimates for the portions of internal costs (primarily personnel costs) deemed related to such development activities. The internal costs are allocated to specific development projects based on development activity.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nEastGroup's Total Assets were $2,720,803,000 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $174,725,000 from December 31, 2019. Total Liabilities increased $106,536,000 to $1,450,285,000, and Total Equity increased $68,189,000 to $1,270,518,000 during the same period. The following paragraphs explain these changes in detail.\nAssets\nReal Estate Properties\nReal estate properties increased $314,930,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to: (i) the transfer of 18 properties from Development and value-add properties to Real estate properties (as detailed under Development and Value-Add Properties below); (ii) operating property acquisitions; and (iii) capital improvements at the Company's properties. These increases were partially offset by the operating property sales discussed below.\nDuring 2020, EastGroup acquired the following operating properties:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES ACQUIRED IN 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Location </td> <td> </td> <td>Size </td> <td> </td> <td>Date\nAcquired </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Square feet) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Point One </td> <td> </td> <td>Austin, TX </td> <td> </td> <td>50,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>02/28/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,812 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cherokee 75 Business Center 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Atlanta, GA </td> <td> </td> <td>85,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12/15/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,909 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Rock </td> <td> </td> <td>Dallas, TX </td> <td> </td> <td>212,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12/17/2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>32,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Real Estate Property Acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>347,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Total cost of the operating properties acquired was $48,656,000, of which $46,240,000 was allocated to Real estate properties as indicated above. The Company allocated $7,385,000 of the total purchase price to land using third party land valuations for the Atlanta, Austin and Dallas markets. The market values are considered to be Level 3 inputs as defined by FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurement (see Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ASC 820). Intangibles associated with the purchases of real estate were allocated as follows: $2,624,000 to in-place lease intangibles and $104,000 to above market leases (both included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets), and $312,000 to below market leases (included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made capital improvements of $30,255,000 on existing and acquired properties (included in the Capital Expenditures table under Results of Operations). Also, the Company incurred costs of $5,743,000 on development and value-add projects subsequent to transfer to Real estate properties; the Company records these expenditures as development and value-add costs on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nEastGroup sold the following operating properties during 2020: University Business Center 120 in Santa Barbara and Central Green in Houston. The properties (126,000 square feet combined) were sold for $21 million and the Company recognized gains on the sales of $13.1 million.\nDevelopment and Value-Add Properties\nEastGroup's investment in Development and value-add properties at December 31, 2020 consisted of properties in lease-up and under construction of $225,964,000 and prospective development (primarily land) of $133,624,000. The Company's total investment in Development and value-add properties at December 31, 2020 was $359,588,000 compared to $419,999,000 at December 31, 2019. Total capital invested for development and value-add properties during 2020 was $195,446,000, which primarily consisted of costs of $170,418,000 as detailed in the Development and Value-Add Properties Activity table below, $18,550,000 as detailed in the Development and Value-Add Properties Transferred to the Real Estate Properties Portfolio During 2020 table below and costs of $5,743,000 on projects subsequent to transfer to Real estate properties. The capitalized costs incurred on development and value-add projects subsequent to transfer to Real estate properties include capital improvements at the properties and do not include other capitalized costs associated with development (i.e., interest expense, property taxes and internal personnel costs).\nEastGroup capitalized internal development costs of $6,689,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6,918,000 during 2019.\nDuring 2020, EastGroup acquired one value-add property, Rancho Distribution Center in Los Angeles. The total cost of the property acquired was $27,862,000, of which $27,320,000 was allocated to Development and value-add properties. The\nCompany allocated $16,180,000 of the total purchase price to land using third party land valuations for the Los Angeles market. The market values are considered to be Level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (see Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on ASC 820). Intangibles associated with the purchase were allocated as follows: $633,000 to in-place lease intangibles (included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets) and $91,000 to below market leases (included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets). These costs are amortized over the remaining lives of the associated leases in place at the time of acquisition. Costs associated with the value-add property acquisition, except for the amounts allocated to the acquired lease intangibles, are included in the Development and Value-Add Properties Activity table below.\nAlso during 2020, EastGroup purchased 232.6 acres of development land in Orlando, Fort Myers, Atlanta, Dallas and El Paso for $45,687,000. Costs associated with these acquisitions are included in the Development and Value-Add Properties Activity table. These increases were offset by the transfer of 18 development projects to Real estate properties during 2020 with a total investment of $249,379,000 as of the date of transfer.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DEVELOPMENT AND\nVALUE-ADD PROPERTIES ACTIVITY </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Costs Incurred </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Costs\nTransferred\nin 2020 (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>For the\nYear Ended\n12/31/20 </td> <td> </td> <td>Cumulative\nas of\n12/31/20 </td> <td> </td> <td>Projected\nTotal Costs (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Anticipated Building Conversion Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LEASE-UP </td> <td> </td> <td>Building Size (Square feet) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gilbert Crossroads A & B, Phoenix, AZ </td> <td> </td> <td>140,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>01/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rancho Distribution Center, Los Angeles, CA (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>162,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>03/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CreekView 121 7 & 8, Dallas, TX </td> <td> </td> <td>137,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>04/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hurricane Shoals 3, Atlanta, GA </td> <td> </td> <td>101,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>04/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>World Houston 44, Houston, TX </td> <td> </td> <td>134,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>05/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gateway 4, Miami, FL </td> <td> </td> <td>197,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>06/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interstate Commons 2, Phoenix, AZ (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>142,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>06/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tri-County Crossing 3 & 4, San Antonio, TX </td> <td> </td> <td>203,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>06/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northwest Crossing 1-3, Houston, TX </td> <td> </td> <td>278,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>09/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ridgeview 1 & 2, San Antonio, TX </td> <td> </td> <td>226,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Settlers Crossing 3 & 4, Austin, TX </td> <td> </td> <td>173,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10/21 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SunCoast 7, Ft.

Real estate properties held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell and are not depreciated while they are held for sale.\nThe Company did not classify any properties as held for sale as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIn accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360), Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, the Company would report a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when the component or group of components meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale or when the component or group of components is disposed of by sale or other than by sale. In addition, the Company would provide additional disclosures about both discontinued operations and the disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements. EastGroup performs an analysis of properties sold to determine whether the sales qualify for discontinued operations presentation.\nThe Company does not consider its sales in 2019 and 2020 to be disposals of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results.\nEastGroup sold the following operating properties during 2020: University Business Center 120 in Santa Barbara and Central Green in Houston. The properties (126,000 square feet combined) were sold for $21.0 million and the Company recognized gains on the sales of $13.1 million.\nIn 2019, EastGroup sold the following operating properties: World Houston 5 in Houston, Altamonte Commerce Center in Orlando, Southpointe Distribution Center in Tucson and three of its four University Business Center buildings in Santa Barbara, California. The properties (617,000 square feet combined) were sold for $68.5 million and the Company recognized gains on the sales of $41.1 million. The Company also sold (through eminent domain procedures) a small parcel of land (0.2 acres) adjacent to its Siempre Viva Distribution Center 1 in San Diego for $185,000 and the Company recognized a gain on the sale of $83,000.\nThe gains and losses on the sales of land are included in Other on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, and the gains and losses on the sales of operating properties are included in Gain on sales of real estate investments. See Notes 1(f) and 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to discontinued operations and gains and losses on sales of real estate investments.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nA discussion of changes in the Company's results of operations between 2019 and 2018 has been omitted from this Form 10-K and can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under 2019 Compared to 2018\u201d of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nEastGroup has evaluated all ASUs recently released by the FASB through the date the financial statements were issued and determined that the following ASUs apply to the Company.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and subsequently issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses in November 2018. The ASUs amend guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. For available for sale debt securities (EastGroup does not currently hold any and does not intend to hold any in the future), credit losses should be measured in a similar manner to current GAAP; however, Topic 326 requires that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than a write-down. The ASUs affect entities holding financial assets and are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU\n2016-13 and ASU 2018-19 on January 1, 2020, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The ASU is intended to improve the effectiveness of fair value measurement disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 on January 1, 2020, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASU 2020-04 contains practical expedients for reference rate reform related activities that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $196,285,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary other sources of cash were from borrowings on unsecured bank credit facilities; proceeds from unsecured debt; proceeds from common stock offerings; and net proceeds from sales of real estate investments. The Company distributed $119,765,000 in common stock dividends during 2020. Other primary uses of cash were for repayments on unsecured bank credit facilities, unsecured debt and secured debt; the construction and development of properties; purchases of real estate; and capital improvements at various properties.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is detailed below. The Company's unsecured bank credit facilities and unsecured debt instruments have certain restrictive covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage, and the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured bank credit facilities - variable rate, carrying amount </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,710 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(806) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,316) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured bank credit facilities </td> <td>124,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured debt - fixed rate, carrying amount (1)\n</td> <td>1,110,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>940,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(2,292) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,885) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured debt </td> <td>1,107,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>938,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured debt - fixed rate, carrying amount (1)\n</td> <td>79,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,422 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>(103) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(329) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured debt </td> <td>78,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,093 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,310,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,182,602 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)These loans have a fixed interest rate or an effectively fixed interest rate due to interest rate swaps.\nThe Company has a $350 million unsecured bank credit facility with a group of nine banks; the facility has a maturity date of July 30, 2022. The credit facility contains options for two six-month extensions (at the Company's election) and a $150 million accordion (with agreement by all parties). The interest rate on each tranche is usually reset on a monthly basis and as of\nDecember 31, 2020, was LIBOR plus 100 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points. The margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $125,000,000 of variable rate borrowings outstanding on this unsecured bank credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 1.152%. The Company has a standby letter of credit of $674,000 pledged on this facility.\nThe Company also has a $45 million unsecured bank credit facility with a maturity date of July 30, 2022, or such later date as designated by the bank; the Company also has two six-month extensions available if the extension options in the $350 million facility are exercised. The interest rate is reset on a daily basis and as of December 31, 2020, was LIBOR plus 100 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points. The margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate was 1.144% with no outstanding balance.\nAs market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace the short-term bank borrowings. The Company believes its current operating cash flow and unsecured bank credit facilities provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company. The Company also believes it can obtain debt financing and issue common and/or preferred equity. For future debt issuances, the Company intends to issue primarily unsecured fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital.\nIn March 2020, the Company closed a $100 million senior unsecured term loan with a seven-year term and interest only payments. It bears interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin (1.45% as of December 31, 2020) based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating. The Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the loan's LIBOR rate component to a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the loan providing a total effective fixed interest rate of 2.39%.\nIn July 2020, the Company and a group of lenders agreed to terms on the private placement of $175 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.65%. The $100 million note has a 10-year term and a fixed interest rate of 2.61%, and the $75 million note has a 12-year term and a fixed interest rate of 2.71%. These maturity dates complement the Company's existing debt maturity schedule. The notes dated August 17, 2020, were issued and sold on October 14, 2020 and require interest-only payments. The notes will not be and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.\nIn August 2020, the Company made a required $30 million principal repayment on $100 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.80%.\nIn October 2020, EastGroup repaid (with no penalty) a mortgage loan with a balance of $45.9 million, an interest rate of 4.39% and an original maturity date of January 5, 2021.\nIn December 2020, the Company repaid a $75 million unsecured term loan at maturity with an effectively fixed interest rate of 3.45%.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA\u201d) that regulates LIBOR announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ( ARRC\u201d) which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. In November 2020, the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE\u201d) Benchmark Administration Limited ( IBA\u201d), the administrator of LIBOR, announced that it would consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings immediately following December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023.\nThe Company is not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets. Any changes adopted by the FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. If that were to occur, our interest payments could change. In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form.\nThe Company's unsecured bank credit facilities, senior unsecured term loans and interest rate swap contracts are indexed to LIBOR. The Company is continuously monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest on loans and amounts received and paid on derivative instruments. These risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. The value of loans or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued as interest rates may be adversely affected. While we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified.\nEach of the Company's contracts, which are indexed to LIBOR, include provisions for a replacement rate which will be substantially equivalent to the all-in LIBOR-based interest rate in effect prior to its replacement. Therefore, the Company believes the transition will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 20, 2019, EastGroup entered into sales agreements with each of BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC; BofA Securities, Inc.; BTIG, LLC; Jefferies LLC; Raymond James & Associates, Inc.; Regions Securities LLC; and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC in connection with the establishment of a continuous common equity offering program pursuant to which the Company may sell shares of its common stock with an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750,000,000 from time to time in transactions that are deemed to be \"at the market\" offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or certain other transactions (the ATM Program\u201d). As of February 17, 2021, the Company sold an aggregate of 709,924 shares of common stock with gross proceeds of $93,938,000 under the ATM Program; therefore, under the ATM Program, EastGroup may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $656,062,000 through the sales agents.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, EastGroup issued and sold 709,924 shares of common stock under its ATM Program at an average price of $132.32 per share with gross proceeds to the Company of $93,938,000. The Company incurred offering-related costs of $1,275,000 during the year, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $92,663,000.\nContractual Obligations\nEastGroup's fixed, non-cancelable obligations as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Bank Credit Facilities (1) (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Unsecured Bank Credit Facilities (3)\n</td> <td>3,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Debt (1)\n</td> <td>1,110,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>665,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Unsecured Debt </td> <td>215,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,652 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Debt (1)\n</td> <td>79,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Secured Debt </td> <td>2,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends Payable (4)\n</td> <td>31,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office Leases </td> <td>1,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground Leases </td> <td>21,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,552 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Property Obligations (5)\n</td> <td>5,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Development and Value-Add Obligations (6)\n</td> <td>33,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant Improvements (7)\n</td> <td>12,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations </td> <td>33,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,676,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>415,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>748,986 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)These amounts are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of unamortized debt issuance costs.\n(2)The Company's balances under its unsecured bank credit facilities change depending on the Company's cash needs and, as such, both the principal amounts and the interest rates are subject to variability. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average interest rate was 1.152% on the $125,000,000 of variable rate debt that matures in July 2022. The $350 million unsecured credit facility has options for two six-month extensions (at the Company's election) and a $150 million accordion (with agreement by all parties). The $45 million unsecured credit facility automatically extends for two six-month terms if the extension options in the $350 million revolving facility are exercised. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate on the $350 million facility was LIBOR plus 100 basis points (weighted average interest rate of 1.152%) with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, and the interest rate on the $45 million facility, which resets on a daily basis, was LIBOR plus 100 basis points (1.144%) with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points. The margin and facility fee are subject to changes in the Company's credit ratings.\n(3)Represents an estimate of interest due on the Company's unsecured bank credit facilities based on the outstanding unsecured credit facilities as of December 31, 2020 and interest rates and maturity dates on the facilities as of December 31, 2020 as discussed in note 2 above.\n(4)Represents dividends declared during December 2020, which were paid in January 2021. Dividends Payable excludes dividends payable on unvested restricted stock of $1,433,000, which are subject to continued service and will be paid upon vesting in future periods.\n(5)Represents commitments on real estate properties, except for tenant improvement obligations.\n(6)Represents commitments on properties in the Company's development and value-add program, except for tenant improvement obligations.\n(7)Represents tenant improvement allowance obligations.\nThe Company anticipates that its current cash balance, operating cash flows, borrowings under its unsecured bank credit facilities, proceeds from new debt and/or proceeds from the issuance of equity instruments will be adequate for (i) operating and administrative expenses, (ii) normal repair and maintenance expenses at its properties, (iii) debt service obligations, (iv) maintaining compliance with its debt covenants, (v) distributions to stockholders, (vi) capital improvements, (vii) purchases of properties, (viii) development, and (ix) any other normal business activities of the Company, both in the short-term and long-term, including after taking into account the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nINFLATION AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS\nMost of the Company's leases include scheduled rent increases. Additionally, most of the Company's leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation or other factors. In the event\ninflation causes increases in the Company's general and administrative expenses or the level of interest rates, such increased costs would not be passed through to tenants and could adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nEastGroup's financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company's properties are located. The state of the economy, or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or general economic conditions, could result in the inability of some of the Company's existing tenants to make lease payments and may therefore increase the reserves for uncollectible rent. It may also impact the Company's ability to (i) renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire, or (ii) lease development space. In addition, an economic downturn or recession, including but not limited to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could also lead to an increase in overall vacancy rates or a decline in rents the Company can charge to re-lease properties upon expiration of current leases. In all of these cases, EastGroup's cash flows would be adversely affected.", "summary": "The report discusses EastGroup's operations and financial condition, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the pandemic, the company's operations, occupancy, and rent collections have remained stable. It received rent relief requests from approximately 28% of its customers, but only about 18% of these requests were granted. The company is focusing on monitoring the evolving COVID-19 situation and its impact on cash flows and operations.\n\nEastGroup's financial condition and balance sheet remain strong, with available capacity in its revolving credit facilities and compliance with debt covenants. The company continued construction on development and value-add projects, started construction on new projects, and acquired and sold properties in 2020.\n\nThe report provides detailed financial measurements, such as funds from operations (FFO) and property net operating income (PNOI), which are used to evaluate the company's financial performance.\n\nThe company's total assets increased, mainly driven by real estate property acquisitions and capital improvements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nEastGroup's goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider in its markets of functional, flexible and quality business distribution space for location-sensitive customers (primarily in the 15,000 to 70,000 square foot range). The Company develops, acquires and operates distribution facilities, the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply-constrained submarkets in major Sunbelt regions. The Company's core markets are in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Global, national and local economies continue to be impacted by the pandemic and the mitigation efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19.\nDuring the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant health, social and economic impacts from COVID-19. EastGroup's operations, occupancy and rent collections have remained substantially stable during this period. As of February 16, 2021, the Company has received rent relief requests, primarily in the form of payment deferral requests, from approximately 28% of its customers based on rental revenue. These requests have largely ended; for comparison, this is only a slight increase from 26% at the end of April 2020 during the beginning of the pandemic. To date, approximately 18% of these requests have been granted some form of relief, which represents approximately 5% of the Company's customers on a square foot basis. The Company has executed rent deferral agreements totaling $1.7 million, which represents approximately 0.4% of the Company's 2020 revenue. The deferrals all relate to 2020 rental income with no future period deferred rents. The terms differ for each deferral agreement, and all deferred rent payments that were due through December 31, 2020 have been collected with the exception of $27,000. As of February 16, 2021, 59% of total deferred rent has been collected. Under modified COVID-19-related guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), rental income for the majority of these deferral agreements ($1.4 million of the $1.7 million) qualifies to be recognized as rental income in the periods in which it was charged under the original terms of the leases. When requests were made, they were handled on a case-by-case basis, and the Company's responses were dependent on its understanding of the financial strength of the customer, the operational and earnings impacts being experienced by the customer, and the customer's ability or inability to obtain capital through debt or equity issuances, government assistance programs or by other means. As of February 16, 2021, rent payment deferrals representing approximately 0.4% of the Company's 2020 revenue have not been significant; the Company is continuing to actively monitor the evolving COVID-19 situation and its impact on the Company's cash flows and operations.\nAs of February 16, 2021, the Company's rent collection and rent payment deferral status was as follows:\n\n(1) Customer payments are received daily. The collection information presented is current through February 16, 2021, and the Company anticipates continuing to receive payments which will increase the % of Rent Collected.\n(2) Represents the period of February 1, 2021 through February 16, 2021 and assumes collections from government-related tenants. For comparison, as of February 16, 2021, February rental receipts are slightly higher than the January rental receipts were as of January 16, 2021.\nWe believe EastGroup's financial condition and balance sheet remain strong. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the Company's $395 million unsecured revolving credit facilities was $125 million, providing $270 million of available capacity. During 2020, EastGroup has only drawn amounts on its unsecured revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants at December 31, 2020 and anticipates remaining in compliance for the foreseeable future. The Company's recent debt and equity activity is further described under Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nThe Company has been continuing construction on already-active development and value-add projects. During the second and third quarters of 2020, EastGroup did not begin construction on any new development projects. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started construction on three new development projects. Management will continue to monitor the economic conditions of the Company's markets to determine whether to begin construction on additional future development projects.\nThe future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company are largely dependent on the severity and duration of the economic uncertainty and its effect on EastGroup's customers and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.\nGeneral\nThe Company believes its current operating cash flow and unsecured bank credit facilities provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company, and the Company also believes it can issue common and/or preferred equity and obtain debt financing. During 2020, EastGroup issued 709,924 shares of common stock through its continuous common equity offering program, providing net proceeds to the Company of $92.7 million. Also during 2020, the Company closed on a private placement of $175 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.65% and a $100 million senior unsecured term loan with an effective fixed interest rate of 2.39%. EastGroup's financing and equity issuances are further described in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nThe Company's primary revenue is rental income. During 2020, EastGroup executed leases on 8,118,000 square feet (18.5% of EastGroup's total square footage of 43,854,000 as of December 31, 2020). For new and renewal leases signed during 2020, average rental rates increased by 21.7% as compared to the former leases on the same spaces.\nProperty Net Operating Income ( PNOI\u201d) Excluding Income from Lease Terminations from same properties (defined as operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods - January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020), increased 2.1% for 2020 compared to 2019.\nEastGroup's portfolio was 98.0% leased at December 31, 2020 compared to 97.6% at December 31, 2019. As of February 16, 2021, the portfolio was 97.9% leased and 96.7% occupied. Leases scheduled to expire in 2021 were 14.9% of the portfolio on a square foot basis at December 31, 2020, and this percentage was reduced to 12.2% as of February 16, 2021.\nThe Company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its development and acquisition programs. The Company mitigates risks associated with development through a Board-approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity.\nDuring 2020, EastGroup acquired 509,000 square feet of operating and value-add properties in Atlanta, Dallas, Austin and Los Angeles and 232.6 acres of land in Orlando, Fort Myers, Atlanta, Dallas and El Paso for a total of $122.2 million. The Company began construction of 5 development projects containing 851,000 square feet in Miami, Fort Myers, Charlotte, Dallas and Phoenix. Also in 2020, the Company transferred 18 development and value-add properties (2,360,000 square feet) in Tampa, Miami, Orlando, Fort Myers, Charlotte, Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Las Vegas and San Diego from its development and value-add program to real estate properties with costs of $249.4 million at the date of transfer. As of December 31, 2020, EastGroup's development and value-add program consisted of 16 projects (2,741,000 square feet) located in 10 cities. The projected total cost for the development and value-add projects, which were collectively 35% leased as of February 16, 2021, is $291.5 million, of which $65.5 million remained to be invested as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2020, EastGroup sold 126,000 square feet of operating properties, generating gross sales proceeds of $21.0 million. The Company recognized $13.1 million in Gain on sales of real estate investments during 2020.\nThe Company typically initially funds its development and acquisition programs through its $395 million unsecured bank credit facilities (as discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources). As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace short-term bank borrowings. In June 2019, Moody's Investors Service affirmed the Company's issuer rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. For future debt issuances, the Company intends to issue primarily unsecured fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital.\nEastGroup has one reportable segment - industrial properties. The Company's properties, primarily located in major Sunbelt regions of the United States, have similar economic characteristics and as a result, have been aggregated into one reportable segment.\nThe Company's chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions: (1) funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ( FFO\u201d), and (2) property net operating income ( PNOI\u201d).\nFFO is computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( Nareit\u201d). In December 2018, Nareit issued the Nareit Funds from Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement\u201d (the 2018 White Paper\u201d), which reaffirmed, and in some cases refined, Nareit's prior determinations concerning FFO. The guidance in the 2018 White Paper allows preparers an option as it pertains to whether gains or losses on sale, or impairment charges, on real estate assets incidental to a REIT's business are excluded from the calculation of FFO. EastGroup has made the election to exclude activity related to such assets that are incidental to our business. In 2019, the Company revised prior periods to reflect this guidance.\nFFO is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate property (including other assets incidental to the Company's business) and impairment losses, adjusted for real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is not considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company's financial performance, nor is it a measure of the Company's liquidity or indicative of funds available to provide for the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. The Company's key drivers affecting FFO are changes in PNOI (as discussed below), interest rates, the amount of leverage the Company employs and general and administrative expenses.\nPNOI is defined as Income from real estate operations less Expenses from real estate operations (including market-based internal management fee expense) plus the Company's share of income and property operating expenses from its less-than-wholly-owned real estate investments.\nEastGroup sometimes refers to PNOI from Same Properties as Same PNOI\u201d; the Company also presents Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations. Same Properties is defined as operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period. Properties developed or acquired are excluded until held in the operating portfolio for both the current and prior year reporting periods. Properties sold during the current or prior year reporting periods are also excluded. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Same Properties includes properties which were included in the operating portfolio for the entire period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. The Company presents Same PNOI and Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations as a property-level supplemental measure of performance used to evaluate the performance of the Company's investments in real estate assets and its operating results on a same property basis. It is calculated on a lease-by-lease basis by averaging the customers' rent payments over the life of each individual lease.\nFFO and PNOI are supplemental industry reporting measurements used to evaluate the performance of the Company's investments in real estate assets and its operating results. The Company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry's calculations of PNOI and FFO provides supplemental indicators of the properties' performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. PNOI and FFO as calculated by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d). Investors should be aware that items excluded from or added back to FFO are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance.\nPNOI was calculated as follows for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nIncome from real estate operations is comprised of rental income net of reserves for uncollectible rent, expense reimbursement pass-through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees. Expenses from real estate operations is comprised of property taxes, insurance, utilities, repair and maintenance expenses, management fees and other operating costs. Generally, the Company's most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance. Tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable, modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable, or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable (gross leases represent only a small portion of the Company's total leases). Increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases. Modified gross leases often include base year amounts, and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable. The Company's exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of Net Income to PNOI, Same PNOI and Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n* Same property metrics are not applicable to the year ended December 31, 2018, as the same property metrics for 2020 and 2019 are based on operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020).\nThe following table presents reconciliations of Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc. Common Stockholders to FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n(1)The Company initially reported FFO of $4.67 per share during the year ended December 31, 2018. In connection with the Company's adoption of the Nareit Funds from Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, the Company now excludes from FFO the gains and losses on sales of non-operating real estate and assets incidental to the Company's business.\nThe Company analyzes the following performance trends in evaluating the revenues and expenses of the Company:\n\u2022The change in FFO per share represents the increase or decrease in FFO per share from the current year compared to the prior year. For 2020, FFO was $5.38 per share compared with $4.98 per share for 2019, an increase of 8.0%.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, PNOI increased by $21,792,000, or 9.1%, compared to 2019. PNOI increased $15,941,000 from newly developed and value-add properties, $5,505,000 from 2019 and 2020 acquisitions and $4,062,000 from same property operations; PNOI decreased $3,706,000 from operating properties sold in 2019 and 2020.\n\u2022The change in Same PNOI represents the PNOI increase or decrease for the same operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020). Same PNOI, excluding income from lease terminations, increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019.\n\u2022Same property average occupancy represents the average month-end percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage for the same operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020). Same property average occupancy was 97.0% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\u2022Occupancy is the percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage as of the close of the reporting period. Occupancy at December 31, 2020 was 97.3%. Quarter-end occupancy ranged from 96.4% to 97.1% over the previous four quarters ended December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020.\n\u2022Rental rate change represents the rental rate increase or decrease on new and renewal leases compared to the prior leases on the same space. For the year 2020, rental rate increases on new and renewal leases (18.5% of total square footage) averaged 21.7%.\n\u2022Lease termination fee income is included in Income from real estate operations. For the year 2020, lease termination fee income was $709,000 compared to $1,336,000 for 2019.\n\u2022The Company records reserves for uncollectible rent as reductions to Income from real estate operations. The Company recorded reserves for uncollectible rent of $2,763,000 in 2020 compared to $448,000 in 2019. Individual leases are evaluated for collectibility at each reporting period. We evaluate the collectibility of rents and other receivables at each reporting period based on factors including, among others, tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions and trends in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the geographic area where the property is located. If evaluation of these factors or others indicates it is not probable we will collect substantially all rent we recognize an adjustment to rental revenue. If our judgment or estimation regarding probability of collection changes we may adjust or record additional rental revenue in the period such conclusion is reached. The Company followed its normal process for recording reserves for uncollectible rent during the year ended December 31, 2020 and also evaluated all deferred rent related to the COVID-19 pandemic for collectibility.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company's management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the Company.\nAcquisition and Development of Real Estate Properties\nThe FASB Codification provides guidance on how to properly determine the allocation of the purchase price among the individual components of both the tangible and intangible assets based on their relative fair values. Goodwill for business combinations is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. The allocation to tangible assets (land, building and improvements) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models. Land is valued using comparable land sales specific to the applicable market, provided by a third-party. The Company determines whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar properties. The cost of the properties acquired may be adjusted based on indebtedness assumed from the seller that is determined to be above or below market rates.\nThe purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets: the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships. The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term, and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current market rents over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based upon management's assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable.\nThe relevance of this accounting policy will fluctuate given the transaction activity during the period.\nFor properties under development and value-add properties acquired in the development stage, costs associated with development (i.e., land, construction costs, interest expense, property taxes and other costs associated with development) are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property. Included in these costs are management's estimates for the portions of internal costs (primarily personnel costs) deemed related to such development activities. The internal costs are allocated to specific development projects based on development activity.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nEastGroup's Total Assets were $2,720,803,000 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $174,725,000 from December 31, 2019. Total Liabilities increased $106,536,000 to $1,450,285,000, and Total Equity increased $68,189,000 to $1,270,518,000 during the same period. The following paragraphs explain these changes in detail.\nAssets\nReal Estate Properties\nReal estate properties increased $314,930,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to: (i) the transfer of 18 properties from Development and value-add properties to Real estate properties (as detailed under Development and Value-Add Properties below); (ii) operating property acquisitions; and (iii) capital improvements at the Company's properties. These increases were partially offset by the operating property sales discussed below.\nDuring 2020, EastGroup acquired the following operating properties:\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nEastGroup's goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider in its markets of functional, flexible and quality business distribution space for location-sensitive customers (primarily in the 15,000 to 70,000 square foot range).

As of February 16, 2021, rent payment deferrals representing approximately 0.4% of the Company's 2020 revenue have not been significant; the Company is continuing to actively monitor the evolving COVID-19 situation and its impact on the Company's cash flows and operations.\nAs of February 16, 2021, the Company's rent collection and rent payment deferral status was as follows:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Rent Collected(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>% of Uncollected Rent Deferred to Future Period </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Uncollected Rent With No Deferral Agreement </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q1 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q2 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q3 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Q4 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>99.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 2021(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>95.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Customer payments are received daily. The collection information presented is current through February 16, 2021, and the Company anticipates continuing to receive payments which will increase the % of Rent Collected.\n(2) Represents the period of February 1, 2021 through February 16, 2021 and assumes collections from government-related tenants. For comparison, as of February 16, 2021, February rental receipts are slightly higher than the January rental receipts were as of January 16, 2021.\nWe believe EastGroup's financial condition and balance sheet remain strong. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the Company's $395 million unsecured revolving credit facilities was $125 million, providing $270 million of available capacity. During 2020, EastGroup has only drawn amounts on its unsecured revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants at December 31, 2020 and anticipates remaining in compliance for the foreseeable future. The Company's recent debt and equity activity is further described under Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nThe Company has been continuing construction on already-active development and value-add projects. During the second and third quarters of 2020, EastGroup did not begin construction on any new development projects. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started construction on three new development projects. Management will continue to monitor the economic conditions of the Company's markets to determine whether to begin construction on additional future development projects.\nThe future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company are largely dependent on the severity and duration of the economic uncertainty and its effect on EastGroup's customers and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.\nGeneral\nThe Company believes its current operating cash flow and unsecured bank credit facilities provide the capacity to fund the operations of the Company, and the Company also believes it can issue common and/or preferred equity and obtain debt financing. During 2020, EastGroup issued 709,924 shares of common stock through its continuous common equity offering program, providing net proceeds to the Company of $92.7 million. Also during 2020, the Company closed on a private placement of $175 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.65% and a $100 million senior unsecured term loan with an effective fixed interest rate of 2.39%. EastGroup's financing and equity issuances are further described in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nThe Company's primary revenue is rental income. During 2020, EastGroup executed leases on 8,118,000 square feet (18.5% of EastGroup's total square footage of 43,854,000 as of December 31, 2020). For new and renewal leases signed during 2020, average rental rates increased by 21.7% as compared to the former leases on the same spaces.\nProperty Net Operating Income ( PNOI\u201d) Excluding Income from Lease Terminations from same properties (defined as operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods - January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020), increased 2.1% for 2020 compared to 2019.\nEastGroup's portfolio was 98.0% leased at December 31, 2020 compared to 97.6% at December 31, 2019. As of February 16, 2021, the portfolio was 97.9% leased and 96.7% occupied. Leases scheduled to expire in 2021 were 14.9% of the portfolio on a square foot basis at December 31, 2020, and this percentage was reduced to 12.2% as of February 16, 2021.\nThe Company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its development and acquisition programs. The Company mitigates risks associated with development through a Board-approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity.\nDuring 2020, EastGroup acquired 509,000 square feet of operating and value-add properties in Atlanta, Dallas, Austin and Los Angeles and 232.6 acres of land in Orlando, Fort Myers, Atlanta, Dallas and El Paso for a total of $122.2 million. The Company began construction of 5 development projects containing 851,000 square feet in Miami, Fort Myers, Charlotte, Dallas and Phoenix. Also in 2020, the Company transferred 18 development and value-add properties (2,360,000 square feet) in Tampa, Miami, Orlando, Fort Myers, Charlotte, Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Las Vegas and San Diego from its development and value-add program to real estate properties with costs of $249.4 million at the date of transfer. As of December 31, 2020, EastGroup's development and value-add program consisted of 16 projects (2,741,000 square feet) located in 10 cities. The projected total cost for the development and value-add projects, which were collectively 35% leased as of February 16, 2021, is $291.5 million, of which $65.5 million remained to be invested as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2020, EastGroup sold 126,000 square feet of operating properties, generating gross sales proceeds of $21.0 million. The Company recognized $13.1 million in Gain on sales of real estate investments during 2020.\nThe Company typically initially funds its development and acquisition programs through its $395 million unsecured bank credit facilities (as discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources). As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace short-term bank borrowings. In June 2019, Moody's Investors Service affirmed the Company's issuer rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. For future debt issuances, the Company intends to issue primarily unsecured fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital.\nEastGroup has one reportable segment - industrial properties. The Company's properties, primarily located in major Sunbelt regions of the United States, have similar economic characteristics and as a result, have been aggregated into one reportable segment.\nThe Company's chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions: (1) funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ( FFO\u201d), and (2) property net operating income ( PNOI\u201d).\nFFO is computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( Nareit\u201d). In December 2018, Nareit issued the Nareit Funds from Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement\u201d (the 2018 White Paper\u201d), which reaffirmed, and in some cases refined, Nareit's prior determinations concerning FFO. The guidance in the 2018 White Paper allows preparers an option as it pertains to whether gains or losses on sale, or impairment charges, on real estate assets incidental to a REIT's business are excluded from the calculation of FFO. EastGroup has made the election to exclude activity related to such assets that are incidental to our business. In 2019, the Company revised prior periods to reflect this guidance.\nFFO is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate property (including other assets incidental to the Company's business) and impairment losses, adjusted for real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is not considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company's financial performance, nor is it a measure of the Company's liquidity or indicative of funds available to provide for the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. The Company's key drivers affecting FFO are changes in PNOI (as discussed below), interest rates, the amount of leverage the Company employs and general and administrative expenses.\nPNOI is defined as Income from real estate operations less Expenses from real estate operations (including market-based internal management fee expense) plus the Company's share of income and property operating expenses from its less-than-wholly-owned real estate investments.\nEastGroup sometimes refers to PNOI from Same Properties as Same PNOI\u201d; the Company also presents Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations. Same Properties is defined as operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period. Properties developed or acquired are excluded until held in the operating portfolio for both the current and prior year reporting periods. Properties sold during the current or prior year reporting periods are also excluded. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Same Properties includes properties which were included in the operating portfolio for the entire period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. The Company presents Same PNOI and Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations as a property-level supplemental measure of performance used to evaluate the performance of the Company's investments in real estate assets and its operating results on a same property basis. It is calculated on a lease-by-lease basis by averaging the customers' rent payments over the life of each individual lease.\nFFO and PNOI are supplemental industry reporting measurements used to evaluate the performance of the Company's investments in real estate assets and its operating results. The Company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry's calculations of PNOI and FFO provides supplemental indicators of the properties' performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. PNOI and FFO as calculated by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other real estate investment trusts ( REITs\u201d). Investors should be aware that items excluded from or added back to FFO are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance.\nPNOI was calculated as follows for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from real estate operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>362,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>330,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>299,018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses from real estate operations </td> <td>(103,368) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93,274) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86,394) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interest in PNOI of consolidated joint ventures </td> <td>(171) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(199) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(314) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNOI from 50% owned unconsolidated investment </td> <td>978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>869 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME ( PNOI\u201d) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>260,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>213,179 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome from real estate operations is comprised of rental income net of reserves for uncollectible rent, expense reimbursement pass-through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees. Expenses from real estate operations is comprised of property taxes, insurance, utilities, repair and maintenance expenses, management fees and other operating costs. Generally, the Company's most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance. Tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable, modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable, or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable (gross leases represent only a small portion of the Company's total leases). Increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases. Modified gross leases often include base year amounts, and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable. The Company's exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of Net Income to PNOI, Same PNOI and Same PNOI Excluding Income from Lease Terminations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET INCOME </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of real estate investments </td> <td>(13,145) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,068) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,273) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of non-operating real estate </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(83) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of other assets </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(427) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on other </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>497 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>(101) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(129) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(156) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>(354) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(574) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,374) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indirect leasing costs </td> <td>661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>116,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,704 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company's share of depreciation from unconsolidated investment </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>33,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,106 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>14,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interest in PNOI of consolidated joint ventures </td> <td>(171) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(199) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(314) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME ( PNOI\u201d) </td> <td>260,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>213,179 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNOI from 2019 and 2020 Acquisitions </td> <td>(8,434) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,929) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNOI from 2019 and 2020 Development and Value-Add Properties </td> <td>(24,050) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,109) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNOI from 2019 and 2020 Operating Property Dispositions </td> <td>(1,081) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,787) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other PNOI </td> <td>257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SAME PNOI </td> <td>226,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease termination fee income from same properties </td> <td>(709) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,258) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SAME PNOI EXCLUDING INCOME FROM LEASE TERMINATIONS </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Same property metrics are not applicable to the year ended December 31, 2018, as the same property metrics for 2020 and 2019 are based on operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020).\nThe following table presents reconciliations of Net Income Attributable to EastGroup Properties, Inc.

In connection with the Company's adoption of the Nareit Funds from Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, the Company now excludes from FFO the gains and losses on sales of non-operating real estate and assets incidental to the Company's business.\nThe Company analyzes the following performance trends in evaluating the revenues and expenses of the Company:\n\u2022The change in FFO per share represents the increase or decrease in FFO per share from the current year compared to the prior year. For 2020, FFO was $5.38 per share compared with $4.98 per share for 2019, an increase of 8.0%.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2020, PNOI increased by $21,792,000, or 9.1%, compared to 2019. PNOI increased $15,941,000 from newly developed and value-add properties, $5,505,000 from 2019 and 2020 acquisitions and $4,062,000 from same property operations; PNOI decreased $3,706,000 from operating properties sold in 2019 and 2020.\n\u2022The change in Same PNOI represents the PNOI increase or decrease for the same operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020). Same PNOI, excluding income from lease terminations, increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019.\n\u2022Same property average occupancy represents the average month-end percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage for the same operating properties owned during the entire current and prior year reporting periods (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020). Same property average occupancy was 97.0% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\u2022Occupancy is the percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage as of the close of the reporting period. Occupancy at December 31, 2020 was 97.3%. Quarter-end occupancy ranged from 96.4% to 97.1% over the previous four quarters ended December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020.\n\u2022Rental rate change represents the rental rate increase or decrease on new and renewal leases compared to the prior leases on the same space. For the year 2020, rental rate increases on new and renewal leases (18.5% of total square footage) averaged 21.7%.\n\u2022Lease termination fee income is included in Income from real estate operations. For the year 2020, lease termination fee income was $709,000 compared to $1,336,000 for 2019.\n\u2022The Company records reserves for uncollectible rent as reductions to Income from real estate operations. The Company recorded reserves for uncollectible rent of $2,763,000 in 2020 compared to $448,000 in 2019. Individual leases are evaluated for collectibility at each reporting period. We evaluate the collectibility of rents and other receivables at each reporting period based on factors including, among others, tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions and trends in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the geographic area where the property is located. If evaluation of these factors or others indicates it is not probable we will collect substantially all rent we recognize an adjustment to rental revenue. If our judgment or estimation regarding probability of collection changes we may adjust or record additional rental revenue in the period such conclusion is reached. The Company followed its normal process for recording reserves for uncollectible rent during the year ended December 31, 2020 and also evaluated all deferred rent related to the COVID-19 pandemic for collectibility.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company's management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the Company.\nAcquisition and Development of Real Estate Properties\nThe FASB Codification provides guidance on how to properly determine the allocation of the purchase price among the individual components of both the tangible and intangible assets based on their relative fair values. Goodwill for business combinations is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. The allocation to tangible assets (land, building and improvements) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models. Land is valued using comparable land sales specific to the applicable market, provided by a third-party. The Company determines whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar properties. The cost of the properties acquired may be adjusted based on indebtedness assumed from the seller that is determined to be above or below market rates.\nThe purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets: the above or below market component of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships. The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term, and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current market rents over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based upon management's assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable.\nThe relevance of this accounting policy will fluctuate given the transaction activity during the period.\nFor properties under development and value-add properties acquired in the development stage, costs associated with development (i.e., land, construction costs, interest expense, property taxes and other costs associated with development) are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property. Included in these costs are management's estimates for the portions of internal costs (primarily personnel costs) deemed related to such development activities. The internal costs are allocated to specific development projects based on development activity.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nEastGroup's Total Assets were $2,720,803,000 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $174,725,000 from December 31, 2019.
