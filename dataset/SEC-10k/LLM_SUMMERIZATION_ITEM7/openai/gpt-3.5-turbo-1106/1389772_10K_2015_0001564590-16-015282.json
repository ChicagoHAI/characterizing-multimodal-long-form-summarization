Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion summarizes First Priority's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and its financial condition as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and highlights material changes. This discussion is intended to provide additional information about the significant changes in the results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, contained in this document, for First Priority and its wholly owned subsidiary, First Priority Bank. First Priority's consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist essentially of First Priority Bank's financial condition and results of operations. Current performance does not guarantee, and may not be indicative of, similar performance in the future. This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as First Priority's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.\nReaders should note that many factors, some of which are discussed elsewhere in this report, could affect the future financial results of First Priority and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this document.\nOverview\nThe following table sets forth selected measures of First Priority's financial position or performance for the dates or periods indicated (dollars in thousands).\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, and for the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue (1)................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income..........................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets.........................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 546,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 492,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 446,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 275,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 285,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans receivable.......\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 409,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 375,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 335,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 244,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 240,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits.....................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 408,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 378,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 357,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 233,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 245,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Total revenue equals net interest income plus non-interest income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Net income in 2014 includes a tax benefit of $4.50 million resulting from the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLike most financial institutions, First Priority derives the majority of its income from interest it receives on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments. First Priority's primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is its deposits, on which it pays interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of First Priority's success is its amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on its average interest-earning assets and the expense on its average interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the spread between the yield First Priority earns on these average interest-earning assets and the rate it pays on its average interest-bearing liabilities, which is called its net interest spread.\nThere are risks inherent in all loans, and First Priority maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb potential losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. This allowance is maintained by charging a provision for loan losses against operating earnings. A detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing the allowance for loan losses is included herein.\nIn addition to earning interest on its loans and investments, First Priority earns income through other sources, such as fees and other charges to its banking customers and income from providing wealth management services, as well as net gains or losses realized from the sale of assets. The various components of non-interest income, as well as non-interest expense, are described in this section.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nFirst Priority has adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that are consistent with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. First Priority's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by First Priority that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. First Priority considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting estimates. The judgment and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors, which First Priority believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and have been reasonably consistent with prior results. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made, actual results could differ from these estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of its assets and liabilities and its results of operations. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to investment securities impairment evaluation, the valuation of acquired loans, the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of other real estate owned, the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill, the valuation of deferred tax assets and accounting for stock-based compensation.\nInvestment Securities Impairment Evaluation. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. When a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists but the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the debt security prior to its anticipated recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit loss) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. Management believes that there are no investment securities with other-than-temporary impairment for each of the reporting periods presented.\nAcquired Loans. Fair values for acquired loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant assumptions and judgments as to estimate of credit risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values and discount rate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans.\nPools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates in each category of loans and adjusted for qualitative factors. Management assigned each factor a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on its best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nAn unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.\nImpairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nSee the Allowance for Loan Losses sections related to Balance Sheet Review as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 for more information.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Any write-down, at or prior to the dates the real estate is considered foreclosed, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets ( DTA\u201d) are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.\nTemporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with the Bank.\nIf management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.\nWhen determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance, the Company assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards, as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 740-10-30-18. This guidance related to when a valuation allowance on the DTA should be maintained, generally provides that the valuation allowance should be reversed, when in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that the DTA will be realized. Management has determined that the DTA will be realized and does not maintain a valuation allowance.\nStock Based Compensation. Compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions are recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on management's assumptions. Therefore value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the estimated fair value of the shares at the date of the award.\nResults of Operations\nIncome Statement Review\nFirst Priority's results of operations are affected by five major elements: (1) net interest income, or the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense accrued on deposits and borrowed funds; (2) the provision for loan losses, or the amount added to the allowance for loan losses to provide reserves for inherent losses on loans; (3) non-interest income, consisting of income from wealth management services, fees and other charges to our banking customers, and net gains or losses realized from the sale of assets; (4) non-interest expense, which consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and other operating expenses; and (5) income taxes, including deferred taxes, when applicable. Each of these major elements is reviewed in more detail in the following discussion.\nResults of Operations Comparative Summary\nShown in the table below are the reported results of operations as well as the increase (decrease) for the respective periods.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (decrease)\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income..................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 16,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 15,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 410\n</td> <td> 2.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenue....................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses........................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (522)\n</td> <td> (46.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expenses............................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax (benefit) expense .................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal income tax (benefit) expense ...................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,502)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income .........................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 6,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (4,813)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred dividends, including net warrant amortization...\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income to common shareholders.............................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 6,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (5,035)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic....................................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted.................................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSummary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, First Priority's consolidated income before income taxes increased 26% to $3.05 million compared to $2.42 million for the same period of 2014. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $2.11 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted common share after preferred dividends totaling $801 thousand. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, including a tax benefit totaling $4.50 million totaled $6.93 million, or $0.98 per basic and diluted common share after preferred dividends totaling $579 thousand paid during the period. During the third quarter of 2014, the Company reversed the valuation allowance related to its net deferred tax asset and, accordingly, recognized a tax benefit in that quarter of $4.71 million.\nNet Interest Income\nFirst Priority's primary source of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is determined by the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned and paid on these balances. The amount of net interest income recorded by First Priority is affected by the rate, mix and amount of growth of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amount of interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities, and by changes in interest rates earned and interest rates paid on these assets and liabilities.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, information related to First Priority's average balances, yields on average assets, and costs of average liabilities. Average balances are derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated and yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. Average loans are stated net of deferred costs. The net dollar amounts and percentage changes of interest income and expense are presented for comparative purposes.\nAnalysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

income increased 2.60%, or $410 thousand, to $16.19 million compared to $15.78 million for the same period in 2014. Net interest margin declined 20 basis points from 3.70% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3.50% for the same period in 2015. Net interest spread, defined as the mathematical difference between the yield on average earning assets and the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities, declined 20 basis points from 3.55% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3.35% for the same period in 2015. When comparing these periods, incremental growth of balances accounted for an increase of $1.17 million while the change in our relative rate structure resulted in a decline in net interest income of $760 thousand.\nAverage interest earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $35.3 million, or 8.3%, including increases in average loans of $32.3 million, or 9.1%, and average investment balances of $5.3 million, or 8.1%, when compared to the prior year. This increased volume of average earning assets provided an additional $1.68 million in interest income, $1.49 million provided from incremental loan balances and $194 thousand from investment securities, including deposits with banks. The average yield on earning assets declined 15 basis points in the current year compared to the prior year from 4.37% to 4.22%, which resulted in a decline of interest income between the periods of $817 thousand. Of this decline, $916 thousand was related to lower yields on loans partially offset by a net increase of $99 thousand related to investment securities, deposits with other banks and other investment income, including an increase of $72 thousand related to dividends paid on FHLB restricted stock outstanding during the period.\nAverage interest bearing liabilities increased $32.6 million, or 9.3%, in 2015. During this time, overall deposit balances increased $28.9 million, as time deposits grew $40.8 million, while interest bearing demand deposits decreased $6.9 million and money market and savings deposits decreased $5.0 million. At the same time, borrowed funds increased $3.7 million. The incremental growth of interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase of interest expense of $510 thousand. Additionally, the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased 5 basis points from 0.82% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 0.87% in the current year; however, due to the changing mix among products, interest expense related to average rates on interest bearing liabilities declined by $57 thousand when comparing the two years.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, First Priority's balance sheet was moderately liability sensitive, which suggests that First Priority would experience moderate net interest margin compression in a rising interest rate environment.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged against operations. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance as recoveries.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on known or potential risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, the composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.\nAt the end of each quarter or more often, if necessary, First Priority analyzes the collectability of its loans and accordingly adjusts the loan loss allowance to an appropriate level. The allowance for loan losses covers estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans that are determined to be impaired, as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio. For a description of the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, see the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section below.\nThe provision for loan losses was $610 thousand in 2015 compared to $1.13 million for 2014. The level of provision is impacted by the adequacy of the allowance as described above, including an analysis of impaired and non-performing loans, as well as by the level of incremental loan volume and net charge-offs of loans. Total loans increased $33.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and $39.5 million during 2014. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, totaled $128 thousand and $1.09 million, respectively. 2014 included a charge-off of $513 thousand related to a non-performing commercial line of credit, resulting from an updated appraisal value indicating a shortfall in the collateral position. The allowance for loan losses was $2.8 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which represented 0.68% and 0.62% of total loans outstanding at each respective date.\nAcquired loans are initially recorded at acquisition date at their acquisition date fair values, and therefore, are excluded from the calculation of loan loss reserves as of the acquisition date. As acquired loans are paid off or are refinanced or\nextended under First Priority's credit underwriting process, they are no longer considered acquired loans, but instead are prospectively considered originated loans and therefore, are included as part of the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. To the extent there is a decrease in the present value of cash flows from acquired impaired loans after the date of acquisition, the Company records a provision for loan losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $230 thousand related to acquired loans, of which $127 thousand related to net charge-offs on non-credit impaired purchased loans while charge-offs related to acquired loans which were initially considered credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date were $73 thousand. As of December 31, 2015, there was $30 thousand specifically designated within the Company's allowance for loan losses related to acquired loans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $425 thousand related to acquired loans. There were charge-offs recorded during 2014 totaling $250 thousand related to loans that were initially considered credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date while net charge-offs on non-credit impaired purchased loans totaled $175 thousand during 2014. As of December 31, 2014, there were no loans for which any portion of the Company's allowance for loan losses was specifically designated to acquired loans\nNon-Interest Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, non-interest income totaled $1.16 million compared to $1.01 million for the same period in 2014, an increase of $148 thousand, or 14.7%. Non-interest income is comprised of wealth management fees which are principally non-recurring commissions and fees related to the sale of insurance products and annuities, service charges on deposit accounts, income resulting from the investment in bank owned life insurance, gain (losses) from the sale of investment securities, and other fees which First Priority Bank collects from its banking customers. In the current year, there were $259 thousand in gains from the sale of investment securities available for sale while gains of $51 thousand were realized in 2014.\nComponents of non-interest income are shown in the table below:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wealth management fee income..............\n</td> <td> $ 441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (72)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.0)\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposits....................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other branch fees....................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan related fees.....................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on sales of investment securities..\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 407.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bank owned life insurance income..........\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other.......................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39.1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Non-Interest Income.....................\n</td> <td> $ 1,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 1,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Interest Expenses\nNon-interest expenses were $13.68 million in 2015 compared to $13.23 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $456 thousand, or 3.4%.

The Company recognized a tax benefit in the Statement of Operations of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of reversing the valuation allowance on the Company's net deferred tax asset ( DTA\u201d) during the third quarter of 2014, which established the net DTA position on the balance sheet of the Company. Subsequent to the reversal of the valuation allowance, the Company records current tax expense in its Statement of Operations and reports earnings of the Company to its shareholders and regulators on an after tax basis. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 30.7% which approximates the expected tax rate going forward.\nThe Company's net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards totaled $7.9 million as of December 31, 2015, including acquired NOLs.

total assets of $492.3 million at December 31, 2014. Total assets at December 31, 2015 consisted principally of earning assets which includes loans outstanding of $409.2 million, investment securities of $114.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 million. At December 31, 2014, earning assets consisted of loans outstanding of $375.2 million, investment securities of $91.5 million and cash and cash equivalents of $7.9 million.\nDeposits totaled $408.7 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $378.2 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $30.5 million, or 8.1%. During 2015, increases in brokered time deposits of $38.7 million, retail time deposits of $1.6 million and NOW accounts of $4.1 million were offset by declines of $3.1 million in non-interest bearing demand accounts and $10.8 million in money market and savings deposit accounts.\nBorrowings totaled $83.9 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $62.5 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $21.5 million, or 34.3%. During the fourth quarter of 2015, First Priority Bank issued $9.5 million of ten year Tier 2 qualifying subordinated term notes, or $9.2 million net of issuance costs. In addition, short-term borrowings increased $8.2 million and long-term FHLB borrowings increased $4.0 million.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $52.1 million, representing an increase of $1.9 million from $50.2 million at December 31, 2014. The enhanced capital position is attributable to net income of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, market volatility related to the investment securities portfolio resulting in a net unrealized gain position totaling $242 thousand and the reclassification of stock compensation expense of $327 thousand. These increases were partially offset by preferred dividends declared of $801 thousand.\nInvestments\nFirst Priority's total investment portfolio was $114.6 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $91.5 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $23.1 million, or 25.2%. As of both December 31, 2015 and 2014, the investment portfolio included $50 million and $30 million of short-term investments, respectively, consisting of United States Treasury securities or Federal Home Loan Bank notes, which were purchased related to year-end tax planning strategies and subsequently matured in January of each respective following year.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, the Company purchased $10 million of ten year U.S. Treasury securities that were subsequently sold in the second half of the year due to favorable market conditions, which resulted in gains from sale of investments totaling $172 thousand. An additional $15 million of investments, primarily state and municipal bonds were purchased during 2015. Also, during 2015, three municipal bonds were sold totaling $1.5 million, which resulted in additional investment gains of $87 thousand, while maturities and other called securities totaled approximately $8 million during the year.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, investments totaling $94.7 million and $75.6 million, respectively, were classified as available for sale while $19.9 million and $16.0 million, respectively, were classified as held to maturity. Total investments accounted for 21.0% and 18.6% of total assets at each respective date.\nThe Company previously transferred investment securities from available for sale to held to maturity securities. Due to these transfers securities classified as held to maturity have net unrealized holding gains, totaling $43 thousand as of December 31, 2015, which are being amortized over the remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the accretion of discount on debt securities. This will have no impact on the Company's net income because the amortization of the unrealized holding gains reported in equity will offset the effect on interest income of the accretion of the discount on these securities. The transfer of securities from available for sale to held to maturity was completed in order to mitigate the volatility to common equity caused by sudden market fluctuations and to lock in a predictable earnings on these related securities.\nSecurities classified as available for sale are accounted for at fair value, with the difference between fair value and amortized cost reflected in the capital account as other comprehensive income or loss. The Company had net unrealized gains on available for sale securities totaling $315 thousand at December 31, 2015 compared to unrealized losses of $86 thousand at December 31, 2014. Available for sale securities are securities that management intends to hold for an indefinite period of time or securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment expectations, capital management and liquidity needs.\nThe total investment portfolio at December 31, 2015 was comprised of federal agency securities (54%), federal agency mortgage backed securities and federal agency collateralized mortgage obligations (15%), obligations of states and political subdivisions (30%), and corporate and other debt securities (1%). All investment securities were either government guaranteed, issued by a government agency or investment grade. First Priority had no investment securities deemed to have other than temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) at December 31, 2015 or 2014, respectively, and recorded no OTTI charges during either of the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nThe following table sets forth information about the contractual maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities at December 31, 2015. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to scheduled principal payments and unscheduled prepayments of mortgage backed securities and, where applicable, the ability of an issuer to call a security prior to the contractual maturity date.\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Securities Available for Sale\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2015\n</td>

stocks\nRestricted investments in bank stocks represent the investment in the common stock of correspondent banks required in order to transact business with those banks. Investments in restricted stock are carried at cost.\nAt both December 31, 2015 and 2014, First Priority Bank held $110 thousand in common stock of Atlantic Community Bankers Bank, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. Additionally, First Priority had investments in the common stock of the FHLB Bank of Pittsburgh totaling $3.26 million and $2.87 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in investments is attributable to the incremental investment required to support increased borrowings.\nLoans\nFirst Priority's loan portfolio is the primary component of its assets. At December 31, 2015, total loans were $409.2 million, representing an increase of $34.0 million, or 9.1%, from total loans outstanding of $375.2 million at December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, loan growth included new organic loan production of approximately $68 million while loan payoffs combined with normal principal payments totaled $44 million. Also included in the current year loan growth is $9.8 million from the purchase of performing residential real estate loans located in western Pennsylvania which were underwritten using similar underwriting standards as the Bank uses for its organic portfolio.

multifamily residential properties, or 1-4 family residential properties. As of December 31, 2015, commercial mortgage loans totaled $179.4 million, consisting of $121.3 million of loans to finance commercial business properties of which 60% are owner occupied; $17.3 million to finance and are secured by multifamily properties; $36.2 million secured by 1-4 family residential dwelling properties for business purposes; and $4.6 million for other purposes. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, loans to lessors of non-residential buildings totaled $74.1 million, which is included in commercial mortgage loans; of this amount, $35.4 million, or 48% of these loans are related to owner occupied buildings.\nAs of December 31, 2014, total commercial mortgage loans of $169.0 million, consisting of $115.8 million of loans to finance commercial business properties, of which 60% are owner occupied, $15.4 million to finance, and are secured by, multifamily properties, $31.4 million secured by 1-4 family residential dwelling properties for business purposes, and $6.4 million for other purposes. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, loans to lessors of non-residential buildings totaled $69.5 million, which is included in commercial mortgage loans; of this amount, $33.7 million, or 48% of these loans are related to owner occupied buildings.\nThe payment experience of certain non-owner occupied commercial mortgage loans may be dependent upon the successful operation of the real estate project. These risks can be significantly affected by supply and demand conditions in the market for office and retail space and for apartments and, as such, may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. In dealing with these risk factors, First Priority generally limits itself to a real estate market or to borrowers with which First Priority has experience. First Priority generally concentrates on originating commercial real estate loans secured by properties located within its market area and many of First Priority's commercial real estate loans are secured by owner-occupied property with personal guarantees of the debt.\nRegulatory guidance exists whereby total construction, land development and other land loans should not exceed 100% of total risk-based capital and further guidance whereby total construction, land development and other land loans combined with real estate loans secured by multifamily or nonresidential properties and loans to finance commercial real estate or construction loans (not secured by real estate) should not exceed 300% of total risk-based capital. First Priority Bank monitors these two ratios, which as of December 31, 2015, totaled 36% and 182% of total risk-based capital, respectively, both well within the regulatory suggested guidance.\nThe information in the following tables is based on the contractual maturities of individual loans, including loans that may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms upon their maturity. Actual repayments of loans may differ from the maturities reflected below because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.\nThe following tables summarize

This decrease consisted of payments or payoffs totaling $1.7 million on existing non-performing loans, two loans totaling $224 thousand which were restored to performing based on improving financial positions of the borrowers, another loan of $70 thousand, previously reported as past due 90 days or more, which was paid current, and two non-performing loans totaling $35 thousand that were charged-off during this period. Six loan relationships with balances totaling $776 thousand were transferred to other real estate owned. Additionally, there were four new non-performing loans identified in 2015 totaling $280 thousand. Total non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2015 was 0.47%, down from 1.21% at December 31, 2014. Other real estate owned totaled $1.6 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.3 million at December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015 there were no repossessed assets. Repossessed assets totaled $42 thousand at December 31, 2014.

Troubled debt restructurings may be deemed to have a higher risk of loss than loans which have not been restructured. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, First Priority's performing troubled debt restructurings totaled $2.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nFirst Priority Bank's management continues to monitor and explore potential options and remedial actions to recover First Priority Bank's investment in non-performing loans. According to policy, First Priority Bank is required to maintain a specific reserve for impaired loans. See the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section below for further information.\nFirst Priority Bank's total delinquency amount is comprised of loans past due 30 to 89 days and still accruing plus the balance of non-performing loans. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, loans past due 30 to 89 days and still accruing totaled $1.0 million and $986 thousand, respectively, which when added to the non-performing loans for each period, resulted in a total delinquency ratio of 0.73% and 1.48%, respectively, of total loans outstanding.\nAllowance for loan losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents an amount that First Priority believes will be adequate to absorb estimated credit losses on loans that may become impaired. While First Priority applies the methodology discussed below in connection with the establishment of the allowance for loan losses, the allowance is subject to critical judgments on the part of management. Risks within the loan portfolio are analyzed on a continuous basis by the management of First Priority Bank, periodically analyzed by an external independent loan review function, and are also reviewed by the audit committee. A risk system, consisting of multiple grading categories, is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and appropriate allowances. In addition to the risk system, management further evaluates the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower, past and expected loss experience, and other factors which management believes deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate allowance. These estimates are reviewed at least quarterly, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are realized in the periods in which they become known.\nFirst Priority uses a quantitative and qualitative method to allocating its allowance to the various loan categories. An unallocated component, which is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of potential losses, reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. Additions to the allowance are made by provisions charged to expense, and the allowance is reduced by net charge-offs, which are loans judged to be uncollectible, less any recoveries on loans previously charged off. Although management attempts to maintain the allowance at an adequate level, future additions to the allowance may be required due to the growth of the loan portfolio, changes in asset quality, changes in market conditions and other factors. Additionally, various regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require additional provisions based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Although management uses what it believes to be the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended\n</td>

represented 0.68% and 0.62% of total loans outstanding at each respective date. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the unamortized portion of the general credit fair value adjustment totaled $174 thousand and $509 thousand, respectively, and the specific credit market valuation adjustment totaled $362 thousand and $443 thousand as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 the combination of these remaining credit fair value adjustments related to acquired loans, totaling $536 thousand and $952 thousand, respectively, and the allowance for loan losses of $2.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively, or a total of $3.3 million for both periods, would equate to 0.81% and 0.87% of total loans outstanding as of each respective period. Net charge-offs recorded totaled $128 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2014.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category. The specific allocations in any particular category may be reallocated in the future to reflect the then current conditions. Accordingly, management considers the entire allowance to be available to absorb losses in any category.\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of total loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of total loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of total loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of total loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent of total loans (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands except percentage data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and Industrial\n</td> <td> $ 631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 1,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential Mortgage Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Home Equity Lines of Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Consumer Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Allocated\n</td> <td> 2,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td> $ 2,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents loans outstanding in each category, as of the date shown, as a percentage of total loans outstanding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for loans that are classified as impaired or are performing troubled debt restructurings when the discounted cash flows or related collateral value of each loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. A specific allocation of $452 thousand has been provided on impaired loans of $4.6 million at December 31, 2015 compared to a specific allocation of $166 thousand related to $6.6 million of impaired loans at December 31, 2014.\nThe general allocation component of the allowance for loan losses relates to reserves established for pools of homogenous loans which includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis utilizes a risk matrix that incorporates qualitative and environmental factors such as: loan volume, management, loan review process, internal policies and procedures, economic environment, credit concentrations, credit quality trends, and regulatory and other external factors. These factors are each risk rated using five levels from weak to strong which could create a total qualitative factor of up to 42 basis points of gross loans, depending on individual ratings applied. The quantitative analysis uses a historical four year rolling average loan loss experience factor which management believes is a sufficient period to properly represent swings resulting from changing economic cycles, and therefore, reflects an appropriate period of loss history for calculating the general reserve in the current environment.\nThe cumulative results from the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the loan portfolio resulted in a general allocation portion of the allowance for loan losses totaling $1.6 million as of both December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. When comparing these periods, the inherent increase resulting from a higher level of outstanding loans was offset by a decline due to lower historical loss factors. This decline in loss factors, when comparing each period's trailing four year historical losses, resulted from relative lower losses incurred in the 2015 compared to higher losses incurred during the financial crisis in 2011, the initial year used to determine the 2014 loss factors.\nAn unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect Management's estimate of probable loss. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.\nThese allocations could change based on general economic or environmental factors or due to a specific credit situation which could develop within the loan portfolio. However, based on all relevant information currently available as of December 31, 2015, management believes that the allowance for loan losses of $2.8 million is adequate as of that date and the allocations described above are appropriate.\nLoan Concentrations\nThe Company's loans consist of credits to borrowers spread over a broad range of industrial classifications. The largest concentrations of loans are to lessors of nonresidential buildings and lessors of residential buildings and dwellings. As of December 31, 2015, these loans totaled $74.1 million and $58.4 million, respectively, or 18.1% and 14.3%, respectively, of\nthe total loans outstanding. As of December 31, 2014, these same classifications of loans totaled $69.5 million and $54.7 million, respectively, or 18.5% and 14.6%, respectively, of the total loans outstanding. These credits were subject to normal underwriting standards and did not present more than the normal amount of risk assumed by the Company's other lending activities. Management believes this concentration does not pose abnormal risk when compared to the risk it assumes in other types of lending. The Company has no other concentration of loans which exceeds 10% of total loans.\nDeposits\nDeposits represent the primary source of funding for earning assets. Deposits totaled $408.7 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $378.2 million at December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $30.5 million, or 8.1%. During 2015, increases in brokered time deposits of $38.7 million, retail time deposits of $1.6 million and NOW accounts of $4.1 million were offset by declines of $3.1 million in non-interest bearing demand accounts and $10.8 million in money market and savings deposit accounts.\nFirst Priority attracts deposits by offering competitive products and interest rates on a broad spectrum of deposit products to customers in its local marketplace, generally through its retail branch system, and also through its internet banking platform. First Priority Bank supplements deposits raised locally with the issuance of brokered deposits when cost effective relative to local market pricing. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, brokered deposits totaled $113.3 million and $74.6 million, respectively. The guidelines governing First Priority Bank's participation in the brokered CD market are included in First Priority Bank's Asset Liability Management Policy, which is reviewed, revised and approved annually by the asset liability management committee and the board of directors. The FDIC places restrictions on a depository institution's use of brokered deposits based on the bank's capital classification. A well-capitalized institution may accept brokered deposits without FDIC restrictions. An adequately capitalized institution must obtain a waiver from the FDIC in order to accept brokered deposits, while an undercapitalized institution is prohibited by the FDIC from accepting brokered deposits. First Priority Bank is classified as well-capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions (see Regulatory Matters\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and, therefore, may accept brokered deposits without FDIC restrictions.\nThe following table sets forth the average balance of First Priority's deposits and the average rates paid on deposits for the three years ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Average Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand, non-interest bearing..............\n</td> <td> $ 47,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 48,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 37,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand, interest-bearing......................\n</td> <td> 32,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.27%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market and savings deposits..\n</td> <td> 95,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.33%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.33%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.39%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits.........................................\n</td> <td> 206,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.26%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 165,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.36%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.63%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest-bearing deposits............\n</td> <td> 334,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 305,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.88%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 292,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.02%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits.........................................\n</td> <td> $ 382,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 353,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 329,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe maturity distribution of time deposits of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2015, is as follows:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Three Months or Less..............................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 3,977\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over Three Through Six Months............\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,921\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over Six Through Twelve Months.........\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,783\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over Twelve Months................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,457\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL........................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 56,138\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-Term Borrowed Funds\nAt December 31, 2015, First Priority had short-term borrowings totaling $59.7 million, compared to $51.5 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term borrowings consisted of advances from the FHLB as of each of these periods. The increase in short-term borrowings resulted primarily from net funding requirements of growth in earning assets in conjunction with slower growth in deposit balances. Advances from the FHLB at December 31, 2015 are collateralized by an investment in the common stock of the FHLB, by a specific pledge of First Priority Bank's investment assets and by a blanket lien on qualifying mortgages within First Priority Bank's loan portfolio.\nThe following table outlines First Priority's various sources of short-term borrowed funds at or for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The maximum balance represents the highest indebtedness for each category of short-term borrowed funds at any month-end during each of the periods shown.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal funds purchased:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at year end........................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate at year end.............\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum month-end balance......................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily balance during the year.......\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate during the year......\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.51\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.51\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB short-term borrowings:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance at year end........................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate at year end.............\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.45\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum month-end balance......................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average daily balance during the year.......\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate during the year......\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt\nLong term debt totaled $15.0 million as of December 31, 2015 and $11.0 million as of December 31, 2014. These borrowings consisted of advances from the FHLB with a weighted average interest rate of 1.09% and 0.88%, respectively, as of each of these dates and an average remaining life of 1.9 years and 2.2 years for each respective period. Advances from the FHLB are collateralized by an investment in the common stock of the FHLB, by a specific pledge of First Priority Bank's investment assets and by a blanket lien on qualifying mortgages within First Priority Bank's loan portfolio. Balances of FHLB long-term debt averaged $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $11.0 million during the same period in 2014 with an average rate of 1.00% in 2015 and 0.89% for the same period in 2014. The maximum month end balance of these borrowings was $16.0 million and $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSubordinated Debt\nOn November 13, 2015, First Priority Bank entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements with five accredited investors under which the Bank issued subordinated notes (the Notes\u201d) totaling $9.5 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $9.2 million after issuance costs. The Notes have a maturity date of November 30, 2025, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.00% per annum. The Notes are non-callable for an initial period of five years and include provisions for redemption pricing between 101.5% and 100.5% of the liquidation value, if called after five years but prior to the maturity\ndate. Upon receipt of regulatory approvals in December 2015, First Priority Bank distributed $6.0 million of the proceeds from the subordinated note issuance to First Priority, and subsequently, in January 2016, First Priority utilized the distribution from the Bank to redeem 6,000 of the 9,404 outstanding shares of its 9.00% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, which was originally issued to the United States Department of the Treasury during 2009 as part of the TARP Capital Purchase Program ( TARP CPP\u201d), at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share, or $6.0 million, plus accrued dividends. First Priority Bank will utilize the remainder of the issuance for general corporate purposes. The distribution from First Priority Bank to First Priority received all required approvals, including from the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.\nThe ongoing financial benefit related to specifically utilizing $6.0 million of the subordinated debt issuance to redeem a like amount of preferred stock will increase income to common shareholders by $263 thousand on an annualized basis going forward. Dividends paid on preferred stock, calculated using a 9% dividend rate, will decline by $540 thousand annually after $6 million of the preferred stock is redeemed. Incremental interest expense, based on the subordinated debt interest rate of 7.0%, totals $420 thousand annually; however, this expense is tax deductible resulting in an income tax benefit of $143 thousand.\nCapital Resources\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 was $52.1 million, representing an increase of $1.9 million from $50.2 million at December 31, 2014. The enhanced capital position is attributable to net income of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, market volatility related to the investment securities portfolio resulting in a net unrealized gain position totaling $242 thousand and the reclassification of stock compensation expense of $327 thousand. These increases were partially offset by preferred dividends declared of $801 thousand.\nOn February 20, 2009, First Priority issued 4,579 shares of First Priority's Series A preferred stock and a warrant to purchase, on a net basis, 229 shares of First Priority's Series B preferred stock, which was immediately exercised, for an aggregate purchase price of $4.6 million under the TARP CPP. On December 18, 2009, First Priority issued 4,596 shares of Series C preferred stock, $100.00 par value per share, having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $4.6 million.\nAs noted in the Subordinated Debt section above, in January 2016, First Priority utilized $6 million of the proceeds received from the issuance of Tier 2 qualifying subordinated debt to redeem 6,000 shares of the Company's outstanding preferred stock. This redemption consisted of all outstanding shares of Series A and Series B, and 1,192 shares of the Series C preferred stock, which were redeemed on a pro rata basis, which subsequently leaves 3,404 shares of Series C outstanding. This redemption will also reduce the total amount of shareholders' equity reported by the amount of the redemption.\nFirst Priority Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on First Priority Bank's financial condition and results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, First Priority Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of First Priority Bank's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. First Priority Bank's capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors.\nFirst Priority Bank exceeds the minimum capital requirements established by regulatory agencies. Under the capital adequacy guidelines, capital is classified into two tiers. These guidelines require an institution to maintain a certain level of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders' equity and qualifying preferred stock, excluding the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale, minus certain intangible assets plus trust preferred securities up to 25% of Tier 1 capital, with the excess being treated as Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital also consists of the allowance for loan losses, subject to certain limitations, and qualifying subordinated debt. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 100% based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require First Priority Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets, known as the Tier 1 leverage ratio. The following table sets forth the capital ratios for both First Priority and First Priority Bank at December 31, 2015 and 2014. First Priority currently meets the definition of a small bank holding company\u201d under the FRB's regulations, and thus is not subject to any capital requirements; however, the Company meets the holding company regulatory requirements for well-capitalized\u201d for each stated period. First Priority Bank was considered well-capitalized\u201d and met or exceeded its applicable regulatory requirements for both periods.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> First Priority Financial Corp.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First Priority Bank\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For Capital Adequacy Purposes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> To Be Considered \"Well-Capitalized\"\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total risk-based capital\n</td> <td> 13.08%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.03%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.98%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.87%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 risk-based capital\n</td> <td> 10.07%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.36%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.97%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 common equity capital\n</td> <td> 9.60%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.97%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 leverage capital\n</td> <td> 8.19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.46%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.34%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ratios shown above, for both the Company and the Bank, include the impact related to the $9.5 million issuance of Tier 2 qualifying subordinated debt noted above as well as the subsequent distribution from the Bank to the Holding Company of $6 million related to the redemption of the Bank's common stock, which resulted in a reduction of Tier 1 capital at the Bank. Additionally, the regulatory capital utilized to calculate the consolidated ratios shown above does not include the $6 million of preferred stock which was redeemed in January 2016 due to the short-term commitment to redeem this capital.\nThe capital ratios above reflect the new capital requirements under \"Basel III\" effective during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank and the Company were in compliance with the new requirements. See Note 18 - Regulatory Matters for additional discussion regarding regulatory capital requirements.\nReturn on Average Equity and Assets\nThe following table shows the return on average assets (net income divided by total average assets), return on equity (net income divided by average equity), and the equity to assets ratio (average equity divided by total average assets) for each of the five years ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> At or for the years ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets...........................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.44%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.56%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.05%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.02%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average equity...........................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.47%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.26%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average equity to average assets ratio...\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.64%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.07%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.68%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe effect of relative purchasing power over time due to inflation has not been taken into effect in First Priority's consolidated financial statements. Rather, the statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nUnlike most industrial companies, the assets and liabilities of financial institutions, such as First Priority and First Priority Bank, are primarily monetary in nature. Therefore, the effect of changes in interest rates will have a more significant impact on its performance than will the effect of changing prices and inflation in general. In addition, interest rates may generally increase as the rate of inflation increases, although not necessarily in the same magnitude. First Priority seeks to manage the relationships between interest-sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough the operations of First Priority Bank, First Priority has made contractual commitments to extend credit, in the ordinary course of its business activities, to meet the financing needs of customers. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheets. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The same credit and collateral policies are used in making these commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and collateral is obtained, if necessary, based on the credit evaluation of the borrower. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by First Priority Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation. Collateral held varies, but may include personal or commercial real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, outstanding commitments to extend credit consisting of total unfunded commitments under lines of credit were $97.8 million and $83.2 million, respectively. In addition, as of each of these dates, there were $711 thousand and $349 million of performance standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively, and $1.1 million of financial standby letters of credit as of each respective date.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2014 the Bank pledged $214 thousand of deposit balances at a correspondent bank to support a letter of credit with a balance of $149 thousand, issued by the correspondent on behalf of a customer of the Bank. This transaction was fully secured by the customer through a pledge of the customer's deposits at the Bank. During 2015, First Priority Bank issued a letter of credit directly to the customer in relation to this transaction.\nFirst Priority is not involved in any other off-balance sheet contractual relationships, unconsolidated related entities that have off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments that could significantly impact earnings. First Priority believes that it has adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that may be drawn upon by borrowers.\nLiquidity\nThe objective of liquidity management is to assure that sufficient sources of funds are available, as needed and at a reasonable cost, to meet the ongoing and unexpected operational cash needs and commitments of First Priority and to take advantage of income producing opportunities as they arise. Sufficient liquidity must be available to meet the cash requirements of depositors wanting to withdraw funds and of borrowers wanting their credit needs met. Additionally, liquidity is needed to insure that First Priority has the ability to act at those times when profitable new lending and investment opportunities arise. While the desired level of liquidity may vary depending upon a variety of factors, it is a primary goal of First Priority to maintain adequate liquidity in all economic environments through active balance sheet management.\nLiquidity management is the ongoing process of monitoring and managing First Priority's sources and uses of funds. The primary sources of funds are deposits, scheduled amortization of loans outstanding, maturities and cash flow generated from the investment portfolio and funds provided by operations. Scheduled loan payments and investment maturities are relatively predictable sources of funds; however, deposit flows and loan prepayments are far less predictable and are influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions, local competition and customer preferences. Liquidity is also provided by unused lines of credit with correspondent banks and First Priority's borrowing capacity at the FHLB. First Priority measures and monitors its liquidity position on an ongoing basis in order to better understand, predict and respond to balance sheet trends, unused borrowing capacity and liquidity needs. The liquidity position is managed on a daily basis as part of the daily settlement function and on an ongoing basis through the asset liability management function.\nThe key elements of First Priority's liquidity planning process involve a primary focus on the development of a stable core funding base; utilization of wholesale funding sources to supplement core funding; maintenance of an appropriate level of asset liquidity; management of the maturity structure of funding sources and of funding concentrations; and maintenance of borrowing facilities.\nWholesale funding sources utilized by First Priority Bank include brokered certificates of deposits, secured advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, federal funds purchased and other secured borrowing facilities. At December 31, 2015, wholesale funding sources totaled $188.0 million and were comprised of $113.3 million of brokered certificates of deposit and $74.7 million of FHLB advances. At December 31, 2014, wholesale funding sources totaled $137.1 million and were comprised of $74.6 million of brokered certificates of deposit and $62.5 million FHLB advances. Wholesale funding is generally used in managing the daily liquidity needs and when it is the most cost effective funding source available to First Priority. Management continually evaluates all available funding sources for cost and availability.\nAn integral part of First Priority Bank's balance sheet management strategy is to establish and maintain borrowing facilities with correspondent banks for access to funding. Off balance sheet borrowing capacity provides the immediate availability of funds to meet short-term financing needs without requiring the bank to maintain excess liquidity in its investment portfolio, which may have a negative impact on earnings. In today's environment of historically low interest rates, it may also provide the most effective longer term funding, in terms of the cost and structure. Long term borrowings from the FHLB cannot be called prior to maturity, which provides much greater protection against a rise in interest rates when compared to retail deposits, which can be redeemed early by the depositor at lower than market rate penalties.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, First Priority Bank had a borrowing facility with a correspondent bank totaling $10 million, available for short-term limited purpose usage, of which $2 million is available unsecured. The remaining $8 million is a secured line of credit.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, First Priority Bank had a total borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $169 million and $144 million, respectively, with advances outstanding against this capacity of $74.7 million and $62.5 million, respectively.\nShort term liquid assets at December 31, 2015 totaled $52.4 million and were comprised of $2.4 million of interest bearing deposits held at correspondent banks and $50 million of investment securities available for sale due within 30 days. Short term liquid assets at December 31, 2014 totaled $32.8 million and were comprised of $2.8 million of interest bearing deposits held at correspondent banks and $30 million of investment securities due within 30 days.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nIt is the responsibility of the board of directors and senior management to understand and control the interest rate risk exposures assumed by First Priority. The board has delegated authority to the asset liability management committee ( ALCO\u201d) for the development of ALCO policies and for the management of the asset liability management function. The ALCO committee is comprised of senior management representing all primary functions of First Priority and meets monthly. ALCO has the responsibility for maintaining a level of interest rate risk exposures within board of director approved limits.\nThe primary objective of asset liability management is to optimize net interest income over time while maintaining a balance sheet mix that is prudent with respect to liquidity, capital adequacy and interest rate risk. The absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on the profitability of First Priority. Interest rate risk management is the process of identifying and controlling the potential adverse impact of interest rates movements on First Priority's net interest income and on the fair value of its assets and liabilities.\nOne tool used to monitor interest rate risk is the measurement of its interest sensitivity gap,\u201d which is the positive or negative dollar difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by changing the mix, pricing and repricing characteristics of First Priority's assets and liabilities, through management of its investment portfolio, loan and deposit product offerings, and through wholesale funding. Managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates. First Priority generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset-sensitive gap position and generally would benefit from decreasing market rates of interest when First Priority is liability-sensitive.\nAt December 31, 2015, First Priority was liability sensitive at the one-year gap position, as it has more liabilities subject to repricing in the subsequent twelve month period than assets. It must be noted, however, that the gap analysis is not a precise indicator of First Priority's exposure to changing interest rates. The analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. Furthermore, the results are influenced by management assumptions concerning the repricing characteristics of deposit products with no contractual maturities, the timing of the repricing of variable rate loans with interest rates currently fixed at interest rate floors, and prepayment speeds of loans and investments subject to prepayment prior to maturity. Additionally, net interest income performance may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment, including changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe Company's interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2015, as measured by the repricing characteristics of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities, is presented in the following table. As noted above, the table presents data at a single point in time and includes significant management assumptions.\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest Rate Sensitivity

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion summarizes First Priority's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and its financial condition as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and highlights material changes. This discussion is intended to provide additional information about the significant changes in the results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, contained in this document, for First Priority and its wholly owned subsidiary, First Priority Bank. First Priority's consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist essentially of First Priority Bank's financial condition and results of operations. Current performance does not guarantee, and may not be indicative of, similar performance in the future. This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as First Priority's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.\nReaders should note that many factors, some of which are discussed elsewhere in this report, could affect the future financial results of First Priority and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this document.\nOverview\nThe following table sets forth selected measures of First Priority's financial position or performance for the dates or periods indicated (dollars in thousands).\n\n_____________________\n (1) Total revenue equals net interest income plus non-interest income. \n (2) Net income in 2014 includes a tax benefit of $4.50 million resulting from the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. \nLike most financial institutions, First Priority derives the majority of its income from interest it receives on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments. First Priority's primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is its deposits, on which it pays interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of First Priority's success is its amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on its average interest-earning assets and the expense on its average interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the spread between the yield First Priority earns on these average interest-earning assets and the rate it pays on its average interest-bearing liabilities, which is called its net interest spread.\nThere are risks inherent in all loans, and First Priority maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb potential losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. This allowance is maintained by charging a provision for loan losses against operating earnings. A detailed discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing the allowance for loan losses is included herein.\nIn addition to earning interest on its loans and investments, First Priority earns income through other sources, such as fees and other charges to its banking customers and income from providing wealth management services, as well as net gains or losses realized from the sale of assets. The various components of non-interest income, as well as non-interest expense, are described in this section.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nFirst Priority has adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that are consistent with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. First Priority's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by First Priority that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. First Priority considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting estimates. The judgment and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors, which First Priority believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and have been reasonably consistent with prior results. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made, actual results could differ from these estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of its assets and liabilities and its results of operations. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to investment securities impairment evaluation, the valuation of acquired loans, the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of other real estate owned, the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill, the valuation of deferred tax assets and accounting for stock-based compensation.\nInvestment Securities Impairment Evaluation. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. When a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists but the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the debt security prior to its anticipated recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit loss) and (b) the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. Management believes that there are no investment securities with other-than-temporary impairment for each of the reporting periods presented.\nAcquired Loans. Fair values for acquired loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant assumptions and judgments as to estimate of credit risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values and discount rate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans.\nPools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates in each category of loans and adjusted for qualitative factors. Management assigned each factor a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on its best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nAn unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.\nImpairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nSee the Allowance for Loan Losses sections related to Balance Sheet Review as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 for more information.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Any write-down, at or prior to the dates the real estate is considered foreclosed, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets ( DTA\u201d) are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.\nTemporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with the Bank.\nIf management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.\nWhen determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance, the Company assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards, as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 740-10-30-18. This guidance related to when a valuation allowance on the DTA should be maintained, generally provides that the valuation allowance should be reversed, when in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that the DTA will be realized. Management has determined that the DTA will be realized and does not maintain a valuation allowance.\nStock Based Compensation. Compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions are recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on management's assumptions. Therefore value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the estimated fair value of the shares at the date of the award.\nResults of Operations\nIncome Statement Review\nFirst Priority's results of operations are affected by five major elements: (1) net interest income, or the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense accrued on deposits and borrowed funds; (2) the provision for loan losses, or the amount added to the allowance for loan losses to provide reserves for inherent losses on loans; (3) non-interest income, consisting of income from wealth management services, fees and other charges to our banking customers, and net gains or losses realized from the sale of assets; (4) non-interest expense, which consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and other operating expenses; and (5) income taxes, including deferred taxes, when applicable. Each of these major elements is reviewed in more detail in the following discussion.\nResults of Operations Comparative Summary\nShown in the table below are the reported results of operations as well as the increase (decrease) for the respective periods.\n\nSummary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, First Priority's consolidated income before income taxes increased 26% to $3.05 million compared to $2.42 million for the same period of 2014. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $2.11 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted common share after preferred dividends totaling $801 thousand. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, including a tax benefit totaling $4.50 million totaled $6.93 million, or $0.98 per basic and diluted common share after preferred dividends totaling $579 thousand paid during the period. During the third quarter of 2014, the Company reversed the valuation allowance related to its net deferred tax asset and, accordingly, recognized a tax benefit in that quarter of $4.71 million.\nNet Interest Income\nFirst Priority's primary source of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is determined by the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned and paid on these balances. The amount of net interest income recorded by First Priority is affected by the rate, mix and amount of growth of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amount of interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities, and by changes in interest rates earned and interest rates paid on these assets and liabilities.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, information related to First Priority's average balances, yields on average assets, and costs of average liabilities. Average balances are derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated and yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. Average loans are stated net of deferred costs. The net dollar amounts and percentage changes of interest income and expense are presented for comparative purposes.\nAnalysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\n\n (1) Interest income includes dividends from restricted investments in Bank stocks, average balance of these restricted stocks are included in non-interest-earning assets. \nNet interest income can also be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume as shown in the Changes in Net Interest Income table below which sets forth the effect which varying levels of average interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and the applicable yields and rates have had on changes in net interest income for the periods presented.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net interest income increased 2.60%, or $410 thousand, to $16.19 million compared to $15.78 million for the same period in 2014. Net interest margin declined 20 basis points from 3.70% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3.50% for the same period in 2015. Net interest spread, defined as the mathematical difference between the yield on average earning assets and the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities, declined 20 basis points from 3.55% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3.35% for the same period in 2015. When comparing these periods, incremental growth of balances accounted for an increase of $1.17 million while the change in our relative rate structure resulted in a decline in net interest income of $760 thousand.\nAverage interest earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $35.3 million, or 8.3%, including increases in average loans of $32.3 million, or 9.1%, and average investment balances of $5.3 million, or 8.1%, when compared to the prior year. This increased volume of average earning assets provided an additional $1.68 million in interest income, $1.49 million provided from incremental loan balances and $194 thousand from investment securities, including deposits with banks. The average yield on earning assets declined 15 basis points in the current year compared to the prior year from 4.37% to 4.22%, which resulted in a decline of interest income between the periods of $817 thousand. Of this decline, $916 thousand was related to lower yields on loans partially offset by a net increase of $99 thousand related to investment securities, deposits with other banks and other investment income, including an increase of $72 thousand related to dividends paid on FHLB restricted stock outstanding during the period.\nAverage interest bearing liabilities increased $32.6 million, or 9.3%, in 2015. During this time, overall deposit balances increased $28.9 million, as time deposits grew $40.8 million, while interest bearing demand deposits decreased $6.9 million and money market and savings deposits decreased $5.0 million. At the same time, borrowed funds increased $3.7 million. The incremental growth of interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase of interest expense of $510 thousand. Additionally, the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased 5 basis points from 0.82% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 0.87% in the current year; however, due to the changing mix among products, interest expense related to average rates on interest bearing liabilities declined by $57 thousand when comparing the two years.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, First Priority's balance sheet was moderately liability sensitive, which suggests that First Priority would experience moderate net interest margin compression in a rising interest rate environment.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged against operations. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance as recoveries.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on known or potential risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, the composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.\nAt the end of each quarter or more often, if necessary, First Priority analyzes the collectability of its loans and accordingly adjusts the loan loss allowance to an appropriate level. The allowance for loan losses covers estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans that are determined to be impaired, as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio. For a description of the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, see the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section below.\nThe provision for loan losses was $610 thousand in 2015 compared to $1.13 million for 2014. The level of provision is impacted by the adequacy of the allowance as described above, including an analysis of impaired and non-performing loans, as well as by the level of incremental loan volume and net charge-offs of loans. Total loans increased $33.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and $39.5 million during 2014. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, totaled $128 thousand and $1.09 million, respectively. 2014 included a charge-off of $513 thousand related to a non-performing commercial line of credit, resulting from an updated appraisal value indicating a shortfall in the collateral position. The allowance for loan losses was $2.8 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which represented 0.68% and 0.62% of total loans outstanding at each respective date.\nAcquired loans are initially recorded at acquisition date at their acquisition date fair values, and therefore, are excluded from the calculation of loan loss reserves as of the acquisition date. As acquired loans are paid off or are refinanced or\nextended under First Priority's credit underwriting process, they are no longer considered acquired loans, but instead are prospectively considered originated loans and therefore, are included as part of the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. To the extent there is a decrease in the present value of cash flows from acquired impaired loans after the date of acquisition, the Company records a provision for loan losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $230 thousand related to acquired loans, of which $127 thousand related to net charge-offs on non-credit impaired purchased loans while charge-offs related to acquired loans which were initially considered credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date were $73 thousand. As of December 31, 2015, there was $30 thousand specifically designated within the Company's allowance for loan losses related to acquired loans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $425 thousand related to acquired loans. There were charge-offs recorded during 2014 totaling $250 thousand related to loans that were initially considered credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date while net charge-offs on non-credit impaired purchased loans totaled $175 thousand during 2014. As of December 31, 2014, there were no loans for which any portion of the Company's allowance for loan losses was specifically designated", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion summarizes First Priority's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and its financial condition as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and highlights material changes.

Management believes that there are no investment securities with other-than-temporary impairment for each of the reporting periods presented.\nAcquired Loans. Fair values for acquired loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant assumptions and judgments as to estimate of credit risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values and discount rate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans.\nPools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates in each category of loans and adjusted for qualitative factors. Management assigned each factor a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on its best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nAn unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.\nImpairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.\nSee the Allowance for Loan Losses sections related to Balance Sheet Review as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 for more information.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Any write-down, at or prior to the dates the real estate is considered foreclosed, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment.\nIncome Taxes. Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets ( DTA\u201d) are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.\nTemporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with the Bank.\nIf management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.\nWhen determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance, the Company assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards, as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 740-10-30-18. This guidance related to when a valuation allowance on the DTA should be maintained, generally provides that the valuation allowance should be reversed, when in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that the DTA will be realized. Management has determined that the DTA will be realized and does not maintain a valuation allowance.\nStock Based Compensation. Compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions are recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on management's assumptions. Therefore value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the estimated fair value of the shares at the date of the award.\nResults of Operations\nIncome Statement Review\nFirst Priority's results of operations are affected by five major elements: (1) net interest income, or the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense accrued on deposits and borrowed funds; (2) the provision for loan losses, or the amount added to the allowance for loan losses to provide reserves for inherent losses on loans; (3) non-interest income, consisting of income from wealth management services, fees and other charges to our banking customers, and net gains or losses realized from the sale of assets; (4) non-interest expense, which consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and other operating expenses; and (5) income taxes, including deferred taxes, when applicable. Each of these major elements is reviewed in more detail in the following discussion.\nResults of Operations Comparative Summary\nShown in the table below are the reported results of operations as well as the increase (decrease) for the respective periods.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (decrease)\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands, except per share data):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income..................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 16,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 15,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 410\n</td> <td> 2.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenue....................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses........................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (522)\n</td> <td> (46.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expenses............................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income tax (benefit) expense .................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal income tax (benefit) expense ...................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,502)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income .........................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 2,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 6,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (4,813)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred dividends, including net warrant amortization...\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income to common shareholders.............................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 6,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ (5,035)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic....................................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted.................................................................................\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ 0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSummary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, First Priority's consolidated income before income taxes increased 26% to $3.05 million compared to $2.42 million for the same period of 2014. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $2.11 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted common share after preferred dividends totaling $801 thousand. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, including a tax benefit totaling $4.50 million totaled $6.93 million, or $0.98 per basic and diluted common share after preferred dividends totaling $579 thousand paid during the period. During the third quarter of 2014, the Company reversed the valuation allowance related to its net deferred tax asset and, accordingly, recognized a tax benefit in that quarter of $4.71 million.\nNet Interest Income\nFirst Priority's primary source of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is determined by the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned and paid on these balances. The amount of net interest income recorded by First Priority is affected by the rate, mix and amount of growth of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amount of interest-earning assets as compared to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities, and by changes in interest rates earned and interest rates paid on these assets and liabilities.\nThe following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, information related to First Priority's average balances, yields on average assets, and costs of average liabilities. Average balances are derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated and yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. Average loans are stated net of deferred costs. The net dollar amounts and percentage changes of interest income and expense are presented for comparative purposes.\nAnalysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

period in 2014. Net interest margin declined 20 basis points from 3.70% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3.50% for the same period in 2015. Net interest spread, defined as the mathematical difference between the yield on average earning assets and the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities, declined 20 basis points from 3.55% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3.35% for the same period in 2015. When comparing these periods, incremental growth of balances accounted for an increase of $1.17 million while the change in our relative rate structure resulted in a decline in net interest income of $760 thousand.\nAverage interest earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $35.3 million, or 8.3%, including increases in average loans of $32.3 million, or 9.1%, and average investment balances of $5.3 million, or 8.1%, when compared to the prior year. This increased volume of average earning assets provided an additional $1.68 million in interest income, $1.49 million provided from incremental loan balances and $194 thousand from investment securities, including deposits with banks. The average yield on earning assets declined 15 basis points in the current year compared to the prior year from 4.37% to 4.22%, which resulted in a decline of interest income between the periods of $817 thousand. Of this decline, $916 thousand was related to lower yields on loans partially offset by a net increase of $99 thousand related to investment securities, deposits with other banks and other investment income, including an increase of $72 thousand related to dividends paid on FHLB restricted stock outstanding during the period.\nAverage interest bearing liabilities increased $32.6 million, or 9.3%, in 2015. During this time, overall deposit balances increased $28.9 million, as time deposits grew $40.8 million, while interest bearing demand deposits decreased $6.9 million and money market and savings deposits decreased $5.0 million. At the same time, borrowed funds increased $3.7 million. The incremental growth of interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase of interest expense of $510 thousand. Additionally, the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased 5 basis points from 0.82% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 0.87% in the current year; however, due to the changing mix among products, interest expense related to average rates on interest bearing liabilities declined by $57 thousand when comparing the two years.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, First Priority's balance sheet was moderately liability sensitive, which suggests that First Priority would experience moderate net interest margin compression in a rising interest rate environment.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged against operations. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance as recoveries.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on known or potential risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, the composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.\nAt the end of each quarter or more often, if necessary, First Priority analyzes the collectability of its loans and accordingly adjusts the loan loss allowance to an appropriate level. The allowance for loan losses covers estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans that are determined to be impaired, as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio. For a description of the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, see the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section below.\nThe provision for loan losses was $610 thousand in 2015 compared to $1.13 million for 2014. The level of provision is impacted by the adequacy of the allowance as described above, including an analysis of impaired and non-performing loans, as well as by the level of incremental loan volume and net charge-offs of loans. Total loans increased $33.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and $39.5 million during 2014. Net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, totaled $128 thousand and $1.09 million, respectively. 2014 included a charge-off of $513 thousand related to a non-performing commercial line of credit, resulting from an updated appraisal value indicating a shortfall in the collateral position. The allowance for loan losses was $2.8 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which represented 0.68% and 0.62% of total loans outstanding at each respective date.\nAcquired loans are initially recorded at acquisition date at their acquisition date fair values, and therefore, are excluded from the calculation of loan loss reserves as of the acquisition date. As acquired loans are paid off or are refinanced or\nextended under First Priority's credit underwriting process, they are no longer considered acquired loans, but instead are prospectively considered originated loans and therefore, are included as part of the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. To the extent there is a decrease in the present value of cash flows from acquired impaired loans after the date of acquisition, the Company records a provision for loan losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $230 thousand related to acquired loans, of which $127 thousand related to net charge-offs on non-credit impaired purchased loans while charge-offs related to acquired loans which were initially considered credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date were $73 thousand. As of December 31, 2015, there was $30 thousand specifically designated within the Company's allowance for loan losses related to acquired loans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling $425 thousand related to acquired loans. There were charge-offs recorded during 2014 totaling $250 thousand related to loans that were initially considered credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date while net charge-offs on non-credit impaired purchased loans totaled $175 thousand during 2014. As of December 31, 2014, there were no loans for which any portion of the Company's allowance for loan losses was specifically designated"}
