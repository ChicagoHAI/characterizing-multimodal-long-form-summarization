In comparison, we reported net income of $2.0 billion ($3.49 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $27.2 billion for 2017, and $3.8 billion ($6.89 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $25.5 billion for 2016.\nOur common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 11.2% and 10.3% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See MD&A-Capital Management\u201d below for additional information.\nOn June 28, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of our common stock ( 2018 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d) beginning in the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. We completed the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this Report and Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Report for factors that could materially influence our results.\nTotal Company Expectations\nWe expect that our full-year 2019 operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, will improve modestly, excluding the $225 million one-time Walmart launch and integration expenses.\nWhile efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long term, we continue to believe that we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains.\nWe believe we have sufficient capital and earnings to support growth, the Walmart portfolio acquisition, the phased-in impact of adopting CECL on January 1, 2020, as well as the potential for a meaningful capital distribution in the 2019 CCAR window.\nWe continue to believe increases in deposit costs and deposit product mix changes will have a negative impact on our net interest margin going forward.\nBusiness Segment Expectations\nDomestic Card: In our Domestic Card business, we expect to incur approximately $225 million in one-time expenses in 2019 to launch the new Walmart originations programs and integrate the acquired portfolio. We expect these costs will ramp up over the course of 2019.\nWe currently estimate the initial allowance build for the acquired Walmart portfolio will be approximately $120 million. The actual impact will depend on the amount and characteristics of the receivables as well as economic conditions and our loss forecasts at the acquisition date.\nConsumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we expect further increases in average deposit interest rate as product mix shift continues. Increasing competition for deposits will also put upward pressure on deposit rates.\nOver the longer-term, we continue to expect that the charge-off rate in our auto finance business will increase gradually.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2018 and 2017. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, MD&A-Business Segment Financial Performance.\u201d You should read this section together with our MD&A-Executive Summary and Business Outlook,\u201d where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 1 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to support the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.\nInvestment Securities\nOur investment securities portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ( Agency\u201d) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS\u201d); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS\u201d); and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae\u201d) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac\u201d) issued securities. The U.S. Treasury and Agency securities generally have high credit ratings and low credit risks, and our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 96% and 95% of our total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio increased by $8.5 billion to $46.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily due to a one-time transfer of held to maturity securities to available for sale as a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2017-12. The fair value of our held to maturity securities portfolio increased by $7.2 billion to $36.6 billion as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by purchases in the second

Other debt primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes, Federal Home Loan Banks ( FHLB\u201d) advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase.\nTable 7 provides the composition of our primary sources of funding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 7: Funding Sources Composition\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits:(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer Banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total funding sources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>303,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes brokered deposits of $21.2 billion and $25.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Total deposits increased by $6.1 billion to $249.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by strong growth in our deposit products as a result of our national banking growth strategy in our Consumer Banking business, partially offset by a decrease in deposits from Commercial Banking business due to deposit customers rotating out of deposit products and into higher-yielding investments.\nSecuritized debt obligations decreased by $1.7 billion to $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017, as debt maturities exceeded issuances during the year ended of 2018.\nOther debt remained substantially flat at $40.6 billion as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe provide additional information on our funding sources in MD&A-Liquidity Risk Profile\u201d and in Note 9-Deposits and Borrowings.\u201d\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that these future deductions are more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.\nDeferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, were approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $719 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease in our net deferred tax assets was primarily driven by a tax benefit of $284 million as a result of an approval from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to a tax methodology change on rewards costs and the reversal of certain other items related to the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio.\nWe have recorded valuation allowances of $245 million and $226 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect to fully realize the 2018 net deferred tax asset amounts in future periods. If changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income.\nWe provide additional information on income taxes in MD&A-Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d and in Note 16-Income Taxes.\u201d\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in Note 6-Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations\u201d and Note 19-Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.\u201d\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category.\nThe results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched maturity method that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. The allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods.\nWe refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed\u201d presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe summarize our business segment results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nTable 327: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nLoan Loss Reserves\nWe maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management's estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. We also separately reserve for binding unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. We build our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses, which is driven by charge-offs, changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance totaled $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2018, compared to $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nWe have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses. At least quarterly, the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and representatives from Finance and Risk Management review and assess our allowance methodologies and the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. This assessment involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses. Key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates, home prices and the valuation of commercial properties, consumer real estate, automobiles and other collateral.\nIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we review and assess our estimate of probable losses related to binding unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and unfunded loan commitments on a quarterly basis. The factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the Commercial Banking business. Changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAlthough we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. Accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d We provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in Note 5-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.\u201d\nFinance Charge and Fee Reserves\nFinance charges and fees on credit card loans are recorded in revenue when earned. Billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loan receivables net of amounts that we consider uncollectible. Unbilled finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in interest receivable. We continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off. However, when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our\nTable 332: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ncredit card loan receivables and revenue by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected. Total net revenue was reduced by $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $468 million and $491 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nWe review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis. Our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables.\nAsset Impairment\nIn addition to our loan portfolio, we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. This process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions. Below we describe our process for assessing impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets, consist primarily of purchased credit card relationships ( PCCR\u201d) and other intangibles.\nGoodwill totaled $14.5 billion as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017. The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased to $254 million as of December 31, 2018, from $421 million as of December 31, 2017 primarily due to amortization. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment in 2018, 2017 or 2016. See Note 7-Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d for additional information.\nGoodwill\nWe perform our goodwill impairment test annually on October 1 at a reporting unit level. We are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances make it more-likely-than-not that impairment may have occurred. We have four reporting units: Credit Card, Auto, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.\nThe goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, management must estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit's balance sheet based on applicable accounting guidance in order to measure the impairment.\nFor the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing, we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit's specific regulatory capital requirements, economic capital requirements, and underlying risks. The carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and intangibles balances. We then compare the carrying amount to our total consolidated stockholders' equity to assess the reasonableness of our methodology. The total carrying amount of our four reporting units was $43.3 billion, as compared to consolidated stockholder's equity of $50.6 billion as of October 1, 2018. The $7.3 billion excess in consolidated stockholder's equity was primarily attributable to capital allocated to our Other category and other future capital needs such as dividends or other strategic initiatives.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit and the associated assets, liabilities and intangible assets, is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment. We calculated the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) calculation, a form of the income approach. This income approach calculation used projected cash flows based on each reporting unit's internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. Our DCF analysis required management to make estimates about future loan, deposit and revenue growth, as well as credit losses and capital rates. These cash flows and terminal values were then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of capital with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. The reasonableness of the DCF approach was assessed by reference to a market-based approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available. The results of the 2018 annual impairment test for the Credit Card, Auto, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values of these four reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts.\nTable 333: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain. A significant change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit, such as declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, deterioration of market conditions, adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital, could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future, and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying amount. There were no meaningful impairments of intangible assets in 2018 and 2017. We recorded an impairment charge of $17 million in 2016 related primarily to our brokerage relationship intangibles.\nSee Note 7-Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d for additional information.\nFair Value\nFair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. When quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. Changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.\nWe have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. If markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs.\nSignificant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments' fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. We discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in Note 17-Fair Value Measurement.\u201d\nWe have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control\nTable 334: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nprocesses include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification, and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results.\nGroups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information.\nOur Fair Value Committee ( FVC\u201d), which includes representation from business areas, Risk Management and Finance, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance.\nWe have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. The Model Risk Office validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance.\nThe fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee ( VAC\u201d) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC convenes to review escalated valuation disputes.\nCustomer Rewards Reserve\nWe offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, travel, or covering eligible charges. The amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. The majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn. Customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors such as card member purchase volume, the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost. We establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management's judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost.\nWe use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. Our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. We use a weighted-average redemption cost during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including the mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. We continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors. We recognized customer rewards expense of $4.4 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our customer rewards reserve, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTable 335: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for information on the accounting standards we adopted in 2018 and the expected impacts of accounting standards issued but not adopted as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 336: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Banking Agencies, including the Basel III Capital Rule. Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to PCA capital regulations.\nWe entered parallel run under Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we are required to calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we continue to use the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. Under the Basel III Capital Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be determined by the greater of our risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. Once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the Basel III Capital Rule from our regulators, any amount by which our expected credit losses exceed eligible credit reserves, as each term is defined under the Basel III Capital Rule, will be deducted from our Basel III Standardized Approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. Inclusive of this impact, based on current capital rules and our business mix, we estimate that our Basel III Advanced Approaches ratios will be lower than our Basel III Standardized Approach ratios. However, there is uncertainty whether this will remain the case in light of potential changes to the United States capital rules.\nThe Basel III Capital Rule also introduced the supplementary leverage ratio for all Advanced Approaches banking organizations with a minimum requirement of 3.0%. The supplementary leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, which includes all on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures, including derivatives and unused commitments. Given that we are in our Basel III Advanced Approaches parallel run, we calculate the ratio based on Tier 1 capital under the Standardized Approach. The minimum requirement for the supplementary leverage ratio became effective as of January 1, 2018.\nThe Market Risk Rule supplements both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches by requiring institutions subject to the Market Risk Rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. As of December 31, 2018, the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See MD&A-Market Risk Profile\u201d below for additional information.\nIn October 2018, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed to provide tailored requirements for certain of the capital rules for different categories of banking institutions. As proposed, these categories would be determined by an institution's asset size, with adjustments to a more stringent category possible if the institution meets certain other thresholds. As a BHC with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion, we would be a Category III institution under the Tailoring Proposed Rule. As such, we would no longer be subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches and certain associated capital requirements, although we would remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer and supplementary leverage ratio, which are currently required only for Basel III Advanced Approaches institutions. The financial and operational impact on us of the Tailoring Proposed Rule remains uncertain until a final rule is published.\nIn December 2018, the Federal Banking Agencies issued a final rule to address regulatory capital treatment under the CECL model. The CECL model will be applicable to Capital One as of January 1, 2020. The CECL Capital Rule revises the Federal Banking Agencies' regulatory capital rules to identify which credit loss allowances under the CECL model are eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital and to provide banking organizations the option to phase in over three years the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the CECL model. The effects of the CECL Capital Rule on our capital requirements are currently uncertain.\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td>

capitalized under PCA requirements as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe Basel III Capital Rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of common equity Tier 1 capital, of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratios. The capital conservation buffer was 1.875% in 2018 and is fully phased-in at 2.5% as of January 1, 2019.\nFor banks subject to the Advanced Approaches, including the Company and the Banks, the capital conservation buffer may be supplemented by an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% composed of common equity Tier 1 capital and set at the discretion of the Federal Banking Agencies. As of December 31, 2018, the countercyclical capital buffer was zero percent in the United States. A determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date.\nFor 2018, the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 6.375%, 7.875% and 9.875%, respectively, for the Company and the Banks. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, or total capital ratio below the applicable regulatory minimum ratio plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable countercyclical buffer (if set to an amount greater than zero percent) might restrict a bank's ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. As of December 31, 2018, the Company and each of the Banks were all above the applicable combined thresholds.\nTable 350: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing\nOn April 5, 2018, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the 2018 CCAR cycle. On June 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve informed us that they had no objection\u201d to our CCAR 2018 Capital Plan submission. As a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of our common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Board of Directors also authorized the dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share in each quarter in 2018.

As a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of December 31, 2018, funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $3.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. Consistent with our 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. We completed the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time.

We execute against our risk framework with the Three Lines of Defense\u201d risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk.\nThe First Line of Defense\u201d is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk. This principle places ultimate accountability for the management of risks and ownership of risk decisions with the CEO and business heads. The Second Line of Defense\u201d provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk appetite and the strategies, policies and structures for managing risks. The second line is both an expert advisor\u201d to the first line and an effective challenger\u201d of first line risk activities. The Third Line of Defense\u201d is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.\nThe risk framework is also used to guide design of risk programs and performance of risk activity within each risk category and across the entire enterprise.\nOur risk framework, which is built around governance, processes and people, consists of the following eight key elements:\nEstablish Governance Processes, Accountabilities and Risk Appetites\nThe starting point of our risk framework is the establishment of governance processes, accountabilities and risk appetites. Our Board of Directors and senior management establish the tone at the top regarding the importance of internal control, including standards of conduct and the integrity and ethical values of the Company. Management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization. This portion of the framework sets the foundation for the methods for governing risk taking, the interactions within and among the lines of defense, and the risk appetites and tolerance limits for risk taking.\nIdentify and Assess Risks and Ownership\nIdentifying and assessing risks and ownership is the beginning of the more detailed day-to-day process of managing risk. This portion of the framework clarifies the importance of strong first-line management and accountability for identifying and assessing risk while specifying the role of the second line to identify and assess risk, particularly when taking on new initiatives.\nDevelop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans\nWe develop, operate and monitor controls to manage risk within tolerance levels. The first line develops controls to oversee and manage identified risks. Controls may prevent risks from occurring or measure the amount of risk being taken so that the amount may be proactively managed. Whenever possible, plans are implemented to mitigate risks or reduce them to lower levels. The first line leads mitigation, control and monitoring actions. The second line is a consultant on control design when needed.\nTest and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action\nWhile the first line is principally accountable for taking, controlling and monitoring risk, the second line oversees and monitors first line risk taking, including the effectiveness of first line controls, and the third line independently tests and oversees first and second line risk taking. These activities provide the second and third lines of defense with the ability to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unplanned risk taking within the organization. Control gaps are closed by first line corrective action.\nEscalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and When Appropriate, the Board of Directors\nEscalation is an important component of our risk framework. Use of escalation is encouraged and does not necessarily indicate a failure on the part of first, second, or third line risk management. Through escalation in the first line, decisions requiring judgment can be raised to executives who have the broadest possible context and experience to make challenging decisions. Escalation in the second and third lines of defense can also demonstrate part of their core responsibilities of effective challenge. If appropriate,\nTable 354: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nrisks are escalated to the Board of Directors to ensure alignment with the most material risk decisions and/or transparency to the largest risks facing the organization.\nCalculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing)\nCapital ultimately is held to protect the company from unforeseen risks or unexpected risk severity. As such, it is important that capital planning processes be well linked with risk management practices to ensure the appropriate capital protections are in place for the safety and soundness of the company. Stress testing and economic capital measurement, both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum, are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns.\nSupport with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills\nThe right culture, talent and skills are critical to effective risk management. Our risk framework is supported with the right culture that promotes the foundation and values of the risk management organization. Skills necessary to effectively manage risk are reinforced through performance management systems. When needed, risk talent is augmented through recruitment of industry experts as well as training and development of internal associates.\nEnabled by the Right Data, Infrastructure and Programs\nData, infrastructure and programs are key enablers of our risk management processes and practices. These core requirements enable effective risk modeling, efficient first, second and third line risk activity performance, and cross-line interaction. In addition, effective program design of each risk category is regularly assessed to ensure risk practices continue to evolve with leading industry practices, and continue to interact across categories as desired for a strong overall risk management program.\nRisk Appetite\nRisk appetite defines the parameters for taking and accepting risks and are used by management and our Board of Directors to make business decisions. Risk appetite refers to the level of risk our business is willing to take in pursuit of our corporate business objectives. The Board of Directors approves our risk appetite including risk appetite statements and associated metrics, Board Notification Thresholds, and Board Limits for each of our eight risk categories. We communicate risk appetite statements, limits and thresholds to the appropriate levels in the organization and monitor adherence. While first line executives manage risk on a day-to-day basis, the Chief Risk Officer provides effective challenge and independent oversight to ensure that risks are within the appetite and specific limits established by the Board of Directors. The Chief Risk Officer reports to the Board of Directors regularly on the nature and level of risk across all eight risk categories. In addition to his broader management responsibilities, our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for developing the strategy and mission of our organization, determining and leading our culture, and reviewing and providing input into our risk appetite.\nRisk Categories\nWe apply our risk framework to protect our company from the eight major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. Our eight major categories of risk are:\nTable 355: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Compliance Risk: Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations.

In response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance risk program to fully address these expectations.\nOur Compliance Management Program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. The program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors.\nThe Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Compliance Risk Management Program. Business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. They regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and Corporate Compliance periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls.\nCredit Risk Management\nWe recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. Consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. Our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. In unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. In commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral, covenants and guarantees. In addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans.\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit Officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending related transactions. These responsibilities are fulfilled by the Chief Consumer Credit Officer and the Chief Commercial Credit Officer who are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and for oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. The Chief Consumer Credit Officer and the Chief Commercial Credit Officer have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. Division Presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. In addition, the Chief Risk Officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio.\nOur credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation and portfolio management. The standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. These standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. Starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. We monitor\nTable 364: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nperformance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors.\nLegal Risk Management\nThe General Counsel provides legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas and partners with other risk management functions such as Compliance and Internal Audit. This evaluation and guidance is based on an assessment of the type and degree of legal risk associated with the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate legal risks.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nWe manage liquidity risk by applying our Liquidity Adequacy Framework (the Framework\u201d). The Framework uses internal and regulatory stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise as a consequence of systemic or idiosyncratic liquidity events. We continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and appropriate action plans in accordance with our Contingency Funding Plan, which includes the Company's policies, procedures and action plans for managing liquidity stress events. The Framework enables us to manage our liquidity risk in accordance with regulatory requirements.\nAdditionally, the Framework establishes governing principles that apply to the management of liquidity risk. We use these principles to monitor, measure and report liquidity risk; to develop funding and investment strategies that enable us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to support our businesses and satisfy regulatory requirements; and to protect us from a broad range of liquidity events should they arise.\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. We assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation through idiosyncratic, systemic, and combined liquidity stress scenarios. Management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our Board of Directors no less than quarterly.\nWe seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. From a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and actively monitor our funding concentration. From a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash and cash equivalents, high-quality, unencumbered securities and committed collateralized credit lines. We also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured debt markets through regular issuance. This combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enable us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position.\nMarket Risk Management\nThe Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk Officer are responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. Market risk is inherent from the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. We manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to monitor and control our exposure.\nWe recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is inherent in the banking business due to the nature of the assets and liabilities of banks. Banks typically manage the trade-off between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each. In addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. Investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate and foreign exchange risk.\nThe market risk positions for the Company and each of the Banks are calculated separately and in aggregate, and analyzed against pre-established limits. Results are reported to the Asset Liability Committee monthly and to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors no less than quarterly. Management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure.\nTable 365: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperational Risk Management\nWe recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on both a strategic and day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. We have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and controls to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences and to achieve business objectives in a controlled manner.\nThe Chief Operational Risk Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Operational Risk Management Program. In accordance with Basel III Advanced Approaches requirements, the program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks. Corporate Operational Risk Management enforces these practices and delivers reporting of operational risk results to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the Board of Directors.\nReputation Risk Management\nWe recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions and, increasingly, technology companies, in the current environment. Areas of concern have expanded to include company policies, practices and values and, with the growing use of social and digital platforms, public corporations face a new level of scrutiny and channels for activism and advocacy. The heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture, values and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change. We manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials, media, community and consumer advocates, customers and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry. Our actions include implementing pro-customer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank and an innovative technology leader. The Executive Vice President of External Affairs is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. Day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our Reputation Risk Management Policy and other risk management policies.\nStrategic Risk Management\nWe monitor external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk. These items provide input for development of the Company's strategy led by the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. Through the ongoing development and vetting of the corporate strategy, the Chief Risk Officer identifies and assesses risks associated with the strategy across all risk categories and monitors them throughout the year.\nTable 366: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CREDIT RISK PROFILE\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.\nWe also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under MD&A-Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis-Investment Securities\u201d and credit risk related to derivative transactions in Note 10-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\u201d\nPrimary Loan Products\nWe provide a variety of lending products. Our primary loan products include credit cards, auto loans and commercial lending products. We sold all of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing during 2018.\nTable 367: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Credit cards: We originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. Our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. Credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. The underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ninformation, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO, and on other factors, such as applicant income. We maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans.\nTable 369: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Auto: We originate both prime and subprime auto loans through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. Our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less, but can go up to 84 months. Loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant's income, estimated debt-to-income ratio, and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratio. We generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 370: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Commercial: We offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. Our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower's financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions. We assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees, if any, and current market conditions. Although we generally retain commercial loans, we may syndicate positions for risk mitigation purposes, including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten. In addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to government-sponsored enterprises.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 371: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans Held for Investment Portfolio Composition\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale.

Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger-balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are one of the primary indicators of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, particularly in our credit card loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the exposure of the portfolio to regional economic conditions.\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions.\nTable 19 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loans held for investment portfolios as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 19: Credit Score Distribution Table 378: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Percentage of portfolio)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic credit card-Refreshed FICO scores:(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>660 or below\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Auto-At origination FICO scores:(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>621 - 660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>620 or below\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 379: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category.

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.\nTable 22: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest Table 387: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan category:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit card\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial banking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Geographic region:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 388: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Delinquency rates are calculated by dividing delinquency amounts by period-end loans held for investment for each specified loan category, including PCI loans as applicable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed properties, repossessed assets, and the net realizable value of certain partially charged off auto loans.

involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of these concessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged-off amount is reported as principal reduction. Impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment.\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction or a gross balance reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value.\nWe provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in Note 4-Loans.\u201d\nImpaired Loans\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger-balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans, which are accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred.\nTable 401: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpaired loans totaled $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The LCR Rule requires us to calculate our LCR daily and to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, our LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of our LCR. Our average LCR during the fourth quarter of 2018 exceeded the LCR requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See Part I-Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation\u201d for additional information.\nBorrowing Capacity\nWe maintain a shelf registration with the SEC that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust and a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $20 billion in securitized auto loans.\nIn addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks' ability to post collateral. As of December 31, 2018, we pledged both loans and securities to FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $19.3 billion, of which $9.5 billion was still available to us to borrow. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $415 million and $360 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. In addition, we have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, totaling $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFunding\nOur primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and brokered deposits, as well as federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See MD&A-Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis-Funding Sources Composition\u201d for additional information on our primary sources of funding.\nTable 414: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.\nPrimary Market Risk Exposures\nOur primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk and customer-related trading risk, both of which we believe are minimal after considering the impact of our associated risk management activities discussed below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nForeign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the operations of our international businesses in the U.K. and Canada. The largest foreign exchange exposure arising from these operations is the funding they are provided in the Great British pound ( GBP\u201d) and the Canadian dollar ( CAD\u201d), respectively. We also have foreign exchange exposure through our net equity investments in these operations and through the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows they generate.\nOur intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations result in translation risk exposure in our AOCI and capital ratios. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. We use foreign currency derivative contracts as net investment hedges\nTable 430: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nto manage our AOCI exposure. We apply hedge accounting to both our intercompany funding hedges and our net investment hedges, with the primary net investments subject to hedging denominated in GBP.\nWe measure our total exposure from non-dollar-denominated intercompany borrowings to our international businesses by regularly tracking the value of the loans made to our foreign operations and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contracts we use to hedge them. We apply a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these exposures to measure the impact to our consolidated statements of income from foreign exchange transaction risk. The intercompany borrowings to our international businesses were 756 million GBP and 741 million GBP as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 6.5 billion CAD and 6.4 billion CAD as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe measure our total exposure in non-dollar-denominated equity by regularly tracking the value of net equity invested in our foreign operations largely in the U.K. and Canada. Our measurement of net equity includes the impact of net investment hedges where applicable. We apply a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 1.6 billion GBP as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, and 1.2 billion CAD and 1.0 billion CAD as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAs a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.\nCustomer-Related Trading Risk\nWe offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to customers within our Commercial Banking business and offset the majority of these exposures through derivative transactions with other counterparties. These exposures are measured and monitored on a daily basis. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe our net exposure to customer-related trading risk is minimal.\nWe employ value-at-risk ( VaR\u201d) as the primary method to both measure and monitor the market risk in our customer-related trading activities. VaR is a statistical-based risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse market movements in a normal market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. We use internal models to produce a daily VaR measure of the market risk of all customer-related trading exposures.\nFor further information on our customer-related trading exposures, see Note 10-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\u201d\nMarket Risk Management\nWe employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities and mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions. Derivatives are the primary tools that we use for managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Use of derivatives is included in our current market risk management policies. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts increased to $212.5 billion as of December 31, 2018 from $196.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 primarily driven by an increase in our customer accommodation activities.\nMarket Risk Measurement\nWe have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in Economic Value of Equity.\u201d\nTable 431: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. As interest rates have increased in 2018, we have incorporated a 200 basis points decline scenario into our interest rate sensitivity analysis. We use this 200 basis points decrease as our largest magnitude declining interest rate scenario and in scenarios where a 200 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%.\nNet Interest Income Sensitivity\nThis sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points, -50 basis points, -100 basis points and -200 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. At the current level of interest rates, our net interest income remains largely unchanged in most scenarios and decreases in the -200 basis points scenario.\nEconomic Value of Equity\nOur economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points, -50 basis points, -100 basis points and -200 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.\nCalculating our economic value of equity and its sensitivity to interest rates requires projecting cash flows for assets, liabilities and derivative instruments and discounting those cash flows at the appropriate discount rates. Key assumptions in our economic value of equity calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions.\nOur current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases as interest rates increase indicating that the economic value of our assets and derivative positions is more sensitive to interest rate changes than our liabilities.\nTable 432: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 34: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis Table 433: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+50 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-50 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated impact on economic value of equity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+50 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-50 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-200 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions, the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks, as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.\nLimitations of Market Risk Measures\nThe interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.\nThere are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.\nTable 434: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td>

assets and metrics computed using these amounts, which include tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible assets, return on average TCE and TCE ratio. We consider these metrics to be key financial performance measures that management uses in assessing capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. While these non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, our measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d)\n \nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon management's current expectations and are subject to significant uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Please review Part I-Item 1. Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for more information on the forward-looking statements in this 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K ( this Report\u201d). Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those described in Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Report. Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 included in this Report.\n \nManagement monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity by focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth and credit quality metrics. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and accompanying notes. MD&A is organized in the following sections:\n\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK \nFinancial Highlights\nWe reported net income of $6.0 billion ($11.82 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $28.1 billion for 2018. In comparison, we reported net income of $2.0 billion ($3.49 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $27.2 billion for 2017, and $3.8 billion ($6.89 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $25.5 billion for 2016.\nOur common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 11.2% and 10.3% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See MD&A-Capital Management\u201d below for additional information.\nOn June 28, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of our common stock ( 2018 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d) beginning in the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. We completed the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program in the fourth quarter of 2018. See MD&A-Capital Management-Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases\u201d for additional information.\nBelow are additional highlights of our performance in 2018. These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of 2018 and 2017, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2018 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2017.\n 41 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \nTotal Company Performance\n \u2022 Earnings: Our net income increased by $4.0 billion to $6.0 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by: \n \u25e6 lower income tax provision largely due to elevated charges associated with the impacts of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a tax benefit related to a tax methodology change on rewards costs; \n \u25e6 lower provision for credit losses driven by allowance releases in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios largely due to improvements in credit trends; \n \u25e6 higher non-interest income largely due to the net gains from the sales of exited businesses including sale of our consumer home loan portfolio and an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume, partially offset by an impairment charge as a result of repositioning our investment securities portfolio; and \n \u25e6 higher net interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios and higher yields on interest-earning assets as a result of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense attributable to higher interest rates.  These drivers were partially offset by higher non-interest expense largely due to increased marketing expense and a legal reserve build.\n \u2022 Loans Held for Investment: \n \u25e6 Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $8.6 billion to $245.9 billion as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our commercial, auto and domestic credit card portfolios. \n \u25e6 Average loans held for investment decreased by $3.4 billion to $242.1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by the growth in our domestic credit card portfolio including loans obtained in the Cabela's acquisition, and growth in our auto loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate decreased by 15 basis points to 2.52% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by elevated charge-offs in our taxi medallion portfolio in 2017 within our Commercial Banking business.  Our 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 36 basis points to 3.84% as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the impact of lower loan balances from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio and higher delinquencies in our auto loan portfolio.\n \u2022 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $282 million to $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by allowance releases in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios largely due to improvements in credit trends.  The allowance coverage ratio remained substantially flat at 2.94% as of December 31, 2018 as allowance releases in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios were offset by lower loan balances largely due to the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio.\nBusiness Outlook\nWe discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time this Report was filed. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in Part I-Item 1. Business\u201d and Part II-Item 7. MD&A\u201d in this Report. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect:\n \u2022 any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; \n 42 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \n \u2022 the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or \n \u2022 any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made.  See Part I-Item 1. Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this Report and Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Report for factors that could materially influence our results.\nTotal Company Expectations\nWe expect that our full-year 2019 operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, will improve modestly, excluding the $225 million one-time Walmart launch and integration expenses.\nWhile efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long term, we continue to believe that we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains.\nWe believe we have sufficient capital and earnings to support growth, the Walmart portfolio acquisition, the phased-in impact of adopting CECL on January 1, 2020, as well as the potential for a meaningful capital distribution in the 2019 CCAR window.\nWe continue to believe increases in deposit costs and deposit product mix changes will have a negative impact on our net interest margin going forward.\nBusiness Segment Expectations\nDomestic Card: In our Domestic Card business, we expect to incur approximately $225 million in one-time expenses in 2019 to launch the new Walmart originations programs and integrate the acquired portfolio. We expect these costs will ramp up over the course of 2019.\nWe currently estimate the initial allowance build for the acquired Walmart portfolio will be approximately $120 million. The actual impact will depend on the amount and characteristics of the receivables as well as economic conditions and our loss forecasts at the acquisition date.\nConsumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we expect further increases in average deposit interest rate as product mix shift continues. Increasing competition for deposits will also put upward pressure on deposit rates.\nOver the longer-term, we continue to expect that the charge-off rate in our auto finance business will increase gradually.\n CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nThe section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2018 and 2017. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, MD&A-Business Segment Financial Performance.\u201d You should read this section together with our MD&A-Executive Summary and Business Outlook,\u201d where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n 43 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \nTable 1 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances below.\nTable 1: Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin \n__________\n (1) Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n (2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable- equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate (21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and 2016) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our Commercial banking loans totaled approximately $82 million, $129 million and $126 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with corresponding reductions to Other category. \n (3) Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting. In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. As a result, interest income and interest expense amounts shown above for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $2 million and $38 million, respectively, related to hedge ineffectiveness that would previously have been included in other non-interest income. \n 44 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \n \nNet interest income increased by $415 million to $22.9 billion in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, and higher yields as a result of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and the reduction in net interest income from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio.\nNet interest margin decreased by 10 basis points to 6.87% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher interest expense due to higher interest rates, partially offset by product mix changes and higher yields in our interest-earning assets.\nNet interest income increased by $1.6 billion to $22.5 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net interest margin increased by 19 basis points to 6.97% in 2017 compared to 2016. These increases were primarily driven by:\n \u2022 growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios; \n \u2022 higher yields as a result of higher interest rates; \n \u2022 partially offset by higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates, as well as growth and mix changes in our interest-bearing liabilities. \nTable 2 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to:\n \u2022 changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or \n \u2022 changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.  Table 2: Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income(1) \n__________\n (1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive. \n (2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable- equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate (21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and 2016) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. \n 45 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \nNon-Interest Income\nTable 3 displays the components of non-interest income for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Certain prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.\nTable 3: Non-Interest Income \nNon-interest income increased by $424 million to $5.2 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to:\n \u2022 the net gains from the sales of exited businesses including the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio; and \n \u2022 an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume.  These drivers are partially offset by an impairment charge as a result of repositioning our investment securities portfolio.\nNon-interest income increased by $149 million to $4.8 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by:\n \u2022 an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume; and \n \u2022 gains from the sale of investment securities as a result of portfolio repositioning. \nProvision for Credit Losses\nOur provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses, and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $5.9 billion, $7.6 billion and $6.5 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 25.6%, 33.6% and 30.9% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOur provision for credit losses decreased by $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by allowance releases in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios largely due to improvements in credit trends.\nOur provision for credit losses increased by $1.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by:\n \u2022 higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning; \n \u2022 higher charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio due to growth; and \n \u2022 partially offset by lower provision in our commercial banking loan portfolio primarily driven by stabilizing industry conditions impacting our oil and gas lending portfolio compared to adverse industry conditions in the prior year.  We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within MD&A-Credit Risk Profile,\u201d Note 4-Loans\u201d and Note 5-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.\u201d For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\n 46 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \nNon-Interest Expense\nTable 4 displays the components of non-interest expense for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 4: Non-Interest Expense ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

In comparison, we reported net income of $2.0 billion ($3.49 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $27.2 billion for 2017, and $3.8 billion ($6.89 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $25.5 billion for 2016.\nOur common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 11.2% and 10.3% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See MD&A-Capital Management\u201d below for additional information.\nOn June 28, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of our common stock ( 2018 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d) beginning in the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. We completed the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program in the fourth quarter of 2018. See MD&A-Capital Management-Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases\u201d for additional information.\nBelow are additional highlights of our performance in 2018. These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of 2018 and 2017, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2018 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2017.\n 41 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \nTotal Company Performance\n \u2022 Earnings: Our net income increased by $4.0 billion to $6.0 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by: \n \u25e6 lower income tax provision largely due to elevated charges associated with the impacts of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a tax benefit related to a tax methodology change on rewards costs; \n \u25e6 lower provision for credit losses driven by allowance releases in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios largely due to improvements in credit trends; \n \u25e6 higher non-interest income largely due to the net gains from the sales of exited businesses including sale of our consumer home loan portfolio and an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume, partially offset by an impairment charge as a result of repositioning our investment securities portfolio; and \n \u25e6 higher net interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios and higher yields on interest-earning assets as a result of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense attributable to higher interest rates.  These drivers were partially offset by higher non-interest expense largely due to increased marketing expense and a legal reserve build.\n \u2022 Loans Held for Investment: \n \u25e6 Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $8.6 billion to $245.9 billion as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our commercial, auto and domestic credit card portfolios. \n \u25e6 Average loans held for investment decreased by $3.4 billion to $242.1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by the growth in our domestic credit card portfolio including loans obtained in the Cabela's acquisition, and growth in our auto loan portfolio. \n \u2022 Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate decreased by 15 basis points to 2.52% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by elevated charge-offs in our taxi medallion portfolio in 2017 within our Commercial Banking business.  Our 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 36 basis points to 3.84% as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the impact of lower loan balances from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio and higher delinquencies in our auto loan portfolio.\n \u2022 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $282 million to $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by allowance releases in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios largely due to improvements in credit trends.  The allowance coverage ratio remained substantially flat at 2.94% as of December 31, 2018 as allowance releases in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios were offset by lower loan balances largely due to the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio.\nBusiness Outlook\nWe discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time this Report was filed. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in Part I-Item 1. Business\u201d and Part II-Item 7. MD&A\u201d in this Report. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect:\n \u2022 any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; \n 42 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \n \u2022 the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or \n \u2022 any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made.  See Part I-Item 1. Business-Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this Report and Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Report for factors that could materially influence our results.\nTotal Company Expectations\nWe expect that our full-year 2019 operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, will improve modestly, excluding the $225 million one-time Walmart launch and integration expenses.\nWhile efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long term, we continue to believe that we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains.\nWe believe we have sufficient capital and earnings to support growth, the Walmart portfolio acquisition, the phased-in impact of adopting CECL on January 1, 2020, as well as the potential for a meaningful capital distribution in the 2019 CCAR window.\nWe continue to believe increases in deposit costs and deposit product mix changes will have a negative impact on our net interest margin going forward.\nBusiness Segment Expectations\nDomestic Card: In our Domestic Card business, we expect to incur approximately $225 million in one-time expenses in 2019 to launch the new Walmart originations programs and integrate the acquired portfolio. We expect these costs will ramp up over the course of 2019.\nWe currently estimate the initial allowance build for the acquired Walmart portfolio will be approximately $120 million. The actual impact will depend on the amount and characteristics of the receivables as well as economic conditions and our loss forecasts at the acquisition date.\nConsumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we expect further increases in average deposit interest rate as product mix shift continues. Increasing competition for deposits will also put upward pressure on deposit rates.\nOver the longer-term, we continue to expect that the charge-off rate in our auto finance business will increase gradually.\n CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nThe section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2018 and 2017. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, MD&A-Business Segment Financial Performance.\u201d You should read this section together with our MD&A-Executive Summary and Business Outlook,\u201d where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n 43 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \nTable 1 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances below.\nTable 1: Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Table 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n (2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable- equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate (21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and 2016) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our Commercial banking loans totaled approximately $82 million, $129 million and $126 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with corresponding reductions to Other category. \n (3) Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting. In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. As a result, interest income and interest expense amounts shown above for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $2 million and $38 million, respectively, related to hedge ineffectiveness that would previously have been included in other non-interest income. \n 44 Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) \n \nNet interest income increased by $415 million to $22.9 billion in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, and higher yields as a result of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and the reduction in net interest income from the sale of our consumer home loan portfolio.\nNet interest margin decreased by 10 basis points to 6.87% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher interest expense due to higher interest rates, partially offset by product mix changes and higher yields in our interest-earning assets.\nNet interest income increased by $1.6 billion to $22.5 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net interest margin increased by 19 basis points to 6.97% in 2017 compared to 2016. These increases were primarily driven by:\n \u2022 growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios; \n \u2022 higher yields as a result of higher interest rates; \n \u2022 partially offset by higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates, as well as growth and mix changes in our interest-bearing liabilities. \nTable 2 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to:\n \u2022 changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or \n \u2022 changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.
