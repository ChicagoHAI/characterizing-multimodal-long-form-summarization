    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and exhibits included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Form 10-K may be considered forward-looking. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results, and also may include our belief regarding the effect of various legal proceedings, as set forth under \"Legal Proceedings\" in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K and in our subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including those factors discussed below under \"External Factors Impacting Our Business\" as well as the factors identified under \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K, as updated in our subsequent reports filed with the SEC. These reports are available at our Web site at www.piperjaffray.com and at the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). These non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments to exclude (1) revenues and expenses related to noncontrolling interests, (2) amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, (3) compensation and non-compensation expenses from acquisition-related agreements, (4) restructuring and acquisition integration costs, (5) goodwill impairment charges and (6) the impact from remeasuring deferred tax assets resulting from changes to the U.S. federal tax code. These adjustments affect the following financial measures: net revenues, compensation expenses, non-compensation expenses, income tax expense/(benefit), net income/(loss) applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies, earnings/(loss) per diluted common share, return on average common shareholders' equity, segment net revenues, segment operating expenses, segment pre-tax operating income/(loss) and segment pre-tax operating margin. Management believes that presenting these results and measures on an adjusted basis in conjunction with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures provides the most meaningful basis for comparison of its operating results across periods, and enhances the overall understanding of our current financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nExecutive Overview\nStrategic Growth Initiatives - Beginning in 2011, following the financial crisis, we implemented a strategic framework focused on achieving strong results across various markets conditions, sustainable growth and predictability in earnings, as well as expanding operating margin. Our plan focused on increasing the contributions from our higher margin activities (i.e., advisory services and public finance), diversifying the business, managing operating costs diligently, and investing for growth. Through strong execution on these strategic initiatives we have produced a substantial increase in net revenues and remixed the business to higher quality earnings. These favorable attributes have generated greater earnings and enabled us to return capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends, which we initiated in the first quarter of 2017 and subsequently increased going into 2018. Our investments in the business are discussed below.\nOverview of Operations - Our operations are principally engaged in providing investment banking, institutional brokerage, asset management and related financial services to corporations, private equity groups, public entities, non-profit entities and institutional investors in the United States and Europe. We operate through two reportable business segments:\nCapital Markets - The Capital Markets segment provides investment banking services and institutional sales, trading and research services. Investment banking services include management of and participation in underwritings, financial advisory services and public finance activities. Revenues are generated through the receipt of advisory and financing fees. Institutional sales, trading and research services focus on the trading of equity and fixed income products with institutions, government and non-profit entities. Revenues are generated through commissions and sales credits earned on equity and fixed income institutional sales activities, net interest revenues on trading securities held in inventory, and profits and losses from trading these securities. Also, we generate revenue through strategic trading and investing activities, which focus on investments in municipal bonds and U.S. government agency securities. In order to invest firm capital and to manage capital from outside investors, we have created alternative asset management funds in merchant banking that involve equity or debt investments in late stage private companies; senior living, which provides financing to U.S. senior living facilities; and energy, whose principal activity is to invest in oil and gas services companies headquartered in Europe. We receive management and performance fees for managing these funds.\nWe have executed on our strategic growth initiatives through investments in the business, primarily by expanding into new industry sectors within equity investment banking and equity institutional brokerage, and the expansion of our fixed income middle market sales platform. The following is a summary of these activities.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As part of our strategy to expand our equity investment banking business into the energy sector and grow our advisory\n</td> </tr>\n</table> business, on February 26, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Simmons & Company International (\"Simmons\"), an employee-owned investment bank and broker dealer focused on the energy industry. For more information on our acquisition of Simmons, see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In 2015, we built upon our expansion into the financial institutions sector by acquiring the assets of River Branch Holdings LLC (\"River Branch\"), an equity investment banking boutique focused on the financial institutions sector. Also in 2015, we completed the acquisition of BMO Capital Markets GKST Inc. (\"BMO GKST\"), a municipal bond sales, trading and origination business of BMO Financial Corp.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Over the past several years, we have added and strengthened sub-sectors across our industry groups. In equity investment banking, we added healthy living in our consumer sector and strengthened our healthcare sector with biotech and healthcare information technology practices. In addition, we broadened our specialty practices in public finance with additions in senior living and charter schools.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have investment commitments related to affiliated entities which will make direct or indirect debt investments in companies. In 2018, we anticipate that we will begin to underwrite and syndicate loans through these entities.\nAsset Management - The Asset Management segment, which provides traditional asset management services, manages investments in master limited partnerships (\"MLPs\") and energy infrastructure securities focused on the energy sector, and manages assets in domestic and global equity markets. Revenues are generated in the form of management and performance fees. Revenues are also generated through investments in the partnerships and funds that we manage.\nAn explicit element of our strategy in asset management has been to diversify our product offerings through the addition of high quality investment teams. In addition to our core MLP and value equity products, we have added teams specializing in domestic growth equity, global equity, and quantitative strategies, allowing us to leverage the infrastructure of our existing platform.\nIn 2017, our Asset Management segment experienced declining profitability due to decreases in revenues from reduced AUM and higher operating expenses from the addition of new investment teams. In the third quarter of 2017, we identified goodwill impairment indicators necessitating a full impairment testing of goodwill. The interim impairment testing related to our Asset Management segment goodwill resulted in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $114.4 million. For more information on our goodwill impairment testing, please refer to the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" section.\nIn 2016, an extended cycle of investors favoring passive investment vehicles over active management, combined with certain products having investment performance below their benchmarks, reduced management fees for the asset management business and caused a corresponding decline in profitability. Lower average AUM for our MLP strategies, driven by a decline in MLP valuations, also resulted in decreased management fees and profitability. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing, including the goodwill associated with our Asset Management segment, which resulted in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $82.9 million.\nFinancial Highlights\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Inc/(Dec)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>874,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>747,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>617,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-compensation expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,952\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss per diluted common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.07\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>869,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>736,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted compensation and benefits expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>562,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted non-compensation expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings per diluted common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M - Not meaningful\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net revenues increased 17.1 percent compared to 2016.

Overall market conditions are a product of many factors, which are beyond our control, often unpredictable and at times inherently volatile. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions, the relative level of volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, changes in interest rates and credit spreads (especially rapid and extreme changes), overall market liquidity, the level and shape of various yield curves, the volume and value of trading in securities, overall equity valuations, and the demand for active asset management services.\nFactors that differentiate our business within the financial services industry also may affect our financial results. For example, our capital markets business focuses on specific industry sectors while serving principally middle-market clientele. If the business environment for our focus sectors is impacted adversely, our business and results of operations could reflect these impacts. In addition, our business, with its specific areas of focus and investment, may not track overall market trends. Given the variability of the capital markets and securities businesses, our earnings may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and results for any individual period should not be considered indicative of future results.\nOutlook for 2018\nWe expect the U.S. economy to continue to grow at a moderate pace in 2018. The recently passed tax reform legislation, increased fiscal spending, actions to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses, and broad growth across most major global economies should be supportive to economic growth in the U.S. Conversely, geopolitical risks or economic instability internationally may pose consequences for the global economy and inject periods of heightened volatility into the U.S. equity and debt markets.\nWe believe that U.S. monetary policy could possibly have a material impact on the economy in 2018. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates three times in 2017 on the expectation of stronger economic growth despite muted signs of inflation. Long-term interest rates, however, have not moved in step with increases in short-term interest rates resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. We anticipate that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to pursue a gradual and steady path to rate normalization, particularly if there is acceleration in the pace of inflation. Higher interest rates could trigger a sell-off in equities which would likely adversely impact our equity capital raising and advisory businesses. Further, if long-term interest rates prove resistant to a tightening in monetary policy, we could experience an extended period of a flat, or even an inverse, yield curve, which could adversely impact our fixed income sales and trading business. In addition, exogenous conditions may trigger episodes of volatility with respect to interest rates. A volatile interest rate environment could manifest itself in changes to the yield curve or relative spreads which may have a mixed impact on certain of our businesses.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\"), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, will have a significant impact on the federal tax code, including a significant corporate federal rate reduction and tax treatment which would facilitate the repatriation of earnings from overseas profits. The lower corporate tax rate will result in additional earnings, which we will use to invest in our business and to return capital to our shareholders through dividends. We will also continue to look for opportunistic investments that are in line with our strategy. Although the full impact of the Tax Reform Act on our businesses is not yet known, we would anticipate that certain sectors of our businesses may be affected more than others. We expect that our public finance operations will be adversely impacted as the repeal of tax-exempt advance refunding bonds through the Tax Reform Act will result in a decline in municipal issuance volume in the market. The impact on our equity investment banking businesses is expected to be favorable, albeit at a moderate level. The Tax Reform Act is not expected to have a significant impact on our institutional brokerage or asset management businesses. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of this legislation on our businesses.\nWe expect conditions in the equity markets to remain conducive to our advisory and equity capital raising activities in 2018. While lower volatility benefits our capital raising business, it has the inverse effect on our equity sales and trading business. We have experienced heightened volatility in early 2018. If we experience sustained bouts of higher volatility or a material market correction, our equity brokerage business may benefit while our advisory and equity capital raising businesses may suffer. We believe our advisory services business will continue to perform well in 2018 on the strength of our market position, long-term investments, diversity in our practice and readily available capital. As noted above, economic instability arising from a significant geopolitical event, for example, or an adverse market reaction to monetary tightening would likely be detrimental to both our equity capital raising and advisory businesses. Advisory services revenues for any given quarter are impacted by the timing and size of the deals closing, which can result in fluctuations in revenues period over period.\nWe expect that secular challenges to our equity brokerage business, including the shift from active to passive managers, will persist in 2018. These challenges may be exacerbated by the implementation of MiFID II, a European regulation which may be adopted by some of our U.S. clients. This regulation, which governs how buyside clients (asset managers) pay for services performed by brokerage businesses, may lead to revenue declines for U.S brokerage businesses, and we would not be immune from this impact.\nWe would expect the low interest rate environment and flat yield curve to persist in 2018. This would continue to subdue customer flow activity for our fixed income institutional brokerage business. While higher interest rates across the yield curve would be favorable to this business, the move to higher rates could adversely impact our public finance business in the short-term as the level of refunding activity eases while greater economic growth has not yet spurred a ramp in new money issuance volumes. Irrespective of the interest rate levels, we believe that municipal debt underwriting activity will be down meaningfully in 2018 compared to 2017 as some issuances were accelerated to the end of 2017 due to pending changes from the tax reform legislation, and also due to a lower level of refunding activity.\nAs economic growth continues we would expect rising market valuations, which would have a positive impact on our asset management business. However, market valuations may be negatively impacted by significant declines and volatility in the financial markets, as experienced in early 2018. We would expect that active asset managers, ourselves included, will remain under pressure to create alpha for their clients and to maintain or grow AUM.\nResults of Operations\nFinancial Summary\nThe

applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies of $61.9 million, driven by a $70.8 million, net of tax, goodwill impairment charge and a $54.2 million tax charge for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of the lower enacted federal corporate tax rate. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $874.9 million, a 17.1 percent increase compared to $747.3 million in the year-ago period. In 2017, investment banking revenues increased 29.3 percent to $633.8 million, compared with $490.3 million in 2016, driven by strong advisory services revenues. The advisory services business has been a strategic focus for us, and these results reflect significant market share gains. Also, equity financing revenues increased as the market environment for equity capital raising improved significantly after challenging market conditions in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by lower debt financing revenues, which declined compared to a strong year-ago period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, institutional brokerage revenues were $154.6 million, down 4.1 percent compared with $161.2 million in 2016, due to lower equity and fixed income institutional brokerage revenues. Asset management fees were $56.8 million in 2017, down 6.3 percent compared with $60.7 million in 2016, as lower management fees from our equity product offerings were partially offset by higher management fees from MLP product offerings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased to $11.7 million, compared with $10.5 million in 2016. In 2017, investment income was $18.0 million, compared with $24.6 million in 2016, due to lower gains on our investment and the noncontrolling interests in the merchant banking fund that we manage. Non-interest expenses were $904.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 16.2 percent compared to $778.2 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher compensation expenses from increased revenues, as well as higher acquisition-related compensation costs. Also, we incurred a $114.4 million goodwill impairment charge in 2017, compared to a $82.9 million goodwill impairment charge in the prior year. Incremental back office conversion costs in the current year were more than offset by lower restructuring costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net loss applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies of $22.0 million, driven by a $50.9 million, net of tax, goodwill impairment charge. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $747.3 million, a 11.1 percent increase compared to $672.9 million in 2015. In 2016, investment banking revenues increased 18.4 percent to $490.3 million, compared with $414.1 million in 2015, driven by strong advisory services and debt financing revenues which reflected our investments and focus to grow these businesses. These increases were partially offset by lower equity financing revenues, as our equity capital raising business experienced challenging market conditions for most of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, institutional brokerage revenues were $161.2 million, up 4.1 percent compared with $154.9 million in 2015, due to higher equity institutional brokerage revenues. Asset management fees were $60.7 million in 2016, compared with $75.0 million in 2015, due to lower management fees from our equity and MLP product offerings. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net interest income decreased to $10.5 million, compared with $18.2 million in 2015. The decrease primarily resulted from the liquidation of our municipal bond fund with outside investors in the second half of 2015, and additional interest expense on our senior notes. In addition, we had lower interest income earned on mortgage-backed securities as a result of lower inventory balances. In 2016, investment income was $24.6 million, compared with $10.7 million in 2015. We recorded losses on our investments of firm capital in our MLP strategies in 2015. Non-interest expenses were $778.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 32.7 percent compared to $586.5 million in 2015. The increase was due to an $82.9 million goodwill impairment charge, as well as higher compensation expense driven by increased revenues and higher expenses resulting from our acquisitions and business expansion. Partially offsetting this increase was lower legal reserves associated with a $9.8 million legal settlement in 2015.\nNew Revenue Recognition Guidance\nAs discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we will adopt new revenue recognition guidance effective as of January 1, 2018. The current broker dealer industry treatment of netting deal expenses with investment banking revenues will change under the new guidance. As a result of adopting the new guidance, we will generally present deal expenses on a gross basis under non-interest expenses on the consolidated statements of operations, rather than the current presentation of netting deal expenses incurred for completed investment banking deals within revenues. This change will not impact earnings, however, we will report higher investment banking revenues and higher non-compensation expenses. Based upon prior years' experience, we would expect $20 million to $25 million of annual deal-related costs to be reported as non-compensation expenses upon adoption of the new guidance. The amount of deal-related costs in 2018 will principally be dependent on the level of deal activity and may vary from quarter to quarter as the collection of deal-related costs typically coincides with the closing of a transaction. In addition, we expect to defer the recognition of performance fees on our merchant banking, energy and senior living alternative asset management funds until such fees are no longer subject to reversal, which will cause a delay in the recognition of these fees as revenue. We anticipate that our current methods of recognizing investment banking revenues will not be significantly impacted by the new guidance.\nConsolidated Non-Interest Expenses\nCompensation and Benefits - Compensation and benefits expenses, which are the largest component of our expenses, include salaries, incentive compensation, benefits, stock-based compensation, employment taxes, income associated with the forfeiture of stock-based compensation and other employee-related costs. A portion of compensation expense is comprised of variable incentive arrangements, including discretionary incentive compensation, the amount of which fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity, increasing with higher revenues and operating profits. Other compensation costs, primarily base salaries and benefits, are more fixed in nature. The timing of incentive compensation payments, which generally occur in February, has a greater impact on our cash position and liquidity than is reflected on our consolidated statements of operations.We have granted restricted stock with service conditions as a component of our acquisition deal consideration, which is amortized to compensation expense over the service period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, compensation and benefits expenses increased 21.0 percent to $617.6 million from $510.6 million in 2016. Compensation expenses increased due to higher revenues as well as higher acquisition-related compensation costs, which were driven by incremental compensation expenses related to a Simmons performance award plan implemented at the time of acquisition. Our compensation costs related to this performance plan increased to $27.0 million in 2017, compared to $4.3 million in 2016, as the Simmons business outperformed our projections in 2017 due to a recovery in the energy markets and strong execution of investment banking transactions. As a result, we have refined our future projections related to this business and the performance award plan. Compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of net revenues was 70.6 percent in 2017, compared with 68.3 percent in 2016. The higher compensation expense ratio was attributable to increased acquisition-related compensation, and the impact of defined retirement provisions for performance share units to be granted in February 2018, which resulted in recognition of additional compensation expense. Absent a significant change in our business or market conditions impacting the energy sector, the impact of acquisition-related costs will continue to elevate this rate in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, compensation and benefits expenses increased 21.1 percent to $510.6 million from $421.7 million in 2015, due to higher revenues as well as higher acquisition-related compensation costs primarily resulting from the Simmons acquisition completed in February 2016. Compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of net revenues was 68.3 percent in 2016, compared with 62.7 percent in 2015. The higher compensation expense ratio was attributable to increased acquisition-related compensation.\nOutside Services - Outside services expenses include securities processing expenses, outsourced technology functions, outside legal fees, fund expenses associated with our consolidated alternative asset management funds and other professional fees. Outside services expenses decreased 3.3 percent to $38.0 million in 2017, compared with $39.3 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Excluding the portion of expenses from non-controlled equity interests in our consolidated alternative asset management funds, outside services expenses were essentially flat.\nOutside services expenses increased 8.5 percent to $39.3 million in 2016, compared with $36.2 million in 2015. Excluding the portion of expenses from non-controlled equity interests in our consolidated alternative asset management funds, outside services expenses increased 9.2 percent due primarily to higher professional fees, as well as incremental expenses related to our acquisitions.\nOccupancy and Equipment - For the year ended December 31, 2017, occupancy and equipment expenses decreased 3.9 percent to $33.5 million, compared with $34.8 million in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, occupancy and equipment expenses increased 23.0 percent to $34.8 million, compared with $28.3 million in 2015. The increase was primarily the result of incremental occupancy expenses from our acquisitions of Simmons, River Branch and BMO GKST.\nCommunications - Communication expenses include costs for telecommunication and data communication, primarily consisting of expenses for obtaining third party market data information. For the year ended December 31, 2017, communication expenses were $29.9 million, up slightly compared with 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, communication expenses increased 24.7 percent to $29.6 million, compared with $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase resulted from higher market data service expenses due to the additional headcount associated with our acquisition of Simmons, and also reflected a full year of incremental expenses associated with our acquisitions of River Branch and BMO GKST.\nMarketing and Business Development - Marketing and business development expenses include travel and entertainment costs, advertising and third party marketing fees. In 2017, marketing and business development expenses were $31.3 million, compared with $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn 2016, marketing and business development expenses were $30.4 million, compared with $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as increased travel expenses were offset by a decline in third party marketing fees.\nTrade Execution and Clearance - For the year ended December 31, 2017, trade execution and clearance expenses increased to $8.2 million, compared with $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, trade execution and clearance expenses were $7.7 million, down slightly compared with 2015.\nRestructuring and Integration Costs - For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded restructuring and acquisition integration costs of $10.2 million, primarily related to our acquisition of Simmons. The expenses consisted of $6.6 million of severance, benefits and outplacement costs, $1.3 million of vacated redundant leased office space, $1.3 million of transaction costs, and $1.0 million of contract termination costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded restructuring and integration costs of $10.7 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of River Branch and BMO GKST. The expenses consisted of $8.8 million of severance, benefits and outplacement costs, $1.4 million of transaction costs, and $0.5 million of contract termination costs.\nGoodwill Impairment - During the third quarter of 2017, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test, which resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $114.4 million related to our asset management reporting unit.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing, which resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $82.9 million related to our asset management reporting unit.\nIntangible Asset Amortization - Intangible asset amortization includes the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets consisting of customer relationships and the Simmons trade name. For the year ended December 31, 2017, intangible asset amortization was $15.4 million, compared with $21.2 million in the corresponding period of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, intangible asset amortization was $21.2 million, compared with $7.7 million in the corresponding period of 2015. The increase reflects incremental intangible asset amortization related to the acquisition of Simmons, and a full year of intangible asset amortization related to the 2015 acquisitions of River Branch and BMO GKST.\nBack Office Conversion Costs - In 2017, we migrated to a fully disclosed clearing model and are no longer self clearing. Back office conversion costs include costs incurred to transition to a fully disclosed clearing model, such as contract termination fees, vendor migration fees, professional fees, and severance benefits for impacted personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred back office conversion costs of $3.9 million, compared with $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Operating Expenses - Other operating expenses include insurance costs, license and registration fees, expenses related to our charitable giving program and litigation-related expenses, which consist of the amounts we reserve and/or pay out related to legal and regulatory matters. Other operating expenses increased to $12.1 million in 2017, compared with $10.9 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher expense related to our charitable giving program driven by our increased profitability on a non-GAAP basis.\nOther operating expenses decreased to $10.9 million in 2016, compared with $20.4 million in 2015. Legal reserves were higher in 2015 due to a $9.8 million charge resulting from settlement of a legal matter.\nIncome Taxes - For the year ended December 31, 2017, our provision for income taxes was $30.2 million, which includes a non-cash tax charge of $54.2 million for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets arising from the passing of the Tax Reform Act and the lower enacted federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent. As a result of the lower enacted federal tax rate, we anticipate our effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests and the impact from stock-based compensation award vestings, to be approximately 25 percent to 27 percent, beginning in 2018. Excluding this charge, our provision from income taxes in 2017 was a benefit of $23.9 million as a result of pre-tax losses related to the $114.4 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $9.2 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards vesting\nat values greater than the grant price. As discussed in Note 3, \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Other Guidance\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, effective as of January 1, 2017, new accounting guidance requires us to recognize the income tax effects of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest, rather than as additional paid-in capital. The amount recognized in the income statement in future periods may vary depending upon, among other things, the number of restricted shares vesting and their change in value since the grant date. We would expect that the impact of this guidance will be more meaningful in the first half of each year as the majority of our restricted stock vestings related to our employees' incentive compensation occurs in February.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our benefit for income taxes was $17.1 million, equating to an effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, of 43.8 percent. The higher effective tax rate was due to the benefit from tax-exempt municipal interest income during a period with pre-tax losses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our provision for income taxes was $27.9 million, equating to an effective rate, excluding noncontrolling interests, of 34.9 percent.\nSegment Performance\nWe measure financial performance by business segment. Our two reportable segments are Capital Markets and Asset Management. We determined these segments based upon the nature of the financial products and services provided to customers and our management organization. Segment pre-tax operating income/(loss) and segment pre-tax operating margin are used to evaluate and measure segment performance by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance in relation to our competitors. Revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective segment are included in determining segment operating results. Revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are allocated based upon our allocation methodologies, generally based on each segment's respective net revenues, use of shared resources, headcount or other relevant measures.\nThroughout this section, we have presented segment results on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management believes that presenting adjusted segment pre-tax operating income and adjusted segment pre-tax operating margin in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures provides a more meaningful basis for comparison of its operating results and underlying trends between periods, and enhances the overall understanding of our current financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP segment results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the segment results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted segment pre-tax operating income and adjusted segment pre-tax operating margin exclude (1) revenues and expenses related to noncontrolling interests, (2) amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, (3) compensation and non-compensation expenses from acquisition-related agreements, (4) restructuring and acquisition integration costs and (5) goodwill impairment charges. For U.S. GAAP purposes, these items are included in each of their respective line items on the consolidated statements of operations.\nAdjusted segment pre-tax operating income and adjusted segment pre-tax operating margin present the segments' results of operations excluding the impact resulting from the consolidation of noncontrolling interests in alternative asset management funds and private equity investment vehicles. Consolidation of these funds results in the inclusion of the proportionate share of the income or loss attributable to the equity interests in consolidated funds that are not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to us (i.e. noncontrolling interests). This proportionate share is reflected in net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, and has no effect on the overall financial performance of the segments, as ultimately, this income or loss is not income or loss for the segments themselves. Included in adjusted segment pre-tax operating income and adjusted segment pre-tax operating margin is the actual proportionate share of the income or loss attributable to us as an investor in such funds.\nAdjusted segment pre-tax operating income and adjusted segment pre-tax operating margin also exclude amortization of intangible assets and compensation and non-compensation expenses from acquisition-related agreements. These amounts are excluded on a non-GAAP basis as they represent expenses specifically related to acquisitions that will eventually be fully amortized and therefore not part of our on-going operations. The restructuring and integration costs excluded from adjusted segment pre-tax operating income and adjusted segment pre-tax operating margin represent charges that resulted from severance benefits, vacating redundant leased office space and contract termination costs. Restructuring and integration costs are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures as they generally relate to an acquisition or a specific event and excluding these amounts provides a better understanding of our core non-compensation expenses. Management believes that presenting adjusted segment pre-tax operating income and\nadjusted segment pre-tax operating margin excluding the acquisition-related amounts and restructuring and integration costs provides clarity on the financial results generated by the core operating components of our business. The non-cash goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2017 and 2016 relate to the asset management reporting unit.\nCapital Markets\nThe following table sets forth the Capital Markets adjusted segment financial results and adjustments necessary to reconcile to our consolidated U.S. GAAP pre-tax operating income and pre-tax operating margin for the periods presented:\nTable 48:

year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $692.3 million in the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Capital Markets adjusted net revenues were $817.1 million compared with $681.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The variance explanations for net revenues and adjusted net revenues are consistent on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nInvestment banking revenues comprise all of the revenues generated through equity and debt financing and advisory services activities, which include mergers and acquisitions, equity private placements, debt and restructuring advisory, and municipal financial advisory transactions. To assess the profitability of investment banking, we aggregate investment banking fees with the net interest income or expense associated with these activities.\nIn 2017, investment banking revenues increased 29.5 percent to $635.7 million compared with $490.8 million in the corresponding period of the prior year as strong advisory services and equity financing revenues were partially offset by lower debt financing revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, advisory services revenues increased 45.5 percent to $443.3 million, compared with $304.7 million in 2016. The increase reflects our long-term efforts to invest in and grow the advisory services business and the breadth of our platform. Revenue growth in advisory services also reflects market share gains, supplemented by constructive markets. We completed 163 transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of $34.3 billion in 2017, compared with 150 transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of $22.3 billion in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, equity financing revenues were $99.0 million, up 39.1 percent compared with $71.2 million in the prior-year period, due to more completed transactions and higher revenue per transaction in an improved market environment. Market conditions, driven by increased valuations and low volatility, were conducive for equity capital raising in 2017. During 2017, we completed 84 equity financings, raising $17.1 billion for our clients, compared with 68 equity financings, raising $13.7 billion for our clients in the year-ago period. Debt financing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $93.4 million, a decrease of 18.8 percent compared with $115.0 million in the year-ago period. Despite an increase in municipal issuance volume at the end of 2017 as issuers accelerated financings before the implementation of federal tax law changes in 2018, public finance revenues declined compared to a very strong 2016. Refunding activity decreased compared to the prior-year period, and was only partially offset by an increase in new money issuance volumes in 2017. During 2017, we completed 622 negotiated municipal issues with a total par value of $15.3 billion, compared with 718 negotiated municipal issues with a total par value of $16.7 billion during the prior-year period.\nInstitutional sales and trading revenues comprise all of the revenues generated through trading activities, which consist of facilitating customer trades, executing competitive municipal underwritings and our strategic trading activities in municipal bonds and U.S. government agency securities. To assess the profitability of institutional brokerage activities, we aggregate institutional brokerage revenues with the net interest income or expense associated with financing, economically hedging and holding long or short inventory positions. Our results may vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in trading margins, trading gains and losses, net interest spreads, trading volumes and the timing of transactions based on market opportunities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, institutional brokerage revenues decreased 4.6 percent to $171.2 million, compared with $179.5 million in the prior-year period, due to lower equity and fixed income institutional brokerage revenues. Equity institutional brokerage revenues were $81.7 million in 2017, down 7.1 percent compared with $88.0 million in 2016, as historically low levels of volatility reduced client trading volumes during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, fixed income institutional brokerage revenues were $89.5 million, down 2.2 percent compared with $91.5 million in the prior-year period. Customer flow activity remained light for most of 2017 due to the low interest rates and flat yield curve.\nManagement and performance fees include the fees generated from our merchant banking, energy and senior living funds with outside investors. For the year ended December 31, 2017, management and performance fees were $5.6 million, compared with $6.4 million in the prior-year period, due primarily to lower performance fees from our merchant banking fund. Upon adopting new revenue recognition guidance effective as of January 1, 2018, we expect to defer the recognition of performance fees on our merchant banking, energy and senior living funds until such fees are no longer subject to reversal, which will cause a delay in the recognition of these fees as revenue.\nInvestment income includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, in our merchant banking, energy and senior living funds, and other firm investments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, investment income was $17.6 million, compared to $24.8 million in 2016. In 2017, we recorded lower gains in our merchant banking and senior living funds, which were partially offset by higher gains on our other firm investments. Excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests, adjusted investment income was $12.3 million in 2017.\nLong-term financing expenses primarily represent interest recorded on our senior notes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, long-term financing expenses decreased to $7.7 million, compared to $9.1 million in the prior-year period. We repaid the $50 million of Class A senior notes upon maturity on May 31, 2017.\nCapital Markets segment pre-tax operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to 10.2 percent, compared with 6.7 percent for 2016. The increased pre-tax operating margin was due to a lower non-compensation ratio driven by higher revenues and lower levels of restructuring costs, which was partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs. In the year-ago period, we recorded $10.2 million of restructuring and integration costs primarily related to the acquisition of Simmons. Adjusted segment pre-tax operating margin of 18.0 percent in 2017 was an increase from the 14.7 percent operating margin recorded in 2016 due to operating leverage as a result of higher revenues. Adjusted net revenues increased 19.9 percent in 2017 and adjusted operating expenses increased 15.3 percent compared to 2016, reflecting operating leverage in the business.\nThe following table sets forth the Capital Markets adjusted segment financial results and adjustments necessary to reconcile to our consolidated U.S. GAAP pre-tax operating income and pre-tax operating margin for the periods

year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $609.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Capital Markets adjusted net revenues were $681.2 million compared with $599.5 million in the prior year. The variance explanations for net revenues and adjusted net revenues are consistent on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nIn 2016, investment banking revenues increased 18.3 percent to $490.8 million compared with $414.8 million in the prior year, as strong advisory services and debt financing revenues were partially offset by lower equity financing revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, advisory services revenues increased to $304.7 million, compared with $209.2 million in 2015. The increase reflects our long-term effort to grow our advisory services business, including expansion into the energy and financial institutions sectors. Our revenues increased more than 45 percent compared to the prior year while market-wide mergers and acquisitions activity declined, which reflects meaningful market share gains. Our debt advisory group also contributed to the strong results. We completed 150 transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of $22.3 billion during 2016, compared with 82 transactions with an aggregate enterprise value of $23.0 billion in 2015. Debt financing revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $115.0 million, up 26.1 percent compared with $91.2 million in the prior year, due to higher public finance revenues. Our public finance business benefited from increased new money issuance volumes and refunding activity, as well as market share gains attributable to our geographic and sector expansion. In 2016, our par value from negotiated debt issuances increased 17.2 percent, compared to 10.5 percent for the industry. During 2016, we completed 718 negotiated municipal issues with a total par value of $16.7 billion, compared with 707 negotiated municipal issues with a total par value of $14.3 billion during 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, equity financing revenues were $71.2 million, down 37.8 percent compared with $114.5 million in 2015, due to fewer completed transactions and lower revenue per transaction. The equity capital raising business experienced challenging market conditions for most of 2016. The total available fee pool in the sub-$2 billion market decreased 33 percent in 2016. Contributions from our expansion into the energy and financial institutions sectors partially offset the impact of the significant decrease in capital raising. During 2016, we completed 68 equity financings, raising $13.7 billion for our clients, compared with 95 equity financings, raising $17.4 billion for our clients in 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, institutional brokerage revenues increased 3.8 percent to $179.5 million, compared with $172.9 million in 2015, as higher equity institutional brokerage revenues were partially offset by lower fixed income institutional brokerage revenues. Equity institutional brokerage revenues were $88.0 million in 2016, up 12.0 percent compared with $78.6 million in 2015. The increase reflects our expansion into the energy and financial institutions sectors and expanded research capabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, fixed income institutional brokerage revenues were $91.5 million, down 3.0 percent compared with $94.3 million in the prior year. The addition of BMO GKST in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted in gains to our customer flow business in 2016, which were offset by lower trading gains from fewer trading opportunities. Challenging market conditions at various times during 2016 negatively impacted our trading opportunities, which reduced our revenues. Credit spreads were volatile in the first quarter of 2016, and the municipal market, in which we have a meaningful presence, was volatile in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, management and performance fees were $6.4 million, up 37.1 percent compared with $4.6 million in 2015, due to incremental management fees generated from two energy funds, which we acquired with the Simmons acquisition, as well as higher performance fees from our merchant banking fund. These increases were offset by lower management fees from a municipal bond fund with outside investors, which we closed in the third quarter of 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, investment income was $24.8 million, compared to $24.5 million in 2015. In 2016, higher gains on the senior living fund that we manage, as well as higher gains on our firm investments, were offset by lower gains in our merchant banking fund. Excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests, adjusted investment income was $14.7 million in 2016.\nIn 2016, long-term financing expenses increased to $9.1 million, compared to $7.5 million in the prior year, as we increased the amount of outstanding principal on our senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 from $125 million to $175 million.\nCapital Markets segment pre-tax operating margin for 2016 decreased to 6.7 percent, compared with 12.9 percent for 2015, due to higher acquisition-related costs. Adjusted segment pre-tax operating margin of 14.7 percent for 2016 was consistent with 2015. In 2016, a decrease in our non-compensation ratio was offset by a higher compensation ratio due to our mix of business.\nAsset Management\nThe following table sets forth the Asset Management segment

comprise the revenues generated from management and investment advisory services performed for separately managed accounts, registered funds and partnerships. Client asset inflows and outflows and investment performance have a direct effect on management and performance fee revenues. Management fees are generally based on the level of assets under management (\"AUM\") measured monthly or quarterly, and an increase or reduction in AUM, due to market price fluctuations or net client asset flows, will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees. Fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed. Performance fees are earned when the investment return on AUM exceeds certain benchmark targets or other performance targets over a specified measurement period. The level of performance fees earned can vary significantly from period to period and these fees may not necessarily be correlated to changes in total AUM. The majority of performance fees, if earned, are generally recorded in the fourth quarter of the applicable year or upon withdrawal of client assets. At December 31, 2017, approximately five percent of our AUM was eligible to earn performance fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, management fees were $51.3 million, a decrease of 4.6 percent, compared with $53.7 million in the prior-year period, as lower management fees from our equity product offerings were partially offset by higher management fees from our MLP product offerings. In 2017, management fees related to our equity strategies were $23.6 million, down 16.1 percent compared to $28.2 million in 2016. The decrease was driven by a lower average effective revenue yield which resulted from changes in our product mix, as well as lower average AUM due to net client outflows. The average effective yield (total management fees as a percentage of our average month-end AUM) for our equity strategies was 62 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 71 basis points for the prior-year period. Management fees from our MLP strategies increased 8.1 percent in 2017 to $27.6 million compared with $25.6 million in 2016, due to a higher average effective revenue yield and a slightly higher average AUM. The average effective yield for our MLP strategies was 65 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 62 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe performance fees of $0.6 million recorded in 2016 resulted from certain funds exceeding their performance targets over a specified measurement period.\nInvestment income includes gains and losses from our investments in registered funds and private funds or partnerships that we manage. In 2017, we recorded investment income of $1.2 million, compared with $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe negative pre-tax operating margin in 2017 and 2016 was driven by non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $114.4 million and $82.9 million, respectively. Excluding investment income on firm capital invested in our strategies, adjusted operating margin declined from 19.3 percent in 2016 to 9.6 percent in 2017. The decrease was due to negative operating leverage in the business.\nThe following table sets forth the Asset Management segment financial results and adjustments necessary to reconcile to our

23.4 percent, compared with $70.2 million in 2015, due to decreased management fees from both our equity and MLP product offerings. In 2016, management fees related to our equity strategies were $28.2 million, down 26.4 percent compared to 2015, driven by lower AUM from net client outflows in our value equity products amid tough market trends for active asset managers and underperformance in certain of our strategies. Management fees from our MLP strategies decreased 19.9 percent in 2016 to $25.6 million, compared with $31.9 million in 2015. The decline in management fees resulted from lower average AUM, driven by a decline in MLP valuations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, performance fees were $0.6 million, compared to $0.2 million in 2015. The performance fees recorded in 2016 and 2015 resulted from certain funds exceeding their performance targets over a specified measurement period.\nIn 2016, we recorded investment income of $0.7 million, compared with a loss of $6.8 million in 2015. The investment loss in 2015 was driven by losses in MLP investments.\nThe negative pre-tax operating margin in 2016 was driven by the $82.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Excluding investment income/(loss) on firm capital invested in our strategies, adjusted segment pre-tax operating margin declined from 29.9 percent in 2015 to 19.3 percent in 2016, due to lower management fees.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our AUM for the periods presented:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net outflows\n</td> <td>(1,003\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(572\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net market appreciation/(depreciation)\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(232\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MLP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net inflows/(outflows)\n</td> <td>(424\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net market appreciation/(depreciation)\n</td> <td>(402\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net outflows\n</td> <td>(1,427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,617\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(138\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net market appreciation/(depreciation)\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal AUM was $7.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Equity AUM was $3.6 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2016, as net client outflows of $1.0 billion were partially offset by net market appreciation of $0.4 billion. The asset management industry continues to be impacted by the ongoing trend of investors favoring passive investment vehicles over active management. In addition, performance in our small-cap and small/mid-cap value strategies has lagged their respective benchmarks on a three and five year basis, which contributed to client outflows during the year. Also, in mid-2017, we exited our Japan value product, which reduced AUM by approximately $0.8 billion. The reduction from client outflows in our value equity strategies was partially offset by client inflows into our new global equity strategy during the year. MLP AUM decreased to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2017 due to net market depreciation of $0.4 billion and net client outflows of $0.4 billion. The MLP market was challenged during most of the year with valuations declining since the second quarter of 2017. This market dynamic contributed to client outflows in the second half of the year.\nAt December 31, 2016, total AUM was $8.7 billion. Equity AUM was $4.1 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $5.0 billion at December 31, 2015 as net client outflows of $1.3 billion were partially offset by net market appreciation of $0.5 billion. The asset management industry has experienced an ongoing trend of investors favoring passive investment vehicles over active management. Our AUM outflows in 2016 reflected the impact of this trend, including a large investor in our all-cap product shifting to a passive investment. In addition, performance in our small/mid-cap and all-cap value strategies lagged their relative benchmarks which contributed to client outflows. These outflows were partially offset by client inflows related to the addition of an aggressive growth equity team in the fourth quarter of 2016. MLP AUM increased to $4.6 billion at December 31, 2016 as net market appreciation of $1.0 billion more than offset net client outflows of $0.3 billion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent accounting pronouncements are set forth in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and are incorporated herein by reference.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP and conform to practices within the securities industry. The preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP and industry practices requires us to make estimates and assumptions that could materially affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require us to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not considered by us to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical, including whether the estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information (e.g. third party or independent sources), the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be used under GAAP.\nFor a full description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following are our critical accounting policies.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments and other inventory positions owned, financial instruments and other inventory positions sold, but not yet purchased, and certain of our investments recorded in investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments recorded at fair value, either as required by accounting guidance or through the fair value election. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). Based on the nature of our business and our role as a \"dealer\" in the securities industry or as a manager of alternative asset management funds, the fair values of our financial instruments are determined internally. See Note 2 and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the valuation of our financial instruments and our fair value processes, including specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair value of our financial instruments.\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \"Fair Value Measurement,\" establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level I measurements) and the lowest priority to inputs with little or no pricing observability (Level III measurements). Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our assets and liabilities in the fair value hierarchy.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired requires certain management estimates. At December 31, 2017, we had goodwill of $81.9 million, all of which relates to our capital markets segment. At December 31, 2017, we had intangible assets of $22.8 million, of which $9.1 million relates to our capital markets segment and $13.7 million relates to our asset management segment.\nWe are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets annually and on an interim basis when circumstances exist that could indicate possible impairment. We have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after making an assessment, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we are required to perform the two-step impairment test, which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. As discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, we adopted new accounting guidance effective July 1, 2017 which eliminates the\nsecond step from the goodwill impairment test. Accordingly, we evaluate impairment charges based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our goodwill impairment testing.\nThe initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets and the subsequent quantitative impairment analysis involves significant judgment in determining the estimates of future cash flows, discount rates, economic forecast and other assumptions which are then used in acceptable valuation techniques, such as the market approach (earnings and/or transaction multiples) and/or the income approach (discounted cash flow method). Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value and any resulting impairment of goodwill. Our estimated cash flows, by their nature, are difficult to determine over an extended time period. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces and changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, and market conditions. To assess the reasonableness of cash flow estimates and validate assumptions used in our estimates, we review historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets. In assessing the fair value of our reporting units, the volatile nature of the securities markets and our industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows. In addition to discounted cash flows, we consider earnings multiples of comparable public companies and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions transactions of similar businesses in our subsequent impairment analysis.\nWe identified impairment indicators in the third quarter of 2017 related to our asset management reporting unit and performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2017, which resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $114.4 million. The impairment charge, which represented the full value of goodwill attributable to the asset management reporting unit, resulted from declining profitability in 2017 driven by lower revenues from reduced AUM and higher operating expenses from the addition of new investment teams. The fair value of the asset management reporting unit was calculated using the income approach (discounted cash flow method based on revenue and EBITDA forecasts) and market approach (earnings multiples of comparable public companies), which are valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for the reporting unit.\nWe elected to perform a qualitative assessment to test the goodwill in our capital markets reporting unit for impairment. The following relevant events and circumstances were evaluated in concluding that it was not more likely than not that this goodwill was impaired: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the overall financial performance of the capital markets reporting unit. Our annual goodwill impairment testing, performed as of October 31, 2017, resulted in no impairment associated with the capital markets reporting unit.\nWe also evaluated intangible assets (indefinite and definite-lived) and concluded there was no impairment in 2017.\nCompensation Plans\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nAs part of our compensation to employees and directors, we use stock-based compensation, consisting of restricted stock and restricted stock units. We account for equity awards in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation,\" (\"ASC 718\"), which requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized on the consolidated statements of operations at grant date fair value. Compensation expense related to share-based awards which require future service are amortized over the service period of the award. Forfeitures of awards with service conditions are accounted for when they occur. Share-based awards that do not require future service are recognized in the year in which the awards are deemed to be earned.\nSee Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our stock-based compensation plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, which includes all of our qualifying subsidiaries. We also are subject to income tax in various states and municipalities and those foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Amounts provided for income taxes are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in reporting certain items, principally restricted compensation (i.e., restricted stock, restricted stock units, restricted mutual fund shares (MFRS awards), and deferred compensation). The realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recognized to the extent that it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We believe that our future taxable profits will be sufficient to recognize our deferred tax assets. However, if our projections of future taxable profits do not materialize, we may conclude that a valuation allowance is necessary, which would impact our results of operations in that period. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we reversed the full amount of Simmons & Company International Limited's deferred tax asset valuation allowance based on projected future earnings. This resulted in a $0.8 million tax benefit to our results of operations.\nThe Tax Reform Act will have a significant impact on the federal tax code, including a corporate federal rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent effective in 2018. In addition, certain corporate tax deductions will be repealed or amended. For example, corporate tax deductions for certain public company executive compensation in excess of $1 million will no longer be allowed. Our 2017 results include a non-cash $54.2 million tax charge for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets arising from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act and the lower federal tax rate of 21 percent. As a result of the lower enacted federal tax rate, we anticipate our effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interest, and the income tax effects of stock-based compensation at the time of vesting, to be approximately 25 percent to 27 percent.\nWe record deferred tax benefits for future tax deductions expected upon the vesting of stock-based compensation. As discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, beginning January 1, 2017, new accounting guidance requires us to recognize the income tax effects of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest, rather than as additional paid-in capital. If deductions reported on our tax return for stock-based compensation (i.e., the value of the stock-based compensation at the time of vesting) exceed the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting (i.e., the grant date fair value of the compensation computed in accordance with ASC 718), we record the excess tax benefit as income tax benefit. Conversely, if deductions reported on our tax return for stock-based compensation are less than the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting, the deficiency is recorded as income tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $9.2 million tax benefit for stock awards vesting during the period. In the first quarter of 2018, approximately 530,000 shares vested at share prices greater than the grant date fair value, resulting in $5.0 million of excess tax benefits recorded as income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2018.\nWe establish reserves for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, \"Income Taxes,\" when it is not more likely than not that a certain position or component of a position will be ultimately upheld by the relevant taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. Our tax provision and related accruals include the impact of estimates for uncertain tax positions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate. To the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes, such change in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period of change and, in turn, our results of operations.\nLiquidity, Funding and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is of critical importance to us given the nature of our business. Insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances contributes to, and may be the cause of, financial institution failure. Accordingly, we regularly monitor our liquidity position and maintain a liquidity strategy designed to enable our business to continue to operate even under adverse circumstances, although there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful under all circumstances.\nThe majority of our tangible assets consist of assets readily convertible into cash. Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned are stated at fair value and are generally readily marketable in most market conditions. Receivables and payables with brokers, dealers and clearing organizations usually settle within a few days. As part of our liquidity strategy, we emphasize diversification of funding sources to the extent possible while considering tenor and cost. Our assets are financed by our cash flows from operations, equity capital, and our funding arrangements. The fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities are\ndirectly related to daily operating activities from our various businesses. One of our most important risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet reflect our overall risk tolerance, our ability to access stable funding sources and the amount of equity capital we hold.\nCertain market conditions can impact the liquidity of our inventory positions, requiring us to hold larger inventory positions for longer than expected or requiring us to take other actions that may adversely impact our results.\nA significant component of our employees' compensation is paid in annual discretionary incentive compensation. The timing of these incentive compensation payments, which generally are made in February, has a significant impact on our cash position and liquidity.\nBeginning in 2017, we initiated the payment of a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, which includes unvested restricted shares. Our board of directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis, and is free to change our dividend policy at any time.\nOur board of directors declared the following dividends:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Declaration Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dividend Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 2, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 20, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 13, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 27, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 26, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 15, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 27, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 28, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 15, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 26, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 29, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 15, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 1, 2018 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 26, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 15, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 1, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 26, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 15, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the annual special cash dividend based on fiscal year 2017 results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our board of directors approved a new dividend policy intended to return between 30 percent and 50 percent of our adjusted net income from the previous fiscal year to shareholders. This will include the addition of an annual special cash dividend, payable in the first quarter of each year. Our board of directors has declared a special cash dividend on the company's common stock of $1.62 per share. This special dividend will be paid on March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 26, 2018. Including this special cash dividend and the regular quarterly dividends totaling $1.25 per share paid during 2017, we will have returned $2.87 per share, or approximately 40 percent of our fiscal year 2017 adjusted net income to shareholders.\nEffective August 14, 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million in common shares through September 30, 2017. During 2017, we repurchased 36,936 shares our common stock at an average price of $67.62 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million related to this authorization.\nOn August 10, 2017, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million in common shares through September 30, 2019. The authorization became effective on September 30, 2017. No repurchases have been made in conjunction with this authorization through December 31, 2017.\nWe also purchase shares of common stock from restricted stock award recipients upon the award vesting as recipients sell shares to meet their employment tax obligations. During 2017, we purchased 314,542 shares or $23.0 million of our common stock for this purpose.\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were $33.8 million, a decrease of $7.6 million from December 31, 2016. Operating activities provided $232.1 million of cash, as non-cash charges and decreases in operating assets were partially offset by an increase in operating liabilities. Our $59.6 million net loss in 2017 included non-cash charges of $114.4 million related to goodwill impairment, $54.2 million for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets arising from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act and the lower federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent, and $15.4 million of intangible asset amortization. In 2017, we migrated to a fully disclosed clearing model and are no longer self clearing. This conversion resulted in a decrease in net operating assets related to the clearing and carrying of customer accounts as Pershing now facilitates our clearing and holds our customer accounts. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in inventory balances, particularly municipal securities, driven by a trading opportunity in the municipal market identified at the end of the year. The increase in operating liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in accrued compensation of $109.1 million, the result of higher compensation costs in 2017 resulting from increased revenues. In 2017, investing activities used $8.1 million of cash for the purchase of fixed assets. Cash of $233.1 million was used in financing activities as we reduced amounts due under our short-term financing by $128.9 million, primarily by decreasing our commercial paper funding as our clearing relationship with Pershing provided another source of financing. In addition, we repaid our $50.0 million Class A variable rate senior notes in full on the May 31, 2017 maturity date.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $148.6 million to $41.4 million at December 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. Operating activities provided $48.8 million of cash, as non-cash charges were partially offset by an increase in operating assets. Our $13.7 million net loss in 2016 included non-cash charges of $82.9 million related to goodwill impairment and $21.2 million of intangible asset amortization. The increase in intangible asset amortization was due to incremental expense related to our acquisitions of Simmons, River Branch and BMO GKST. The increase in operating assets primarily related to a receivable for unsettled trades, reverse repurchase agreements, which are principally used to make delivery on securities sold short, and additional investments in our senior living fund. Investing activities in 2016 used $83.7 million of which $72.7 million related to the acquisition of Simmons, and $11.0 million for the purchase of fixed assets. In 2016, financing activities used $111.6 million of cash as we repurchased $70.9 million of common stock. In addition, we used excess cash of $27.4 million to reduce amounts due under our short-term financing, primarily related to commercial paper, and also decreased our obligations related to repurchase agreements.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $174.0 million to $189.9 million at December 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014. Operating activities provided $379.5 million of cash primarily due to cash generated from earnings as well as a reduction in operating assets, particularly related to the liquidation of our municipal bond fund with outside investors, convertible securities inventory, and reverse repurchase agreements, which are principally used to make delivery on securities sold short. Investing activities in 2015 used $16.2 million of cash primarily related to the acquisitions of River Branch and BMO GKST, and the purchase of fixed assets. In 2015, financing activities used $189.0 million of cash as we repurchased $132.9 million of common stock, and experienced a $106.8 million decrease in noncontrolling interests resulting from the liquidation of our municipal bond fund with outside investors. In October 2015, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement under which we issued unsecured fixed rate senior notes that provided $125.0 million in financing, $75.0 million of which was used to repay our Class B variable rate senior notes that were due in November 2015.\nLeverage\nThe following table presents total assets, adjusted assets, total shareholders' equity and tangible shareholders' equity with the resulting leverage ratios as of:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,024,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,125,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deduct: Goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>(104,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(233,452\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deduct: Assets from noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>(54,917\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109,179\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,865,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,782,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>741,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>816,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deduct: Goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>(104,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(233,452\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deduct: Noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>(47,903\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,016\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>588,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>525,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage ratio (1)\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted leverage ratio (2)\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders' equity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible common shareholders' equity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted assets and tangible common shareholders' equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Goodwill and intangible assets are subtracted from total assets and total shareholders' equity in determining adjusted assets and tangible common shareholders' equity, respectively, as we believe that goodwill and intangible assets do not constitute operating assets which can be deployed in a liquid manner. Amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests are subtracted from total assets and total shareholders' equity in determining adjusted assets and tangible common shareholders' equity, respectively, as they represent assets and equity interests in consolidated entities that are not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to Piper Jaffray Companies. We view the resulting measure of adjusted leverage, also a non-GAAP financial measure, as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services companies.\nFunding and Capital Resources\nThe primary goal of our funding activities is to ensure adequate funding over a wide range of market conditions. Given the mix of our business activities, funding requirements are fulfilled through a diversified range of short-term and long-term financing. We attempt to ensure that the tenor of our borrowing liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our ability to support increases in total assets is largely a function of our ability to obtain funding from external sources. Access to these external sources, as well as the cost of that financing, is dependent upon various factors, including market conditions, the general availability of credit and credit ratings. We currently do not have a credit rating, which could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position by increasing our financing costs and limiting access to sources of liquidity that require a credit rating as a condition to providing the funds.\nIn 2017, we migrated to a fully disclosed clearing model and are no longer self clearing. Pershing is our clearing broker dealer. The conversion provided us with a new funding source through Pershing and, as a result, changed our mix of funding sources.\nOur day-to-day funding and liquidity is obtained primarily through the use of our clearing arrangement with Pershing, commercial paper issuance, prime broker agreements, and bank lines of credit, and is typically collateralized by our securities inventory. These funding sources are critical to our ability to finance and hold inventory, which is a necessary part of our institutional brokerage business. The majority of our inventory is liquid and is therefore funded by short-term facilities. Certain of these short-term facilities (i.e., committed line and commercial paper) have been established to mitigate changes in the liquidity of our inventory based on changing market conditions. In the case of our committed line, it is available to us regardless of changes in market liquidity conditions through the end of its term, although there may be limitations on the type of securities available to pledge. Our commercial paper program helps mitigate changes in market liquidity conditions given it is not an overnight facility, but provides funding with a term of 27 to 270 days. Our funding sources are also dependent on the types of inventory that our counterparties are willing to accept as collateral and the number of counterparties available. Funding is generally obtained at rates based upon the federal funds rate or the London Interbank Offer Rate.\nPershing Clearing Arrangement - We have established an arrangement to obtain financing from Pershing related to the majority of our trading activities. Under our fully disclosed clearing agreement, the majority of our securities inventories and all of our customer activities are held by or cleared through Pershing. Financing under this arrangement is secured primarily by securities, and collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available under this arrangement. Our clearing arrangement activities are recorded net from trading activity and reported within receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations. The funding is at the discretion of Pershing and could be denied. Our fully disclosed clearing agreement includes a covenant requiring Piper Jaffray & Co. to maintain excess net capital of $120 million. At December 31, 2017, we had $160.2 million of financing outstanding under this arrangement.\nCommercial Paper Program - Our U.S. broker dealer subsidiary, Piper Jaffray & Co., issues secured commercial paper to fund a portion of its securities inventory. This commercial paper is currently issued under two separate programs, CP Series A and CP Series II A, and is secured by different inventory classes, which is reflected in the interest rate paid on the respective program. The programs can issue commercial paper with maturities of 27 to 270 days. CP Series II A includes a revised covenant that requires Piper Jaffray & Co. to maintain excess net capital of $100 million. During the third quarter of 2017, we retired the CP Series III A program, and increased the maximum amount that may be issued under CP Series II A from $150 million to $200 million. The following table provides information about our commercial paper programs at December 31, 2017:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CP Series A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CP Series II A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum amount that may be issued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average maturity, in days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average maturity at issuance, in days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrime Broker Arrangements - We have established an arrangement to obtain overnight financing by a single prime broker related to certain strategic trading activities in municipal securities. Additionally, we have established a second overnight financing arrangement with another broker dealer related to our convertible securities inventories. Financing under these arrangements is secured primarily by securities, and collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available under these arrangements. Our prime broker financing activities are recorded net of receivables from trading activity. The funding is at the discretion of the prime brokers and could be denied subject to a notice period. At December 31, 2017, we had $240.0 million of financing outstanding under these prime broker arrangements.\nCommitted Lines - Our committed line is a one-year $200 million revolving secured credit facility. We use this credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations, and the amount borrowed under the facility varies daily based on our funding needs. Advances under this facility are secured by certain marketable securities. The facility includes a covenant that requires Piper Jaffray & Co. to maintain minimum net capital of $120 million, and the unpaid principal amount of all advances under the facility will be due on December 14, 2018. This credit facility has been in place since 2008 and we renewed the facility for another one-year term in the fourth quarter of 2017. At December 31, 2017, we had no advances against this line of credit.\nUncommitted Line - We use this uncommitted line in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations, and the amount borrowed under our uncommitted line varies daily based on our funding needs. Our $85 million uncommitted secured line is dependent on having appropriate collateral, as determined by the bank agreement, to secure an advance under the line. Collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available under this secured line. Our uncommitted line is discretionary and is not a commitment by the bank to provide an advance under the line. More specifically, the line is subject to approval by the bank each time an advance is requested and advances may be denied, which may be particularly true during times of market stress or market perceptions of our exposures. We manage our relationship with the bank that provides this uncommitted facility in order to have appropriate levels of funding for our business.

The Class C Notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 5.06 percent, are payable semi-annually and mature on October 9, 2018. The unpaid principal amount is due in full on the maturity date and may not be prepaid. The $50 million of variable rate Class A Notes issued in 2014 were repaid in full on the May 31, 2017 maturity date.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement includes customary events of default and covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and minimum regulatory net capital, limit our leverage ratio and require maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to fixed charges. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts at December 31, 2017, in total and by remaining maturity. Excluded from the table are a number of obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition that generally are short-term in nature, including secured financing transactions, trading liabilities, short-term borrowings and other payables and accrued liabilities. The amounts presented in the table below may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements, because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023 and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> - 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> - 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment commitments (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes\n</td> <td>125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The investment commitments have no specified call dates.

Purchase commitments with variable pricing provisions are included in the table based on the minimum contractual amounts. Certain purchase commitments contain termination or renewal provisions. The table reflects the minimum contractual amounts likely to be paid under these agreements assuming the contracts are not terminated.\nNew Leases Guidance\nAs discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we will adopt new accounting guidance related to leases effective as of January 1, 2019. The guidance requires lessees to recognize all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on the statements of financial position. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 65 operating leases for office space with aggregate minimum lease commitments of $68.9 million. Upon adoption of the new guidance, this lease commitment will be reflected on our statement of financial condition as a right-of-use asset and a lease commitment liability. The impact of the new guidance on Piper Jaffray & Co.'s net capital is expected to be minimal.\nCapital Requirements\nAs a registered broker dealer and member firm of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\"FINRA\"), Piper Jaffray & Co., our U.S. broker dealer subsidiary, is subject to the uniform net capital rule of the SEC and the net capital rule of FINRA. We have elected to use the alternative method permitted by the uniform net capital rule which requires that we maintain minimum net capital of $1.0 million. Advances to affiliates, repayment of subordinated liabilities, dividend payments and other equity withdrawals are subject to certain approvals, notifications and other provisions of the uniform net capital rules. We expect that these provisions will not impact our ability to meet current and future obligations. At December 31, 2017, our net capital under the SEC's uniform net capital rule was $137.6 million, and exceeded the minimum net capital required under the SEC rule by $136.6 million.\nAlthough we operate with a level of net capital substantially greater than the minimum thresholds established by FINRA and the SEC, a substantial reduction of our capital would curtail many of our Capital Markets revenue producing activities.\nOur committed short-term credit facility and our senior notes with PIMCO include covenants requiring Piper Jaffray & Co. to maintain minimum net capital of $120 million. Secured commercial paper issued under CP Series II A includes a covenant that requires Piper Jaffray & Co. to maintain excess net capital of $100 million. Our fully disclosed clearing agreement with Pershing also includes a covenant requiring Piper Jaffray & Co. to maintain excess net capital of $120 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, Piper Jaffray Ltd., our broker dealer subsidiary registered in the United Kingdom, was subject to, and was in compliance with, the capital requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority pursuant to the Financial Services Act of 2012.\nPiper Jaffray Hong Kong Limited is licensed by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, which is subject to the liquid capital requirements of the Securities and Futures (Financial Resources) Rule promulgated under the Securities and Futures Ordinance. At December 31, 2017, Piper Jaffray Hong Kong Limited was in compliance with the liquid capital requirements of the Hong Kong Securities and Trade Commission.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business we enter into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements.

The uncollateralized amounts, representing the fair value of the derivative contracts, expose us to the credit risk of these counterparties.

Rather, the fair value of the derivative transactions are reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition as assets or liabilities in financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold, but not yet purchased, as applicable. For a complete discussion of our activities related to derivative products, see Note 5, \"Financial Instruments and Other Inventory Positions Owned and Financial Instruments and Other Inventory Positions Sold, but Not Yet Purchased,\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Commitments\nWe have investments, including those made as part of our merchant banking activities, in various limited partnerships or limited liability companies that provide financing or make investments in companies. We commit capital and/or act as the managing partner of these entities. For additional information on our activities related to these types of entities, see Note 7, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have committed capital of $72.5 million to certain entities and these commitments generally have no specified call dates.\nRisk Management\nRisk is an inherent part of our business. The principal risks we face in operating our business include: strategic risk, market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, human capital risk, and legal and regulatory risks. The extent to which we properly identify and effectively manage each of these risks is critical to our financial condition and profitability. We have a formal risk management process to identify, assess and monitor each risk and mitigating controls in accordance with defined policies and procedures. The risk management functions are independent of our business lines. Our management takes an active role in the risk management process, and the results are reported to senior management and the Board of Directors.\nThe audit committee of the Board of Directors oversees management's processes for identifying and evaluating our major risks, and the policies, procedures and practices employed by management to govern its risk assessment and risk management processes. The nominating and governance committee of the Board of Directors oversees the Board of Directors' committee structures and functions as they relate to the various committees' responsibilities with respect to oversight of our major risk exposures. With respect to these major risk exposures, the audit committee is responsible for overseeing management's monitoring and control of our major risk exposures relating to market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, legal and regulatory risk, operational risk (including cybersecurity), and human capital risk relating to misconduct, fraud, and legal and compliance matters. Our compensation committee is responsible for overseeing management's monitoring and control of our major risk exposures relating to compensation, organizational structure, and succession. Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing management's monitoring and control of our major risk exposures related to our corporate strategy. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer meet with the audit committee on a quarterly basis to discuss our market, liquidity, and legal and regulatory risks, and provide updates to the Board of Directors, audit committee, and compensation committee concerning the other major risk exposures on a regular basis.\nWe use internal committees to assist in governing risk and ensure that our business activities are properly assessed, monitored and managed. Our financial risk committees manage our market, liquidity and credit risks, and oversee risk management practices related to these risks, including defining acceptable risk tolerances and approving risk management policies. Membership is comprised of senior leadership, including but not limited to, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Treasurer, Head of Market and Credit Risk, Head of Public Finance, and Head of Fixed Income Services and Firm Investments and Trading. Other committees that help evaluate and monitor risk include underwriting, leadership team and operating committees. These committees help manage risk by ensuring that business activities are properly managed and within a defined scope of activity. Our valuation committee, comprised of members of senior management and risk management, provide oversight and overall responsibility for the internal control processes and procedures related to fair value measurements. Additionally, our operational risk committees address and monitor risk related to information systems and security, legal, regulatory and compliance matters, and third parties such as vendors and service providers.\nWith respect to market risk and credit risk, the cornerstone of our risk management process is daily communication among traders, trading department management and senior management concerning our inventory positions, including those associated with our strategic trading activities, and overall risk profile. Our risk management functions supplement this communication process by providing their independent perspectives on our market and credit risk profile on a daily basis. The broader objectives of our risk management functions are to understand the risk profile of each trading area, to consolidate risk monitoring company-wide, to assist in implementing effective hedging strategies, to articulate large trading or position risks to senior management, and to ensure accurate fair values of our financial instruments.\nRisk management techniques, processes and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, and any risk management failures could expose us to material unanticipated losses.\nStrategic Risk\nStrategic risk represents the risk associated with executive management failing to develop and execute on the appropriate strategic vision which demonstrates a commitment to our culture, leverages our core competencies, appropriately responds to external factors in the marketplace, and is in the best interests of our clients, employees and shareholders.\nOur leadership team is responsible for managing our strategic risks. The Board of Directors oversees the leadership team in setting and executing our strategic plan.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk represents the risk of losses, or financial volatility, that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price. Our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary for our clients, to our market-making activities and our strategic trading activities. Market risks are inherent to both cash and derivative financial instruments. The scope of our market risk management policies and procedures includes all market-sensitive financial instruments.\nOur different types of market risk include:\nInterest Rate Risk - Interest rate risk represents the potential volatility from changes in market interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in the slope of the yield curve, changes in credit spreads, and the rate of prepayments on our interest-earning assets (e.g., inventories) and our funding sources (e.g., short-term financing) which finance these assets. Interest rate risk is managed by selling short U.S. government securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts. See Note 5 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative contracts. Our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk. Also, we establish limits on the notional level of our fixed income securities inventory and manage net positions within those limits.\nEquity Price Risk - Equity price risk represents the potential loss in value due to adverse changes in the level or volatility of equity prices. We are exposed to equity price risk through our trading activities in the U.S. market. We attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our market-making and in our inventory of equity securities by establishing limits on the notional level of our inventory and by managing net position levels within those limits.\nForeign Exchange Risk - Foreign exchange risk represents the potential volatility to earnings or capital arising from movement in foreign exchange rates. A modest portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. A change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain/loss (recorded in our consolidated statements of operations) or a foreign currency translation adjustment (recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within the shareholders' equity section of our consolidated statements of financial condition and other comprehensive income/(loss) within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income).\nValue-at-Risk (\"VaR\")\nWe use the statistical technique known as VaR to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures in our trading portfolios. VaR is the potential loss in value of our trading positions, excluding noncontrolling interests, due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. We perform a daily VaR analysis on substantially all of our trading positions, including fixed income, equities, convertible bonds, mortgage-backed securities and all associated economic hedges. These positions encompass both customer-related and strategic trading activities. A VaR model provides a common metric for assessing market risk across business lines and products. Changes in VaR between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of risk exposure, volatilities and/or correlations among asset classes and individual securities.\nWe use a Monte Carlo simulation methodology for VaR calculations. We believe this methodology provides VaR results that properly reflect the risk profile of all our instruments, including those that contain optionality, and also accurately models correlation movements among all of our asset classes. In addition, it provides improved tail results as there are no assumptions of distribution, and can provide additional insight for scenario shock analysis.\nModel-based VaR derived from simulation has inherent limitations including: reliance on historical data to predict future market risk; VaR calculated using a one-day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day; and published VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions.\nThe modeling of the market risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While we believe that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable, different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates. When comparing our VaR numbers to those of other firms, it is important to remember that different methodologies, assumptions and approximations could produce significantly different results.\nThe following table quantifies the model-based VaR simulated for each component of market risk for the periods presented, which are computed using the past 250 days of historical data. When calculating VaR we use a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day time horizon. This means that, over time, there is a one in 20 chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported VaR. Shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported VaR by significant amounts. Shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon, such as a number of consecutive trading days. Therefore, there can be no assurance that actual losses occurring on any given day arising from changes in market conditions will not exceed the VaR amounts shown below or that such losses will not occur more than once in a 20-day trading period.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Rate Risk\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity Price Risk\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diversification Effect (1)\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Value-at-Risk\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>711\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the two risk categories.

The increase in VaR was due to increased inventory levels in asset classes that are accretive to VaR, particularly municipal securities, as we capitalized on a trading opportunity in the municipal market toward the end of the measurement period.\nIn addition to VaR, we also employ additional measures to monitor and manage market risk exposure including net market position, duration exposure, option sensitivities, and inventory turnover. All metrics are aggregated by asset concentration and are used for monitoring limits and exception approvals. In times of market volatility, we also perform ad hoc stress tests and scenario analysis as market conditions dictate. Unlike our VaR, which measures potential losses within a given confidence level, stress scenarios do not have an associated implied probability. Rather, stress testing is used to estimate the potential loss from market moves outside our VaR confidence levels.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we are unable to timely access necessary funding sources in order to operate our business, as well as the risk that we are unable to timely divest securities that we hold in connection with our market-making, sales and trading, and strategic trading activities. We are exposed to liquidity risk in our day-to-day funding activities, by holding potentially illiquid inventory positions and in our role as a remarketing agent for variable rate demand notes.\nSee the section entitled \"Liquidity, Funding and Capital Resources\" for information regarding our liquidity and how we manage liquidity risk.\nOur inventory positions, including those associated with strategic trading activities, subject us to potential financial losses from the reduction in value of illiquid positions. Market risk can be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and/or at normal bid-offer spreads. Depending on the specific security, the structure of the financial product, and/or overall market conditions, we may be forced to hold a security for substantially longer than we had planned or forced to liquidate into a challenging market if funding becomes unavailable.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk refers to the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty, customer, borrower or issuer of securities we hold in our trading inventory. The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved. Credit risk also results from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with us or otherwise fail to perform as agreed. This may be reflected through issues such as settlement obligations or payment collections.\nOur different types of credit risk include:\nCredit Spread Risk - Credit spread risk arises from the possibility that changes in credit spreads will affect the value of financial instruments. Credit spreads represent the credit risk premiums required by market participants for a given credit quality (e.g., the additional yield that a debt instrument issued by a AA-rated entity must produce over a risk-free alternative). Changes in credit spreads result from potential changes in an issuer's credit rating or the market's perception of the issuer's credit worthiness. We are exposed to credit spread risk with the debt instruments held in our trading inventory, including those held for strategic trading activities. We enter into transactions to hedge our exposure to credit spread risk through the use of derivatives and certain other financial instruments. These hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating credit spread risk.\nDeterioration/Default Risk - Deterioration/default risk represents the risk due to an issuer, counterparty or borrower failing to fulfill its obligations. We are exposed to deterioration/default risk in our role as a trading counterparty to dealers and customers, as a holder of securities, and as a member of exchanges. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and/or issuer of the security. We mitigate this risk by establishing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits for each counterparty relative to potential levels of activity, holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions. Our risk management functions also evaluate the potential risk associated with institutional counterparties with whom we hold derivatives, TBAs and other documented institutional counterparty agreements that may give rise to credit exposure.\nCollections Risk - Collections risk arises from ineffective management and monitoring of collecting outstanding debts and obligations, including those related to our customer trading activities and margin lending. Our client activities involve the execution, settlement and financing of various transactions. Client activities are transacted on a delivery versus payment, cash or margin basis. Our credit exposure to institutional client business is mitigated by the use of industry-standard delivery versus payment through depositories and clearing banks. Credit exposure associated with our customer margin accounts in the U.S. is monitored daily. Our risk management functions have credit risk policies establishing appropriate credit limits and collateralization thresholds for our customers utilizing margin lending.\nConcentration Risk - Concentration risk is the risk due to concentrated exposure to a particular product; individual issuer, borrower or counterparty; financial instrument; or geographic area. We are subject to concentration risk if we hold large individual securities positions, execute large transactions with individual counterparties or groups of related counterparties, or make substantial underwriting commitments. Concentration risk can occur by industry, geographic area or type of client. Securities purchased under agreements to resell consist primarily of securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. The counterparties to these agreements typically are primary dealers of U.S. government securities and major financial institutions. Inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made, including underwritings, may result in exposure to individual issuers and businesses. Potential concentration risk is carefully monitored through review of counterparties and borrowers and is managed through the use of policies and limits established by senior management.\nWe have concentrated counterparty credit exposure with five non-publicly rated entities totaling $19.1 million at December 31, 2017. This counterparty credit exposure is part of our matched-book derivative program related to our public finance business, consisting primarily of interest rate swaps. One derivative counterparty represents 78.1 percent, or $14.9 million, of this exposure. Credit exposure associated with our derivative counterparties is driven by uncollateralized market movements in the fair value of\nthe interest rate swap contracts and is monitored regularly by our financial risk committee. We attempt to minimize the credit (or repayment) risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by senior management.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss, or damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people and systems or from external events. We rely on the ability of our employees and our systems, both internal and at computer centers operated by third parties, to process a large number of transactions. Our systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of our systems or improper action by our employees or third party vendors, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation. We also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the exchanges, fully disclosed clearing firms, or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.\nOur operations rely on secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our internal and outsourced computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, internal misconduct or inadvertent errors and other events that could have an information security impact. The occurrence of one or more of these events, which we have experienced, could jeopardize our or our clients' or counterparties' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients', our counterparties' or third parties' operations. We take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant.\nIn order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization. We also have business continuity plans in place that we believe will cover critical processes on a company-wide basis, and redundancies are built into our systems as we have deemed appropriate. These control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits.\nIn 2017, we migrated to a fully disclosed clearing model for all of our clearing operations. In a fully disclosed clearing model, we act as an introducing broker for client transactions and rely on Pershing, our clearing broker dealer, to facilitate clearance and settlement of our clients' securities transactions. Subsequent to transitioning to a fully disclosed clearing model, the clearing services provided by Pershing are critical to our business operations, and similar to other services performed by third party vendors, any failure by Pershing with respect to the services we rely upon Pershing to provide could cause financial loss, significantly disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to serve our clients and manage our exposure to risk.\nHuman Capital Risk\nOur business is a human capital business and our success is dependent upon the skills, expertise and performance of our employees. Human capital risks represent the risks posed if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals who are motivated to serve the best interests of our clients, thereby serving the best interests of our company. Attracting and retaining employees depends, among other things, on our company's culture, management, work environment, geographic locations and compensation. There are risks associated with the proper recruitment, development and rewards of our employees to ensure quality performance and retention.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\nLegal and regulatory risk includes the risk of non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and loss to our reputation we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. We are generally subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have established procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, such as public company reporting obligations, regulatory net capital requirements, sales and trading practices, potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, privacy and recordkeeping. We have also established procedures that are designed to require that our policies relating to ethics and business conduct are followed. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for us.\nOur business also subjects us to the complex income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we have business operations, and these tax laws may be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes.\nEffects of Inflation\nBecause our assets are liquid and generally short-term in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as employee compensation, office space leasing costs and communications charges, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services we offer to our clients. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has adverse effects upon the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and exhibits included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Form 10-K may be considered forward-looking. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results, and also may include our belief regarding the effect of various legal proceedings, as set forth under \"Legal Proceedings\" in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K and in our subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including those factors discussed below under \"External Factors Impacting Our Business\" as well as the factors identified under \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K, as updated in our subsequent reports filed with the SEC. These reports are available at our Web site at www.piperjaffray.com and at the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). These non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments to exclude (1) revenues and expenses related to noncontrolling interests, (2) amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, (3) compensation and non-compensation expenses from acquisition-related agreements, (4) restructuring and acquisition integration costs, (5) goodwill impairment charges and (6) the impact from remeasuring deferred tax assets resulting from changes to the U.S. federal tax code. These adjustments affect the following financial measures: net revenues, compensation expenses, non-compensation expenses, income tax expense/(benefit), net income/(loss) applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies, earnings/(loss) per diluted common share, return on average common shareholders' equity, segment net revenues, segment operating expenses, segment pre-tax operating income/(loss) and segment pre-tax operating margin. Management believes that presenting these results and measures on an adjusted basis in conjunction with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures provides the most meaningful basis for comparison of its operating results across periods, and enhances the overall understanding of our current financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nExecutive Overview\nStrategic Growth Initiatives - Beginning in 2011, following the financial crisis, we implemented a strategic framework focused on achieving strong results across various markets conditions, sustainable growth and predictability in earnings, as well as expanding operating margin. Our plan focused on increasing the contributions from our higher margin activities (i.e., advisory services and public finance), diversifying the business, managing operating costs diligently, and investing for growth. Through strong execution on these strategic initiatives we have produced a substantial increase in net revenues and remixed the business to higher quality earnings. These favorable attributes have generated greater earnings and enabled us to return capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends, which we initiated in the first quarter of 2017 and subsequently increased going into 2018. Our investments in the business are discussed below.\nOverview of Operations - Our operations are principally engaged in providing investment banking, institutional brokerage, asset management and related financial services to corporations, private equity groups, public entities, non-profit entities and institutional investors in the United States and Europe. We operate through two reportable business segments:\nCapital Markets - The Capital Markets segment provides investment banking services and institutional sales, trading and research services. Investment banking services include management of and participation in underwritings, financial advisory services and public finance activities. Revenues are generated through the receipt of advisory and financing fees. Institutional sales, trading and research services focus on the trading of equity and fixed income products with institutions, government and non-profit entities. Revenues are generated through commissions and sales credits earned on equity and fixed income institutional sales activities, net interest revenues on trading securities held in inventory, and profits and losses from trading these securities. Also, we generate revenue through strategic trading and investing activities, which focus on investments in municipal bonds and U.S. government agency securities. In order to invest firm capital and to manage capital from outside investors, we have created alternative asset management funds in merchant banking that involve equity or debt investments in late stage private companies; senior living, which provides financing to U.S. senior living facilities; and energy, whose principal activity is to invest in oil and gas services companies headquartered in Europe. We receive management and performance fees for managing these funds.\nWe have executed on our strategic growth initiatives through investments in the business, primarily by expanding into new industry sectors within equity investment banking and equity institutional brokerage, and the expansion of our fixed income middle market sales platform. The following is a summary of these activities.\n \u2022 As part of our strategy to expand our equity investment banking business into the energy sector and grow our advisory  business, on February 26, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Simmons & Company International (\"Simmons\"), an employee-owned investment bank and broker dealer focused on the energy industry. For more information on our acquisition of Simmons, see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 In 2015, we built upon our expansion into the financial institutions sector by acquiring the assets of River Branch Holdings LLC (\"River Branch\"), an equity investment banking boutique focused on the financial institutions sector. Also in 2015, we completed the acquisition of BMO Capital Markets GKST Inc. (\"BMO GKST\"), a municipal bond sales, trading and origination business of BMO Financial Corp. \n \u2022 Over the past several years, we have added and strengthened sub-sectors across our industry groups. In equity investment banking, we added healthy living in our consumer sector and strengthened our healthcare sector with biotech and healthcare information technology practices. In addition, we broadened our specialty practices in public finance with additions in senior living and charter schools. \nWe have investment commitments related to affiliated entities which will make direct or indirect debt investments in companies. In 2018, we anticipate that we will begin to underwrite and syndicate loans through these entities.\nAsset Management - The Asset Management segment, which provides traditional asset management services, manages investments in master limited partnerships (\"MLPs\") and energy infrastructure securities focused on the energy sector, and manages assets in domestic and global equity markets. Revenues are generated in the form of management and performance fees. Revenues are also generated through investments in the partnerships and funds that we manage.\nAn explicit element of our strategy in asset management has been to diversify our product offerings through the addition of high quality investment teams. In addition to our core MLP and value equity products, we have added teams specializing in domestic growth equity, global equity, and quantitative strategies, allowing us to leverage the infrastructure of our existing platform.\nIn 2017, our Asset Management segment experienced declining profitability due to decreases in revenues from reduced AUM and higher operating expenses from the addition of new investment teams. In the third quarter of 2017, we identified goodwill impairment indicators necessitating a full impairment testing of goodwill. The interim impairment testing related to our Asset Management segment goodwill resulted in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $114.4 million. For more information on our goodwill impairment testing, please refer to the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" section.\nIn 2016, an extended cycle of investors favoring passive investment vehicles over active management, combined with certain products having investment performance below their benchmarks, reduced management fees for the asset management business and caused a corresponding decline in profitability. Lower average AUM for our MLP strategies, driven by a decline in MLP valuations, also resulted in decreased management fees and profitability. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing, including the goodwill associated with our Asset Management segment, which resulted in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $82.9 million.\nFinancial Highlights\n\nN/M - Not meaningful\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017\n \u2022 Net revenues increased 17.1 percent compared to 2016. Significantly higher advisory services revenues, as well as higher equity financing revenues, were partially offset by lower debt financing, institutional brokerage and asset management revenues. \n \u2022 Compensation and benefits expenses were up 21.0 percent compared to the year-ago period due primarily to increased compensation expenses arising from increased revenues, as well as higher acquisition-related compensation costs related to a performance award plan implemented in conjunction with our acquisition of Simmons. In 2017, we recorded $27.0 million of compensation expense related to this plan, compared to $4.3 million in 2016. The higher compensation costs were due to outperformance of the Simmons business in 2017. \n \u2022 Non-compensation expenses increased 7.1 percent compared to 2016. In 2017, we incurred a $114.4 million goodwill impairment charge, compared to a $82.9 million goodwill impairment charge in 2016. Also, incremental back office conversion costs in the current year were more than offset by lower restructuring costs. In 2016, non-compensation expenses included $10.2 million of restructuring and integration costs primarily related to the acquisition of Simmons. \n \u2022 The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, required a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets resulting in a $54.2 million non-cash write-off in the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $9.2 million related to restricted stock vesting at values greater than the grant price. The tax benefit increased earnings per diluted common share by $0.72 in 2017. \n \u2022 In 2017, our return on average common shareholders' equity was a negative 8.1 percent, compared with a negative 2.8 percent for 2016. On an adjusted basis, we generated a return on average common shareholders' equity of 14.2 percent(2) in 2017, compared with 9.2 percent(2) for 2016. \n(1) Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financial information\n\n (2) Adjusted return on average common shareholders' equity, a non-GAAP measure, is computed by dividing adjusted net income applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies for the last 12 months by average monthly common shareholders' equity. For a detailed explanation of the components of adjusted net income, see \"Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financial information\" in footnote (1). \n (3) Piper Jaffray Companies calculates earnings per common share using the two-class method, which requires the allocation of consolidated adjusted net income between common shareholders and participating security holders, which in the case of Piper Jaffray Companies, represents unvested stock with dividend rights. No allocation of undistributed earnings is made for periods in which a loss is incurred. \nMarket Data\nThe following table provides a summary of relevant market data over the past three years.\n\n (a) Data provided is at period end. \n (b) Source: Thomson Reuters (transactions with reported deal value between $100 million and $1 billion and transactions with an undisclosed deal value that had a financial advisor). \n (c) Source: Dealogic (offerings with reported market value greater than $20 million). \n (d) Source: Thomson Reuters. \n (e) Number of transactions includes convertible offerings. \n (f) Calculated based on the 10-year Municipal Market Data (MMD) index rate divided by the 10-year treasury rate. \nExternal Factors Impacting Our Business\nPerformance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity. Overall market conditions are a product of many factors, which are beyond our control, often unpredictable and at times inherently volatile. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions, the relative level of volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, changes in interest rates and credit spreads (especially rapid and extreme changes), overall market liquidity, the level and shape of various yield curves, the volume and value of trading in securities, overall equity valuations, and the demand for active asset management services.\nFactors that differentiate our business within the financial services industry also may affect our financial results. For example, our capital markets business focuses on specific industry sectors while serving principally middle-market clientele. If the business environment for our focus sectors is impacted adversely, our business and results of operations could reflect these impacts. In addition, our business, with its specific areas of focus and investment, may not track overall market trends. Given the variability of the capital markets and securities businesses, our earnings may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and results for any individual period should not be considered indicative of future results.\nOutlook for 2018\nWe expect the U.S. economy to continue to grow at a moderate pace in 2018. The recently passed tax reform legislation, increased fiscal spending, actions to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses, and broad growth across most major global economies should be supportive to economic growth in the U.S. Conversely, geopolitical risks or economic instability internationally may pose consequences for the global economy and inject periods of heightened volatility into the U.S. equity and debt markets.\nWe believe that U.S. monetary policy could possibly have a material impact on the economy in 2018. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates three times in 2017 on the expectation of stronger economic growth despite muted signs of inflation. Long-term interest rates, however, have not moved in step with increases in short-term interest rates resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. We anticipate that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to pursue a gradual and steady path to rate normalization, particularly if there is acceleration in the pace of inflation. Higher interest rates could trigger a sell-off in equities which would likely adversely impact our equity capital raising and advisory businesses. Further, if long-term interest rates prove resistant to a tightening in monetary policy, we could experience an extended period of a flat, or even an inverse, yield curve, which could adversely impact our fixed income sales and trading business. In addition, exogenous conditions may trigger episodes of volatility with respect to interest rates. A volatile interest rate environment could manifest itself in changes to the yield curve or relative spreads which may have a mixed impact on certain of our businesses.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\"), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, will have a significant impact on the federal tax code, including a significant corporate federal rate reduction and tax treatment which would facilitate the repatriation of earnings from overseas profits. The lower corporate tax rate will result in additional earnings, which we will use to invest in our business and to return capital to our shareholders through dividends. We will also continue to look for opportunistic investments that are in line with our strategy. Although the full impact of the Tax Reform Act on our businesses is not yet known, we would anticipate that certain sectors of our businesses may be affected more than others. We expect that our public finance operations will be adversely impacted as the repeal of tax-exempt advance refunding bonds through the Tax Reform Act will result in a decline in municipal issuance volume in the market. The impact on our equity investment banking businesses is expected to be favorable, albeit at a moderate level. The Tax Reform Act is not expected to have a significant impact on our institutional brokerage or asset management businesses. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of this legislation on our businesses.\nWe expect conditions in the equity markets to remain conducive to our advisory and equity capital raising activities in 2018. While lower volatility benefits our capital raising business, it has the inverse effect on our equity sales and trading business. We have experienced heightened volatility in early 2018. If we experience sustained bouts of higher volatility or a material market correction, our equity brokerage business may benefit while our advisory and equity capital raising businesses may suffer. We believe our advisory services business will continue to perform well in 2018 on the strength of our market position, long-term investments, diversity in our practice and readily available capital. As noted above, economic instability arising from a significant geopolitical event, for example, or an adverse market reaction to monetary tightening would likely be detrimental to both our equity capital raising and advisory businesses. Advisory services revenues for any given quarter are impacted by the timing and size of the deals closing, which can result in fluctuations in revenues period over period.\nWe expect that secular challenges to our equity brokerage business, including the shift from active to passive managers, will persist in 2018. These challenges may be exacerbated by the implementation of MiFID II, a European regulation which may be adopted by some of our U.S. clients. This regulation, which governs how buyside clients (asset managers) pay for services performed by brokerage businesses, may lead to revenue declines for U.S brokerage businesses, and we would not be immune from this impact.\nWe would expect the low interest rate environment and flat yield curve to persist in 2018. This would continue to subdue customer flow activity for our fixed income institutional brokerage business. While higher interest rates across the yield curve would be favorable to this business, the move to higher rates could adversely impact our public finance business in the short-term as the level of refunding activity eases while greater economic growth has not yet spurred a ramp in new money issuance volumes. Irrespective of the interest rate levels, we believe that municipal debt underwriting activity will be down meaningfully in 2018 compared to 2017 as some issuances were accelerated to the end of 2017 due to pending changes from the tax reform legislation, and also due to a lower level of refunding activity.\nAs economic growth continues we would expect rising market valuations, which would have a positive impact on our asset management business. However, market valuations may be negatively impacted by significant declines and volatility in the financial markets, as experienced in early 2018. We would expect that active asset managers, ourselves included, will remain under pressure to create alpha for their clients and to maintain or grow AUM.\nResults of Operations\nFinancial Summary\nThe following table provides a summary of the results of our operations on a U.S. GAAP basis and the results of our operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated.\n",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and exhibits included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Form 10-K may be considered forward-looking. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results, and also may include our belief regarding the effect of various legal proceedings, as set forth under \"Legal Proceedings\" in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K and in our subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including those factors discussed below under \"External Factors Impacting Our Business\" as well as the factors identified under \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K, as updated in our subsequent reports filed with the SEC. These reports are available at our Web site at www.piperjaffray.com and at the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). These non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments to exclude (1) revenues and expenses related to noncontrolling interests, (2) amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, (3) compensation and non-compensation expenses from acquisition-related agreements, (4) restructuring and acquisition integration costs, (5) goodwill impairment charges and (6) the impact from remeasuring deferred tax assets resulting from changes to the U.S. federal tax code. These adjustments affect the following financial measures: net revenues, compensation expenses, non-compensation expenses, income tax expense/(benefit), net income/(loss) applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies, earnings/(loss) per diluted common share, return on average common shareholders' equity, segment net revenues, segment operating expenses, segment pre-tax operating income/(loss) and segment pre-tax operating margin. Management believes that presenting these results and measures on an adjusted basis in conjunction with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures provides the most meaningful basis for comparison of its operating results across periods, and enhances the overall understanding of our current financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nExecutive Overview\nStrategic Growth Initiatives - Beginning in 2011, following the financial crisis, we implemented a strategic framework focused on achieving strong results across various markets conditions, sustainable growth and predictability in earnings, as well as expanding operating margin. Our plan focused on increasing the contributions from our higher margin activities (i.e., advisory services and public finance), diversifying the business, managing operating costs diligently, and investing for growth. Through strong execution on these strategic initiatives we have produced a substantial increase in net revenues and remixed the business to higher quality earnings. These favorable attributes have generated greater earnings and enabled us to return capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends, which we initiated in the first quarter of 2017 and subsequently increased going into 2018. Our investments in the business are discussed below.\nOverview of Operations - Our operations are principally engaged in providing investment banking, institutional brokerage, asset management and related financial services to corporations, private equity groups, public entities, non-profit entities and institutional investors in the United States and Europe. We operate through two reportable business segments:\nCapital Markets - The Capital Markets segment provides investment banking services and institutional sales, trading and research services. Investment banking services include management of and participation in underwritings, financial advisory services and public finance activities. Revenues are generated through the receipt of advisory and financing fees. Institutional sales, trading and research services focus on the trading of equity and fixed income products with institutions, government and non-profit entities. Revenues are generated through commissions and sales credits earned on equity and fixed income institutional sales activities, net interest revenues on trading securities held in inventory, and profits and losses from trading these securities. Also, we generate revenue through strategic trading and investing activities, which focus on investments in municipal bonds and U.S. government agency securities. In order to invest firm capital and to manage capital from outside investors, we have created alternative asset management funds in merchant banking that involve equity or debt investments in late stage private companies; senior living, which provides financing to U.S. senior living facilities; and energy, whose principal activity is to invest in oil and gas services companies headquartered in Europe. We receive management and performance fees for managing these funds.\nWe have executed on our strategic growth initiatives through investments in the business, primarily by expanding into new industry sectors within equity investment banking and equity institutional brokerage, and the expansion of our fixed income middle market sales platform. The following is a summary of these activities.\n \u2022 As part of our strategy to expand our equity investment banking business into the energy sector and grow our advisory  business, on February 26, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Simmons & Company International (\"Simmons\"), an employee-owned investment bank and broker dealer focused on the energy industry. For more information on our acquisition of Simmons, see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 In 2015, we built upon our expansion into the financial institutions sector by acquiring the assets of River Branch Holdings LLC (\"River Branch\"), an equity investment banking boutique focused on the financial institutions sector. Also in 2015, we completed the acquisition of BMO Capital Markets GKST Inc. (\"BMO GKST\"), a municipal bond sales, trading and origination business of BMO Financial Corp. \n \u2022 Over the past several years, we have added and strengthened sub-sectors across our industry groups. In equity investment banking, we added healthy living in our consumer sector and strengthened our healthcare sector with biotech and healthcare information technology practices. In addition, we broadened our specialty practices in public finance with additions in senior living and charter schools. \nWe have investment commitments related to affiliated entities which will make direct or indirect debt investments in companies. In 2018, we anticipate that we will begin to underwrite and syndicate loans through these entities.\nAsset Management - The Asset Management segment, which provides traditional asset management services, manages investments in master limited partnerships (\"MLPs\") and energy infrastructure securities focused on the energy sector, and manages assets in domestic and global equity markets. Revenues are generated in the form of management and performance fees. Revenues are also generated through investments in the partnerships and funds that we manage.\nAn explicit element of our strategy in asset management has been to diversify our product offerings through the addition of high quality investment teams. In addition to our core MLP and value equity products, we have added teams specializing in domestic growth equity, global equity, and quantitative strategies, allowing us to leverage the infrastructure of our existing platform.\nIn 2017, our Asset Management segment experienced declining profitability due to decreases in revenues from reduced AUM and higher operating expenses from the addition of new investment teams. In the third quarter of 2017, we identified goodwill impairment indicators necessitating a full impairment testing of goodwill. The interim impairment testing related to our Asset Management segment goodwill resulted in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $114.4 million. For more information on our goodwill impairment testing, please refer to the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" section.\nIn 2016, an extended cycle of investors favoring passive investment vehicles over active management, combined with certain products having investment performance below their benchmarks, reduced management fees for the asset management business and caused a corresponding decline in profitability. Lower average AUM for our MLP strategies, driven by a decline in MLP valuations, also resulted in decreased management fees and profitability. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing, including the goodwill associated with our Asset Management segment, which resulted in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $82.9 million.\nFinancial Highlights\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent Inc/(Dec)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dec. 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>874,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>747,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>617,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-compensation expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,952\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss per diluted common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.07\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>869,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>736,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted compensation and benefits expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>562,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted non-compensation expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income applicable to Piper Jaffray Companies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings per diluted common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M - Not meaningful\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017\n \u2022 Net revenues increased 17.1 percent compared to 2016. Significantly higher advisory services revenues, as well as higher equity financing revenues, were partially offset by lower debt financing, institutional brokerage and asset management revenues. \n \u2022 Compensation and benefits expenses were up 21.0 percent compared to the year-ago period due primarily to increased compensation expenses arising from increased revenues, as well as higher acquisition-related compensation costs related to a performance award plan implemented in conjunction with our acquisition of Simmons. In 2017, we recorded $27.0 million of compensation expense related to this plan, compared to $4.3 million in 2016. The higher compensation costs were due to outperformance of the Simmons business in 2017. \n \u2022 Non-compensation expenses increased 7.1 percent compared to 2016. In 2017, we incurred a $114.4 million goodwill impairment charge, compared to a $82.9 million goodwill impairment charge in 2016. Also, incremental back office conversion costs in the current year were more than offset by lower restructuring costs.

Overall market conditions are a product of many factors, which are beyond our control, often unpredictable and at times inherently volatile. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions, the relative level of volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, changes in interest rates and credit spreads (especially rapid and extreme changes), overall market liquidity, the level and shape of various yield curves, the volume and value of trading in securities, overall equity valuations, and the demand for active asset management services.\nFactors that differentiate our business within the financial services industry also may affect our financial results. For example, our capital markets business focuses on specific industry sectors while serving principally middle-market clientele. If the business environment for our focus sectors is impacted adversely, our business and results of operations could reflect these impacts. In addition, our business, with its specific areas of focus and investment, may not track overall market trends. Given the variability of the capital markets and securities businesses, our earnings may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and results for any individual period should not be considered indicative of future results.\nOutlook for 2018\nWe expect the U.S. economy to continue to grow at a moderate pace in 2018. The recently passed tax reform legislation, increased fiscal spending, actions to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses, and broad growth across most major global economies should be supportive to economic growth in the U.S. Conversely, geopolitical risks or economic instability internationally may pose consequences for the global economy and inject periods of heightened volatility into the U.S. equity and debt markets.\nWe believe that U.S. monetary policy could possibly have a material impact on the economy in 2018. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates three times in 2017 on the expectation of stronger economic growth despite muted signs of inflation. Long-term interest rates, however, have not moved in step with increases in short-term interest rates resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. We anticipate that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to pursue a gradual and steady path to rate normalization, particularly if there is acceleration in the pace of inflation. Higher interest rates could trigger a sell-off in equities which would likely adversely impact our equity capital raising and advisory businesses. Further, if long-term interest rates prove resistant to a tightening in monetary policy, we could experience an extended period of a flat, or even an inverse, yield curve, which could adversely impact our fixed income sales and trading business. In addition, exogenous conditions may trigger episodes of volatility with respect to interest rates. A volatile interest rate environment could manifest itself in changes to the yield curve or relative spreads which may have a mixed impact on certain of our businesses.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\"), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, will have a significant impact on the federal tax code, including a significant corporate federal rate reduction and tax treatment which would facilitate the repatriation of earnings from overseas profits. The lower corporate tax rate will result in additional earnings, which we will use to invest in our business and to return capital to our shareholders through dividends. We will also continue to look for opportunistic investments that are in line with our strategy. Although the full impact of the Tax Reform Act on our businesses is not yet known, we would anticipate that certain sectors of our businesses may be affected more than others. We expect that our public finance operations will be adversely impacted as the repeal of tax-exempt advance refunding bonds through the Tax Reform Act will result in a decline in municipal issuance volume in the market. The impact on our equity investment banking businesses is expected to be favorable, albeit at a moderate level. The Tax Reform Act is not expected to have a significant impact on our institutional brokerage or asset management businesses. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of this legislation on our businesses.\nWe expect conditions in the equity markets to remain conducive to our advisory and equity capital raising activities in 2018. While lower volatility benefits our capital raising business, it has the inverse effect on our equity sales and trading business. We have experienced heightened volatility in early 2018. If we experience sustained bouts of higher volatility or a material market correction, our equity brokerage business may benefit while our advisory and equity capital raising businesses may suffer. We believe our advisory services business will continue to perform well in 2018 on the strength of our market position, long-term investments, diversity in our practice and readily available capital. As noted above, economic instability arising from a significant geopolitical event, for example, or an adverse market reaction to monetary tightening would likely be detrimental to both our equity capital raising and advisory businesses. Advisory services revenues for any given quarter are impacted by the timing and size of the deals closing, which can result in fluctuations in revenues period over period.\nWe expect that secular challenges to our equity brokerage business, including the shift from active to passive managers, will persist in 2018. These challenges may be exacerbated by the implementation of MiFID II, a European regulation which may be adopted by some of our U.S. clients. This regulation, which governs how buyside clients (asset managers) pay for services performed by brokerage businesses, may lead to revenue declines for U.S brokerage businesses, and we would not be immune from this impact.\nWe would expect the low interest rate environment and flat yield curve to persist in 2018. This would continue to subdue customer flow activity for our fixed income institutional brokerage business. While higher interest rates across the yield curve would be favorable to this business, the move to higher rates could adversely impact our public finance business in the short-term as the level of refunding activity eases while greater economic growth has not yet spurred a ramp in new money issuance volumes. Irrespective of the interest rate levels, we believe that municipal debt underwriting activity will be down meaningfully in 2018 compared to 2017 as some issuances were accelerated to the end of 2017 due to pending changes from the tax reform legislation, and also due to a lower level of refunding activity.\nAs economic growth continues we would expect rising market valuations, which would have a positive impact on our asset management business. However, market valuations may be negatively impacted by significant declines and volatility in the financial markets, as experienced in early 2018. We would expect that active asset managers, ourselves included, will remain under pressure to create alpha for their clients and to maintain or grow AUM.\nResults of Operations\nFinancial Summary\nThe
