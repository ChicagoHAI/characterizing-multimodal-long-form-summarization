The following discussion and analysis provides certain information, which the Company's management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company's results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2014. The statements contained in this section that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should\u201d or anticipates\u201d or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in our various filings with the SEC, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of our authorized executive officers.\nThese forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Many important factors affect our ability to achieve our objectives, including, among other things, technological and other developments within a given field, intense and evolving competition, the lack of an established trading market\u201d for our shares, and our ability to obtain additional financing, as well as other risks detailed from time to time in our public disclosure filings with the SEC.\nExecutive Summary\nReferences in this Current Report on Form 10\u00adK to CMG Holdings Group\u201d, CMG\u201d, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d for periods prior to the closing of the Reorganization refer to the Registrant, and for periods subsequent to the closing of the Reorganization refer to the Registrant and its subsidiaries. The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) of the United States of America ( US GAAP\u201d). The Company's objective is to create shareholder value by building market leading strategies that deliver innovative, value added marketing communications and strategic consulting to our clients. The company manages the business by monitoring several financial and non financial performance indicators. The key indicators that we review focus on the areas of revenues and operating expenses. Revenue growth is analyzed by reviewing the components and mix of the growth, including: growth by major geographic location and growth from acquisitions.\nFinancial analysis\nYear ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 Liquidity and capital resources\nAs at December 31, 2015, the Company had a cash balance of $230,138 and working capital deficit of $1,174,641 compared with a cash balance of $27,886 and a working capital deficit of $1,285,378 at December 31, 2014. The decrease in working capital was mainly due to the decrease in business for XA during the second half of 2014.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows used in operating activities was $137,486 compared with use of $2,043,692 of cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities is mainly due the decrease in revenues and operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCash Flows from Investing Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows provided by investing activities were $64,766, compared to $1,260,990 for the year ended December31, 2014.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $0 as compared to $334,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenues\nThe Company had revenues of $1,073,577 in our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $7,811,423 in fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in revenues is mainly due to decrease of business revenues generated in event marketing operations of XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc.\nCost of Sales\nThe Company had cost of sales of revenues of $352,531 in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $6,493,002 in the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in cost of sales is mainly associated to the decrease in event marketing operations of XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc.\nExpenses\nThe Company had total operating expenses of $752,139 in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $2,908,815 in the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in operating expense is mainly due to a decrease in General and Administrative Expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ending December 31, 2014.\nIncome\nThe Company had a net loss of $977 in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net income of $1,268,183 in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCapital Resources\nAt December 31, 2015, we had assets totaling $321,516, compared to $122,978 at December 31, 2014. Assets at December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of cash of $230,138, property and equipment, net of $28,478, goodwill of $54,500 and other current assets of $8,400.\nLiabilities\nOur liabilities at December 31, 2015 totaled $1,413,179, compare to $1,321,664 at December 31, 2014. Liabilities at December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $145,408 in accrued liabilities, $676,670 in accounts payable, $2200,000 in deferred compensation and $371,100 in other short term liabilities including convertible notes and derivative liabilities.\nGoing Concern\nOur independent registered accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Because we have a working capital deficit and recurring net losses, our independent registered accounting firm has included in their report for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, an uncertainty with respect to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFor all periods following closing under the Reorganization Agreement, the Company intends to prepare consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, which will be prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. During the preparation of the financial statements the Company will be required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company will evaluate its estimates and judgments, including those related to sales, returns, pricing concessions, bad debts, inventories, investments, fixed assets, intangible assets, income taxes and other contingencies. The Company intends to base its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under current conditions. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In response to the SEC's Release No. 33\u00ad8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policy,\u201d the Registrant identified the most critical accounting principles upon which its financial status depends. The Registrant determined that those critical accounting principles are related to the use of estimates, revenue recognition, income tax and impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets. The Company presents these accounting policies in the relevant sections in this management's discussion and analysis, including the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenues generated from clients are subject to contracts requiring the Company to provide services within specified time periods generally ranging up to twelve months. As a result, we have projects in process at various stages of completion on any given date and stages may extend from one quarter to the next quarter and from one year to the next year. Revenue for our services is recognized when the following criteria are satisfied: evidence of an arrangement exists\u037e price is agreed upon at a fixed or determinable agreement level\u037e services have been performed and collection is assured. Depending on terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: individual project performances as is such in our event marketing division, monthly base retainers in our public relations, consulting or talent management division, and completed contracts were the Company work is based on success fee of the engagement and paid a percentage of the revenue generated by our clients. Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance or a combinations of each or all three. The revenues and commissions are generally earned on the date of the signing of the contract and then an invoice is distributed to the client with approvals. Our revenue is recorded as gross revenues less cost of goods sold or less pass through expenses charged to a client because there may be various pass through expenses, such as external production and marketing costs.\nIf the Company does not accurately manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time to satisfy our obligations under the contracts, then future profit margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized. Outside production costs consist primarily of costs to purchase media and program merchandise\u037e costs of production\u037e merchandise warehousing and distribution\u037e third party contract fulfillment costs\u037e and other costs directly related to marketing programs. Revenue recognition will not result in related billings throughout the duration of a contract due to timing differences between the contracted billing schedule and the time such revenue is recognized. In such instances, when revenue is recognized in an amount in excess of the contracted billing amount, we record such excess on our balance sheet as un billed contracts in progress. Alternatively, on a scheduled billing date, should the billing amount exceed the amount of revenue recognized, we record such excess on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. In addition, on contracts where reimbursable costs are incurred prior to the time revenue is recognized on such contracts, we record such costs as deferred contract costs on our balance sheet. Notwithstanding this, labor costs for permanent employees are expensed as incurred.\nWe use estimates of fair value to value derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing and able market participants. In general, our policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to model fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads (including for our liabilities), relying first on observable data from active markets. Additional adjustments may be made for factors including liquidity, credit, bid/offer spreads, etc., depending on current market conditions. Transaction costs are not included in the determination of fair value. When possible, we seek to validate the model's output to market transactions.\nITEM 8.

Terry L Johnson, CPA resigned at this time.\nOn April 27, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company ratified and approved the appointment of John Scrudato, CPA as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014 and its engagement agreement dated April 21, 2015 John Scrudato, CPA is located at 7 Valley View Drive Califon, NJ 07830.\nDuring the Company's previous fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 through 2014 and through May 15, 2015, neither the Company nor anyone on the Company's behalf consulted with John Scrudato, CPA regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S\u00adK.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a\u00ad15(e) and 15d\u00ad15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2014. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is identified below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. This conclusion by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer does not relate to reporting periods after December 31, 2015.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 1992). Furthermore, due to our financial situation, the Company will be implementing further internal controls as the Company becomes operative so as to fully comply with the standards set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a\u00ad15(f) and 15d\u00ad15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on its evaluation as of December 31, 2014, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014 due to the identification of a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. At any time, if it appears that any control can be implemented to continue to mitigate such weaknesses, it is immediately implemented. As soon as our finances allow, we will hire sufficient accounting staff and implement appropriate procedures for monitoring and review of work performed by our Chief Financial Officer.\nIn performing this assessment, management has identified the following material weaknesses as of December 31, 2014:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> There is a lack of segregation of duties necessary for a good system of internal control due to insufficient accounting staff due to the size of the Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of reviews\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Employees and management lack the qualifications and training to fulfill their assigned accounting and reporting functions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Inadequate design of controls over significant accounts and processes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Inadequate documentation of the components of internal control in general\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to valuing and recording equity based payments to employees and non employees\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to valuing and recording debt instruments including those with conversion options and the related embedded derivative liabilities\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to evaluating and recording related party transactions\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is not required by current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nPART III\nITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe following table sets forth the name and position of each of our current executive officers and directors. All directors hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until their respective successors are elected, except in the case of death, resignation or removal:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> Name\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Age\n</td> <td> </td> <td> With Company Since\n</td> <td> Director/Position\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Glenn Laken\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> April 7, 2014\n</td> <td> CEO, CFO and Chairman of the Board of Directors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> David J. Kovacs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> January 14, 2014\n</td> <td> Director\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlenn Laken. Over the past 30 years, Mr. Laken has held multiple senior executive positions and created successful growth strategies in the financial services sector. His expansive professional experience includes working as an advisor to the 22 billion dollar Ameritech Pension fund, partnership in a Wall Street specialist firm, ownership of a Chicago clearing house with offices nationwide, and the purchase and restructuring of the Cigarette Racing Team Company. He has also enjoyed success in the area of mergers and acquisitions as an accomplished business leader.\nA Company shareholder since 2010, Mr. Laken organized a shareholder group that forced changes in Company management in 2012, after careful analysis revealed that the Company was failing to reach its potential due to mismanagement by the original management team. Since orchestrating this change, Mr. Laken has worked as Company consultant, introducing Jeffrey Devlin and David Kovacs to the Board, and bringing Ron Burkhardt on as a board member and executive chairman of XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc. ( XA\u201d). He also introduced a new subsidiary partially owned by his wife, Good Gaming Inc., to the Companies portfolio and arranged the sale of Audio Eye, Inc. stock to fund the elimination of the Company's toxic debt.\nDavid J. Kovacs. A veteran of the investment banking and private equity sectors for over 10 years, Mr. Kovacs is currently the head of Investment Banking and Private Equity for Fitch Learning. Mr. Kovacs is also the Managing Director of Private Equity for Strategic Acquisitions, a $2 billion real estate investment firm. Prior to his current roles, Mr. Kovacs focused on private equity as a Managing Director at The Hinduju Group, one of the largest diversified groups in the world with over $50 billion under management. Mr. Kovacs also worked in various capacities at Citigroup and Blackstone Group in their investment banking and private equity divisions.\nWith the addition of Mr. Kovacs to the Board, CMG has acquired one of the most respected and brilliant minds in the world of investment and private equity. As a student at Columbia University and City University (NY), Mr. Kovacs completed his undergraduate degree at age 18, finishing the required coursework in two years and earning a triple major in Finance, Economics and Biochemistry.\nWith his experience in mature and emerging markets as a training specialist in venture capital, investment banking, and private equity, Mr. Kovacs is also a highly coveted speaker. Mr. Kovacs has lectured at over 100 universities, including the majority of Ivy League schools. He was a lead instructor for the Securities & Exchange Commission and has given talks to industry leaders such as Barclays, JP Morgan, RBC, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\nThe wealth of experience and breadth of knowledge that Mr. Kovacs brings to the Board will be invaluable as the Board seeks to enhance current strategies as well as devise new ones to help the company move forward with its current and future initiatives.\nBoard Committees\nWe do not have a standing nominating, compensation or audit committee. Rather, our full board of directors performs the functions of these committees. Also, we do not have an audit committee financial expert\u201d on our board of directors as that term is defined by Item 401(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S\u00adK. We do not believe it is necessary for our board of directors to appoint such committees because the volume of matters that come before our board of directors for consideration permits the directors to give sufficient time and attention to such matters to be involved in all decision making. Additionally, because our Common Stock is not listed for trading or quotation on a national securities exchange, we are not required to have such committees.\nDirector Independence\nOur securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter dealer quotation system which has requirements that directors be independent. We believe that two of our three directors, Jeffrey Devlin and Ronald Burkhardt, would not be considered to be independent, as that term is defined in the listing standards of NASDAQ.\nMeetings of the Board of Directors\nDuring its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the Board of Directors met three times through teleconferencing. In addition, the Board of Directors had otherwise transacted business by unanimous written consents during the year 2013.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nOur Board recognizes that the leadership structure and combination or separation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman roles is driven by the needs of the Company at any point in time. Currently, Mr. Glenn Laken serves as Chairman of our Board as well as the CEO of the Company. We have no policy requiring the combination or separation of leadership roles and our governing documents do not mandate a particular structure. This has allowed, and will continue to allow, our Board the flexibility to establish the most appropriate structure for our company at any given time.\nCode of Ethics\nOur Board of Directors adopted a code of ethics, which was filed as Exhibit 14.1 to the annual report on Form 10K\u00adSB filed on February 20, 2008, and which is incorporated by reference herein. The Code of Ethics applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.\nThe code of ethics address, among other things, honesty and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, regulations and policies, including disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws, confidentiality, trading on inside information, and reporting of violations of the code.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of Section 16(a) forms they file.\nITEM 11.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company was not a party to any transaction (where the amount involved exceeded the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of our assets for the last two fiscal years) in which a director, executive officer, holder of more than five percent of our common stock, or any member of the immediate family of any such person have or will have a direct or indirect material interest and no such transactions are currently proposed.\nThe Company's Board conducts an appropriate review of and oversees all related party transactions on a continuing basis and reviews potential conflict of interest situations where appropriate. The Board has not adopted formal standards to apply when it reviews, approves or ratifies any related party transaction. However, the Board believes that the related party transactions are fair and reasonable to the Company and on terms comparable to those reasonably expected to be agreed to with independent third parties for the same goods and/or services at the time they are authorized by the Board.\nITEM 14.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CMG Holdings Group, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that CMG Holdings Group, Inc. will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 12, the Company had an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2015 and 2014, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year then ended. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 12. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n/s/ Scrudato & Co., PA\nScrudato & Co., PA\nCalifon, New Jersey\nOctober 31, 2016\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> 7 Valley View Drive Califon, New Jersey

Activity\nCreative Management Group, Inc. was formed in Delaware on August 13, 2002 as a limited liability company named Creative Management Group, LLC. On August 7, 2007, this entity converted to a corporation and changed its legal name to Creative Management Group Inc. The Company is a sports, entertainment, marketing and management company providing event management implementation, sponsorships, licensing and broadcast, production and syndication.\nOn February 20, 2008, Creative Management Group, Inc. formed CMG Acquisitions, Inc., a Delaware company, for the purpose of acquiring companies and expansion strategies. On February 20, 2008, Creative Management Group, Inc. acquired 92.6% of Pebble Beach Enterprises, Inc. (a publicly traded company) and changed the name to CMG Holdings Group, Inc. ( the Company\u201d). The purpose of the acquisition was to effect a reverse merger with Pebble Beach Enterprises, Inc. at a later date. On May 27, 2008, Pebble Beach entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with its controlling shareholder, Creative Management Group, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation. Upon closing the eighty shareholders of Creative Management Group delivered all of their equity interests in Creative Management Group to Pebble Beach in exchange for shares of common stock in Pebble Beach owned by Creative Management Group, as a result of which Creative Management Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pebble Beach. The shareholders of Creative Management Group received one share of Pebble Beach's common stock previously owned by Creative Management Group for each issued and outstanding common share owned of Creative Management Group. As a result, the 22,135,148 shares of Pebble Beach that were issued and previously owned by Creative Management Group, are now owned directly by its shareholders. The 22,135,148 shares of Creative Management Group previously owned by its shareholders are now owned by Pebble Beach, thereby making Creative Management Group a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pebble Beach. Pebble Beach did not issue any new shares as part of the Reorganization. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization whereby Creative Management Group is the accounting acquirer. Pebble Beach was renamed CMG Holdings Group, Inc.\nOn April 1, 2009, the Company, through a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary CMGO Capital, Inc., a Nevada corporation, completed the acquisition of XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc. On March 31, 2010, the Company and AudioEye, Inc. ( AudioEye\u201d) completed the final Stock Purchase Agreement under which the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of AudioEye. On June 22, 2011 the Company entered into a Master Agreement subject to shareholder approval as may be required under applicable law and subject to closing conditions with AudioEye Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation where the shareholders of AudioEye Acquisition Corp. exchanged 100% of the stock in AudioEye Acquisition Corp for 80% of the capital stock of AudioEye. The Company retained 15% of AudioEye subject to transfer restrictions in accordance with the Master Agreement; on October 2012, the Company distributed to its shareholders, in the form of a dividend, 5% of the capital stock of AudioEye in accordance with provisions of the Master Agreement.\nOn March 28, 2014, CMG Holdings Group, Inc. (the Company\u201d or CMG\u201d), completed its acquisition of 100% of the shares of Good Gaming, Inc. ( GGI\u201d) by entering into a Share Exchange Agreement (the SEA\u201d) with BMB Financial, Inc. and Jackie Beckford, the then shareholders of GGI. The sole owner of BMB Financial, Inc. is also the sole owner of Infinite Alpha, Inc. which provides consulting services to CMG. Pursuant to the SEA, the Company received 100% of the shares of GGI in exchange for 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, $33,000 in equipment and consultant compensation and a commitment to pay $200,000 in development costs. As of September 30, 2014, the Company has paid $58,600 of equipment and consultant compensation and $190,550 in development costs, of which $50,000 of the development costs had been advanced by the Company, prior to entering the agreement. In addition, pursuant to the SEA, CMG shall adopt an incentive plan for GGI which shall entitle the GGI officers, directors and employees to receive up to 30% of the net profits of GGI and up to 30% of the proceeds, in the event of a sale of GGI or its assets.\nCMG HOLDINGS GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2015\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CMG Holdings Group, Inc., XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc. (\"XA\") and GGI after elimination of all significant inter-company accounts and transactions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Estimates are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation, and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial Institutions - The Company maintains its cash balances at two financial institutions where they are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 each. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, neither of these accounts was in excess of the limit. The Company also maintains a money market investment account at one securities firm where the account is insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation up to $500,000 for the bankruptcy, etc., of the securities firm. At December 31and 2013, the account did not have a balance in excess of the limit.\nSales and Accounts Receivable - For year ended December 31, 2015, one customer accounts for 0%, 93% and 72% of the Company's total revenues, respectively.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\nThe Company earns revenues by providing event management services under individually negotiated contracts with varying terms, recognizing revenue in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been provided and collectability is assured. In arrangements where key indicators suggest the Company acts as principal, the Company records the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as cost of revenues as the services are provided.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are amounts due from event management services, are unsecured and are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Credit is generally extended on a short-term basis and do not bear interest, although a finance charge may be applied to amounts outstanding more than thirty days. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with clients. Provisions for losses on accounts receivable are determined on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. There were no allowances for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation to employees in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 718-10, Stock Compensation ( ASC 718-10\u201d) and share-based compensation to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50 Accounting for Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. ASC 718-10 and 505-50 require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including stock options based on the estimated fair values.\nCMG HOLDINGS GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2015\nDerivative Instruments\nWe generally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow risks or market-risks. However, certain financial instruments, such as warrants and the embedded conversion features of our convertible promissory notes and debentures, which are indexed to our common stock, are classified as liabilities when either (a) the holder possesses rights to net-cash settlement or (b) physical or net-share settlement is not within our control. In such instances, net-cash settlement is assumed for financial accounting and reporting purposes, even when the terms of the underlying contracts do not provide for net-cash settlement. Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded, and continuously carried, at fair value.\nDetermining the fair value of these complex derivative financial instruments involves judgment and the use of certain relevant assumptions including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatility and conversion and redemption privileges. The use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and all derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet.\nThe Company uses estimates of fair value to value its derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing and able market participants. In general, the Company's policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to model fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads (including for the Company's liabilities), relying first on observable data from active markets. Additional adjustments may be made for factors including liquidity, credit, bid/offer spreads, etc., depending on current market conditions. Transaction costs are not included in the determination of fair value. When possible, The Company seeks to validate the model's output to market transactions. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different valuation models could produce materially different fair value estimates. The values presented may not represent future fair values and may not be realizable. The Company categorizes its fair value estimates in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (ASC 820), based on the hierarchical framework associated with the three levels of price transparency utilized in measuring financial instruments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which is generally between three and five years. Depreciation expense was $0 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset, which is three years. Amortization expense was $0 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCMG HOLDINGS GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2015\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nBasic and Diluted Net Loss per Share\nThe Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nASC 820 and ASC 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825), requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives, marketable securities and listed equities.\nLevel 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, options and collars.\nCMG HOLDINGS GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2015\nLevel 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.\nThe Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Pursuant to ASC 820 and 825, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1\u201d inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.\nThe following table sets forth by level with the fair value hierarchy the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Level 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable trading securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Derivative Liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Level 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable trading securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Derivative Liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,892\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,892\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\nThe Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, regarding marketable securities. The Company invests in securities that are intended to be bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term, and as a result, classifies such investments as trading securities. Trading securities are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value being reflected as unrealized gains or losses in the current period. In addition, the Company classifies the cash flows from purchases, sales, and maturities of trading securities as cash flows from operating activities.\nDetails of the Company's marketable trading securities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Aggregate fair value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross unrealized holding gains (losses)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sales ($1,423,491 stocks plus $85,000 options)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross realized gains (stocks and options)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross realized losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other than temporary impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCMG HOLDINGS GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2015\nNOTE 2 - EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nOn January 29, 2014, the Company sold 1,500,000 shares of its common stock for $0.01 per share and net proceeds of $15,000.\nOn March 28, 2014, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to the acquisition of its subsidiary.

Significant assumptions used in the model as of the date the Note was issued and as of September 30, 2014 included an expected life equal to the remaining term of the Note, an expected dividend yield of zero, estimated volatility ranging of 116%, and a risk-free rate of return of 0.13%. For the risk-free rates of return, we use the published yields on zero-coupon Treasury Securities with maturities consistent with the remaining term of the Note. Volatility is based upon our expected common stock price volatility over the remaining term of the Note. The volatility used for the Note is based on the Company's 100-day volatility, which is considered a reasonable surrogate for the volatility to be expected over the life of the Note. That volatility has generally ranged from 116% to 146%.\nNOTE 5 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are subject to certain claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn September 23, 2014, XA filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York against HG and its principals alleging wrongdoing by the defendants in connection with soliciting XA's clients and seeking against further contact with XA clients. The Company conducted an internal investigation of actions taken by XA's former employees during the quarter ended September 30, 2014. While the investigation is not complete, we have discovered that there are numerous instances of conversion of XA assets and funds, such as personal charges on company credit cards, payments for cell phones for family members, reimbursement for personal travel and other expenses which did not relate to XA in any way, and transactions between XA and parties owned by these former employees who did not disclose their interests in them. The Company and XA plan to complete the investigation, including recovering e-mails deleted by the former employees, and to vigorously pursue any and all amounts wrongfully taken from XA.\nIn October, 2014, Ronald Burkhardt, XA,s former Executive Chairman and a current member of the Company's Board of Directors filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleging breach of his employment contract and seeking approximately $695,000 in damages.

The decrease in operating expense is mainly due to a decrease in General and Administrative Expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ending December 31, 2014.\nIncome\nThe Company had a net loss of $977 in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net income of $1,268,183 in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nCapital Resources\nAt December 31, 2015, we had assets totaling $321,516, compared to $122,978 at December 31, 2014. Assets at December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of cash of $230,138, property and equipment, net of $28,478, goodwill of $54,500 and other current assets of $8,400.\nLiabilities\nOur liabilities at December 31, 2015 totaled $1,413,179, compare to $1,321,664 at December 31, 2014. Liabilities at December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $145,408 in accrued liabilities, $676,670 in accounts payable, $2200,000 in deferred compensation and $371,100 in other short term liabilities including convertible notes and derivative liabilities.\nGoing Concern\nOur independent registered accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Because we have a working capital deficit and recurring net losses, our independent registered accounting firm has included in their report for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, an uncertainty with respect to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFor all periods following closing under the Reorganization Agreement, the Company intends to prepare consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, which will be prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. During the preparation of the financial statements the Company will be required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company will evaluate its estimates and judgments, including those related to sales, returns, pricing concessions, bad debts, inventories, investments, fixed assets, intangible assets, income taxes and other contingencies. The Company intends to base its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under current conditions. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In response to the SEC's Release No. 33\u00ad8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policy,\u201d the Registrant identified the most critical accounting principles upon which its financial status depends. The Registrant determined that those critical accounting principles are related to the use of estimates, revenue recognition, income tax and impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets. The Company presents these accounting policies in the relevant sections in this management's discussion and analysis, including the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenues generated from clients are subject to contracts requiring the Company to provide services within specified time periods generally ranging up to twelve months. As a result, we have projects in process at various stages of completion on any given date and stages may extend from one quarter to the next quarter and from one year to the next year. Revenue for our services is recognized when the following criteria are satisfied: evidence of an arrangement exists\u037e price is agreed upon at a fixed or determinable agreement level\u037e services have been performed and collection is assured. Depending on terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: individual project performances as is such in our event marketing division, monthly base retainers in our public relations, consulting or talent management division, and completed contracts were the Company work is based on success fee of the engagement and paid a percentage of the revenue generated by our clients. Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance or a combinations of each or all three. The revenues and commissions are generally earned on the date of the signing of the contract and then an invoice is distributed to the client with approvals. Our revenue is recorded as gross revenues less cost of goods sold or less pass through expenses charged to a client because there may be various pass through expenses, such as external production and marketing costs.\nIf the Company does not accurately manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time to satisfy our obligations under the contracts, then future profit margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized. Outside production costs consist primarily of costs to purchase media and program merchandise\u037e costs of production\u037e merchandise warehousing and distribution\u037e third party contract fulfillment costs\u037e and other costs directly related to marketing programs. Revenue recognition will not result in related billings throughout the duration of a contract due to timing differences between the contracted billing schedule and the time such revenue is recognized. In such instances, when revenue is recognized in an amount in excess of the contracted billing amount, we record such excess on our balance sheet as un billed contracts in progress. Alternatively, on a scheduled billing date, should the billing amount exceed the amount of revenue recognized, we record such excess on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. In addition, on contracts where reimbursable costs are incurred prior to the time revenue is recognized on such contracts, we record such costs as deferred contract costs on our balance sheet. Notwithstanding this, labor costs for permanent employees are expensed as incurred.\nWe use estimates of fair value to value derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing and able market participants. In general, our policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to model fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads (including for our liabilities), relying first on observable data from active markets. Additional adjustments may be made for factors including liquidity, credit, bid/offer spreads, etc., depending on current market conditions. Transaction costs are not included in the determination of fair value. When possible, we seek to validate the model's output to market transactions.\nITEM 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a\u00ad15(e) and 15d\u00ad15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2014. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is identified below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. This conclusion by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer does not relate to reporting periods after December 31, 2015.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 1992). Furthermore, due to our financial situation, the Company will be implementing further internal controls as the Company becomes operative so as to fully comply with the standards set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a\u00ad15(f) and 15d\u00ad15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on its evaluation as of December 31, 2014, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014 due to the identification of a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. At any time, if it appears that any control can be implemented to continue to mitigate such weaknesses, it is immediately implemented. As soon as our finances allow, we will hire sufficient accounting staff and implement appropriate procedures for monitoring and review of work performed by our Chief Financial Officer.\nIn performing this assessment, management has identified the following material weaknesses as of December 31, 2014:\n \u00b7 There is a lack of segregation of duties necessary for a good system of internal control due to insufficient accounting staff due to the size of the Company \n \u00b7 Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of reviews \n \u00b7 Employees and management lack the qualifications and training to fulfill their assigned accounting and reporting functions \n \u00b7 Inadequate design of controls over significant accounts and processes \n \u00b7 Inadequate documentation of the components of internal control in general \n \u00b7 Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to valuing and recording equity based payments to employees and non employees \n \u00b7 Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to valuing and recording debt instruments including those with conversion options and the related embedded derivative liabilities \n \u00b7 Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to evaluating and recording related party transactions \nThe Company is not required by current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nPART III\nITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe following table sets forth the name and position of each of our current executive officers and directors. All directors hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until their respective successors are elected, except in the case of death, resignation or removal:\n\nGlenn Laken. Over the past 30 years, Mr. Laken has held multiple senior executive positions and created successful growth strategies in the financial services sector. His expansive professional experience includes working as an advisor to the 22 billion dollar Ameritech Pension fund, partnership in a Wall Street specialist firm, ownership of a Chicago clearing house with offices nationwide, and the purchase and restructuring of the Cigarette Racing Team Company. He has also enjoyed success in the area of mergers and acquisitions as an accomplished business leader.\nA Company shareholder since 2010, Mr. Laken organized a shareholder group that forced changes in Company management in 2012, after careful analysis revealed that the Company was failing to reach its potential due to mismanagement by the original management team. Since orchestrating this change, Mr. Laken has worked as Company consultant, introducing Jeffrey Devlin and David Kovacs to the Board, and bringing Ron Burkhardt on as a board member and executive chairman of XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc. ( XA\u201d). He also introduced a new subsidiary partially owned by his wife, Good Gaming Inc., to the Companies portfolio and arranged the sale of Audio Eye, Inc. stock to fund the elimination of the Company's toxic debt.\nDavid J. Kovacs. A veteran of the investment banking and private equity sectors for over 10 years, Mr. Kovacs is currently the head of Investment Banking and Private Equity for Fitch Learning. Mr. Kovacs is also the Managing Director of Private Equity for Strategic Acquisitions, a $2 billion real estate investment firm. Prior to his current roles, Mr. Kovacs focused on private equity as a Managing Director at The Hinduju Group, one of the largest diversified groups in the world with over $50 billion under management. Mr. Kovacs also worked in various capacities at Citigroup and Blackstone Group in their investment banking and private equity divisions.\nWith the addition of Mr. Kovacs to the Board, CMG has acquired one of the most respected and brilliant minds in the world of investment and private equity. As a student at Columbia University and City University (NY), Mr. Kovacs completed his undergraduate degree at age 18, finishing the required coursework in two years and earning a triple major in Finance, Economics and Biochemistry.\nWith his experience in mature and emerging markets as a training specialist in venture capital, investment banking, and private equity, Mr. Kovacs is also a highly coveted speaker. Mr. Kovacs has lectured at over 100 universities, including the majority of Ivy League schools. He was a lead instructor for the Securities & Exchange Commission and has given talks to industry leaders such as Barclays, JP Morgan, RBC, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\nThe wealth of experience and breadth of knowledge that Mr. Kovacs brings to the Board will be invaluable as the Board seeks to enhance current strategies as well as devise new ones to help the company move forward with its current and future initiatives.\nBoard Committees\nWe do not have a standing nominating, compensation or audit committee. Rather, our full board of directors performs the functions of these committees. Also, we do not have an audit committee financial expert\u201d on our board of directors as that term is defined by Item 401(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S\u00adK. We do not believe it is necessary for our board of directors to appoint such committees because the volume of matters that come before our board of directors for consideration permits the directors to give sufficient time and attention to such matters to be involved in all decision making. Additionally, because our Common Stock is not listed for trading or quotation on a national securities exchange, we are not required to have such committees.\nDirector Independence\nOur securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter dealer quotation system which has requirements that directors be independent. We believe that two of our three directors, Jeffrey Devlin and Ronald Burkhardt, would not be considered to be independent, as that term is defined in the listing standards of NASDAQ.\nMeetings of the Board of Directors\nDuring its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the Board of Directors met three times through teleconferencing. In addition, the Board of Directors had otherwise transacted business by unanimous written consents during the year 2013.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nOur Board recognizes that the leadership structure and combination or separation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman roles is driven by the needs of the Company at any point in time. Currently, Mr. Glenn Laken serves as Chairman of our Board as well as the CEO of the Company. We have no policy requiring the combination or separation of leadership roles and our governing documents do not mandate a particular structure. This has allowed, and will continue to allow, our Board the flexibility to establish the most appropriate structure for our company at any given time.\nCode of Ethics\nOur Board of Directors adopted a code of ethics, which was filed as Exhibit 14.1 to the annual report on Form 10K\u00adSB filed on February 20, 2008, and which is incorporated by reference herein. The Code of Ethics applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.\nThe code of ethics address, among other things, honesty and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, regulations and policies, including disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws, confidentiality, trading on inside information, and reporting of violations of the code.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of Section 16(a) forms they file.\nITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nThe following table sets forth information concerning cash and non\u00adcash compensation paid by the Company to its CEO and CFO and the CEO of XA during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012.\n\n(1) Mr. Laken was appointed as our CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors on April 30, 2014.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company has not entered into any employment contract with Glenn Laken, the CEO and Chairman of Board of Directors or David Kovacs, acting CFO and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Laken was granted options to purchase forty million (40,000,000) shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.0155 with a term of five years. The Company anticipates entering into an employment agreement with Mr. Laken by April 30, 2014.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End\nThere were no un exercised options, stock that has not vested or equity incentive plan awards for any named executive officer outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plan\nThere were no un exercised options, stock that has not vested or equity incentive plan awards for any named executive officer outstanding as", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included with this Form 10\u00adK. The following discussion and analysis provides certain information, which the Company's management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company's results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2014. The statements contained in this section that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should\u201d or anticipates\u201d or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties.

Such forward looking statements may be included in our various filings with the SEC, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of our authorized executive officers.\nThese forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Many important factors affect our ability to achieve our objectives, including, among other things, technological and other developments within a given field, intense and evolving competition, the lack of an established trading market\u201d for our shares, and our ability to obtain additional financing, as well as other risks detailed from time to time in our public disclosure filings with the SEC.\nExecutive Summary\nReferences in this Current Report on Form 10\u00adK to CMG Holdings Group\u201d, CMG\u201d, the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d for periods prior to the closing of the Reorganization refer to the Registrant, and for periods subsequent to the closing of the Reorganization refer to the Registrant and its subsidiaries.

During the preparation of the financial statements the Company will be required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company will evaluate its estimates and judgments, including those related to sales, returns, pricing concessions, bad debts, inventories, investments, fixed assets, intangible assets, income taxes and other contingencies. The Company intends to base its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under current conditions. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In response to the SEC's Release No. 33\u00ad8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policy,\u201d the Registrant identified the most critical accounting principles upon which its financial status depends. The Registrant determined that those critical accounting principles are related to the use of estimates, revenue recognition, income tax and impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets. The Company presents these accounting policies in the relevant sections in this management's discussion and analysis, including the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenues generated from clients are subject to contracts requiring the Company to provide services within specified time periods generally ranging up to twelve months. As a result, we have projects in process at various stages of completion on any given date and stages may extend from one quarter to the next quarter and from one year to the next year. Revenue for our services is recognized when the following criteria are satisfied: evidence of an arrangement exists\u037e price is agreed upon at a fixed or determinable agreement level\u037e services have been performed and collection is assured. Depending on terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: individual project performances as is such in our event marketing division, monthly base retainers in our public relations, consulting or talent management division, and completed contracts were the Company work is based on success fee of the engagement and paid a percentage of the revenue generated by our clients. Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance or a combinations of each or all three. The revenues and commissions are generally earned on the date of the signing of the contract and then an invoice is distributed to the client with approvals. Our revenue is recorded as gross revenues less cost of goods sold or less pass through expenses charged to a client because there may be various pass through expenses, such as external production and marketing costs.\nIf the Company does not accurately manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time to satisfy our obligations under the contracts, then future profit margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized. Outside production costs consist primarily of costs to purchase media and program merchandise\u037e costs of production\u037e merchandise warehousing and distribution\u037e third party contract fulfillment costs\u037e and other costs directly related to marketing programs. Revenue recognition will not result in related billings throughout the duration of a contract due to timing differences between the contracted billing schedule and the time such revenue is recognized. In such instances, when revenue is recognized in an amount in excess of the contracted billing amount, we record such excess on our balance sheet as un billed contracts in progress. Alternatively, on a scheduled billing date, should the billing amount exceed the amount of revenue recognized, we record such excess on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. In addition, on contracts where reimbursable costs are incurred prior to the time revenue is recognized on such contracts, we record such costs as deferred contract costs on our balance sheet. Notwithstanding this, labor costs for permanent employees are expensed as incurred.\nWe use estimates of fair value to value derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing and able market participants. In general, our policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are used to model fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit spreads (including for our liabilities), relying first on observable data from active markets. Additional adjustments may be made for factors including liquidity, credit, bid/offer spreads, etc., depending on current market conditions. Transaction costs are not included in the determination of fair value. When possible, we seek to validate the model's output to market transactions.\nITEM 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a\u00ad15(e) and 15d\u00ad15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2014. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is identified below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. This conclusion by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer does not relate to reporting periods after December 31, 2015.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 1992). Furthermore, due to our financial situation, the Company will be implementing further internal controls as the Company becomes operative so as to fully comply with the standards set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a\u00ad15(f) and 15d\u00ad15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on its evaluation as of December 31, 2014, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014 due to the identification of a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. At any time, if it appears that any control can be implemented to continue to mitigate such weaknesses, it is immediately implemented. As soon as our finances allow, we will hire sufficient accounting staff and implement appropriate procedures for monitoring and review of work performed by our Chief Financial Officer.\nIn performing this assessment, management has identified the following material weaknesses as of December 31, 2014:\n \u00b7 There is a lack of segregation of duties necessary for a good system of internal control due to insufficient accounting staff due to the size of the Company \n \u00b7 Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of reviews \n \u00b7 Employees and management lack the qualifications and training to fulfill their assigned accounting and reporting functions \n \u00b7 Inadequate design of controls over significant accounts and processes \n \u00b7 Inadequate documentation of the components of internal control in general \n \u00b7 Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to valuing and recording equity based payments to employees and non employees \n \u00b7 Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to valuing and recording debt instruments including those with conversion options and the related embedded derivative liabilities \n \u00b7 Failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to evaluating and recording related party transactions \nThe Company is not required by current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nPART III\nITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe following table sets forth the name and position of each of our current executive officers and directors. All directors hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until their respective successors are elected, except in the case of death, resignation or removal:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> Name\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Age\n</td> <td> </td> <td> With Company Since\n</td> <td> Director/Position\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Glenn Laken\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> April 7, 2014\n</td> <td> CEO, CFO and Chairman of the Board of Directors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> David J. Kovacs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> January 14, 2014\n</td> <td> Director\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlenn Laken. Over the past 30 years, Mr. Laken has held multiple senior executive positions and created successful growth strategies in the financial services sector. His expansive professional experience includes working as an advisor to the 22 billion dollar Ameritech Pension fund, partnership in a Wall Street specialist firm, ownership of a Chicago clearing house with offices nationwide, and the purchase and restructuring of the Cigarette Racing Team Company. He has also enjoyed success in the area of mergers and acquisitions as an accomplished business leader.\nA Company shareholder since 2010, Mr. Laken organized a shareholder group that forced changes in Company management in 2012, after careful analysis revealed that the Company was failing to reach its potential due to mismanagement by the original management team. Since orchestrating this change, Mr. Laken has worked as Company consultant, introducing Jeffrey Devlin and David Kovacs to the Board, and bringing Ron Burkhardt on as a board member and executive chairman of XA, The Experiential Agency, Inc. ( XA\u201d). He also introduced a new subsidiary partially owned by his wife, Good Gaming Inc., to the Companies portfolio and arranged the sale of Audio Eye, Inc. stock to fund the elimination of the Company's toxic debt.\nDavid J. Kovacs. A veteran of the investment banking and private equity sectors for over 10 years, Mr. Kovacs is currently the head of Investment Banking and Private Equity for Fitch Learning. Mr. Kovacs is also the Managing Director of Private Equity for Strategic Acquisitions, a $2 billion real estate investment firm. Prior to his current roles, Mr. Kovacs focused on private equity as a Managing Director at The Hinduju Group, one of the largest diversified groups in the world with over $50 billion under management. Mr. Kovacs also worked in various capacities at Citigroup and Blackstone Group in their investment banking and private equity divisions.\nWith the addition of Mr. Kovacs to the Board, CMG has acquired one of the most respected and brilliant minds in the world of investment and private equity. As a student at Columbia University and City University (NY), Mr. Kovacs completed his undergraduate degree at age 18, finishing the required coursework in two years and earning a triple major in Finance, Economics and Biochemistry.\nWith his experience in mature and emerging markets as a training specialist in venture capital, investment banking, and private equity, Mr. Kovacs is also a highly coveted speaker. Mr. Kovacs has lectured at over 100 universities, including the majority of Ivy League schools. He was a lead instructor for the Securities & Exchange Commission and has given talks to industry leaders such as Barclays, JP Morgan, RBC, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\nThe wealth of experience and breadth of knowledge that Mr. Kovacs brings to the Board will be invaluable as the Board seeks to enhance current strategies as well as devise new ones to help the company move forward with its current and future initiatives.\nBoard Committees\nWe do not have a standing nominating, compensation or audit committee. Rather, our full board of directors performs the functions of these committees. Also, we do not have an audit committee financial expert\u201d on our board of directors as that term is defined by Item 401(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S\u00adK. We do not believe it is necessary for our board of directors to appoint such committees because the volume of matters that come before our board of directors for consideration permits the directors to give sufficient time and attention to such matters to be involved in all decision making. Additionally, because our Common Stock is not listed for trading or quotation on a national securities exchange, we are not required to have such committees.\nDirector Independence\nOur securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter dealer quotation system which has requirements that directors be independent. We believe that two of our three directors, Jeffrey Devlin and Ronald Burkhardt, would not be considered to be independent, as that term is defined in the listing standards of NASDAQ.\nMeetings of the Board of Directors\nDuring its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the Board of Directors met three times through teleconferencing. In addition, the Board of Directors had otherwise transacted business by unanimous written consents during the year 2013.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nOur Board recognizes that the leadership structure and combination or separation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman roles is driven by the needs of the Company at any point in time. Currently, Mr. Glenn Laken serves as Chairman of our Board as well as the CEO of the Company. We have no policy requiring the combination or separation of leadership roles and our governing documents do not mandate a particular structure. This has allowed, and will continue to allow, our Board the flexibility to establish the most appropriate structure for our company at any given time.\nCode of Ethics\nOur Board of Directors adopted a code of ethics, which was filed as Exhibit 14.1 to the annual report on Form 10K\u00adSB filed on February 20, 2008, and which is incorporated by reference herein. The Code of Ethics applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.\nThe code of ethics address, among other things, honesty and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, regulations and policies, including disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws, confidentiality, trading on inside information, and reporting of violations of the code.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of Section 16(a) forms they file.\nITEM 11.
