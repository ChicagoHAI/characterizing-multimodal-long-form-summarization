MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCompany Overview\nWe are an innovator in communications technologies and services, focused on making connectivity accessible, available and secure for all. Our end-to-end platform of high-capacity Ka-band satellites, ground infrastructure and user terminals enables us to provide cost-effective, high-speed, high-quality broadband solutions to enterprises, consumers and government users around the globe, whether on the ground, in the air or at sea. In addition, our government business includes a market-leading portfolio of military tactical data link systems, satellite communication products and services and cybersecurity and information assurance products and services. Our product, system and service offerings are often linked through common underlying technologies, customer applications and market relationships. We believe that our portfolio of products and services, combined with our vertical integration strategy and ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial applications and segments as well as across different geographic markets, provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies.\nWe conduct our business through three segments: satellite services, commercial networks and government systems.\nAcquisitions\nOn April 30, 2021, subsequent to fiscal year end, we purchased the remaining 51% interest in Euro Infrastructure Co. from Eutelsat for approximately \u20ac142.6 million, or approximately $172.7 million (subject to customary post-closing net working capital and net debt adjustments). The purchase price was funded with available cash, resulting in a cash outlay of approximately \u20ac41.6 million, or $50.4 million, net of approximately \u20ac101.0 million, or $122.3 million, of Euro Infrastructure Co.'s cash on hand.\nOn April 30, 2021, subsequent to fiscal year end, we acquired RigNet in exchange for the issuance of approximately 4.0 million shares of our common stock and a de minimis amount of cash in respect of fractional shares. RigNet is a leading provider of ultra-secure, intelligent networking solutions and specialized applications.\nGiven the timing of the closing of these acquisitions, we are currently in the process of valuing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in each of the business combinations. Therefore, we are not yet able to provide the amounts to be recognized for the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and other disclosures required by ASC 805, Business Combinations. We will disclose this and other related information in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2021.\nPrivate Placement\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,474,559 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $39.11 per share to certain accredited investors in a private placement transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $174.7 million after deducting offering expenses.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government. The COVID-19 pandemic and attempts to contain it, such as mandatory closures, shelter-in-place\u201d orders and travel restrictions, have caused significant disruptions and adverse effects on U.S. and global economies, including impacts to supply chains, customer demand and financial markets. We have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and to work with our customers, employees, suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers and communities to address the disruptions from the pandemic. Although our financial results for the year ended March 31, 2021 were impacted by the pandemic, the impact was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in such period, with negative impacts particularly in our commercial aviation business offset by strong demand in our fixed broadband services business and other parts of our business. We continue to expect our diversified businesses to provide resiliency as we enter fiscal year 2022.\nOur government systems segment, which represented 47% and 49% of our total revenues during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, continued to perform in line with our expectations. Demand for products and services in our government systems segment remained strong despite the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, although our government business experienced some administrative delays on certain contractual vehicles as government customers continue to adjust to the challenges inherent in the remote work environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, through the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced increased demand for our premium high-speed plans in our fixed broadband services business, reflecting customers' increased bandwidth needs in a remote working/distance schooling environment. However, the pandemic also caused a severe decline in global air traffic during fiscal year 2021, which reduced demand for our in-flight services and IFC systems in our satellite services and commercial networks segments, respectively. While current global airline traffic is still a fraction of the activity in fiscal year 2020, domestic airline traffic is showing signs of improvement. As a result, our in-flight services business showed modest improvement in the quarter ended March 31, 2021 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2020 with increased planes in service and passenger volumes. We expect to continue to see negative impacts on revenues and operating cash flows from our IFC businesses in fiscal year 2022 and potentially beyond, but for the effects to continue to lessen over time with increases in passenger air traffic and the return to service of additional currently inactive aircraft. In each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, less than 10% of our total revenues were generated by services and products provided to commercial airlines reported in our satellite services and commercial networks segments.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business in fiscal year 2022 and potentially beyond will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of the public health emergency, the extent, duration and effectiveness of containment actions taken, the speed and extent of vaccination programs, the extent of disruption to important global, regional and local supply chains and economic markets, and the impact of the pandemic on overall supply and demand, global air travel, consumer confidence, discretionary spending levels and levels of economic activity.\nSatellite Services\nOur satellite services segment uses our proprietary technology platform to provide satellite-based high-speed broadband services around the globe for use in commercial applications. Our proprietary Ka-band satellites are at the core of our technology platform. The primary services offered by our satellite services segment are comprised of:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fixed broadband services, which provide consumers and businesses with high-speed, high-quality broadband internet access and VoIP services, primarily in the United States but also in various countries in Europe and Latin America.

We anticipate that approximately 1,190 additional commercial aircraft under existing customer agreements with commercial airlines will be put into service with our IFC systems. However, the timing of installation and entry into service for additional aircraft under existing customer agreements may be delayed due to COVID-19 impacts. Additionally, due to the nature of commercial airline contracts, there can be no assurance that anticipated IFC services will be activated on all such additional commercial aircraft. See the section entitled COVID-19\u201d above for a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our in-flight services business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Community Internet services, which offer innovative, affordable, satellite-based connectivity in communities with poor or no other means of internet access.

Fixed-price contracts (which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price) comprised approximately 89%, 88% and 90% of our total revenues for these segments for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The remainder of our revenues in these segments for such periods was derived primarily from cost-reimbursement contracts (under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract, plus a fee or profit) and from time-and-materials contracts (which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract, plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services).\nOur ability to grow and maintain our revenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments has to date depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution, and our ability to obtain additional sizable contract awards. Due to the nature of this process, it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our revenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments has been derived from customer contracts that include the development of products. The development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer's specific requirements and, accordingly, expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding (which includes a profit component) is included in revenues. Revenues for our funded development from our customer contracts were approximately 23%, 24% and 19% of our total revenues during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe also incur IR&D expenses, which are not directly funded by a third party. IR&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, supplies, prototype materials, testing and certification related to R&D projects. IR&D expenses were approximately 5%, 6% and 6% of total revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a government contractor, we are able to recover a portion of our IR&D expenses pursuant to our government contracts.\nApproximately 9%, 11% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were derived from international sales. Doing business internationally creates additional risks related to global political and economic conditions and other factors identified under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment.\nRevenue recognition\nWe apply the five-step revenue recognition model under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (commonly referred to as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606) to our contracts with our customers. Under this model, we (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify our performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price for the contract, (4) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations. These performance obligations generally include the purchase of services (including broadband capacity and the leasing of broadband equipment), the purchase of products, and the development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts.\nThe timing of satisfaction of performance obligations may require judgment. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts with customers for services, primarily consisting of connectivity services. These contracts typically require advance or recurring monthly payments by the customer. Our obligation to provide connectivity services is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The measure of progress over time is based upon either a period of time (e.g., over the estimated contractual term) or usage (e.g., bandwidth used/bytes of data processed). We evaluate whether broadband equipment provided to our customer as part of the delivery of connectivity services represents a lease in accordance with ASC 842. As discussed in Note 1 - The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies - Leases to our consolidated financial statements, for broadband equipment leased to fixed broadband customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we account for the lease and non-lease components of connectivity services arrangement as a single performance obligation as the connectivity services represent the predominant component.\nWe also derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with customers to provide products. Performance obligations to provide products are satisfied at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. These contracts typically require payment by the customer upon passage of control and determining the point at which control is transferred may require judgment. To identify the point at which control is transferred to the customer, we consider indicators that include, but are not limited to, whether (1) we have the present right to payment for the asset, (2) the customer has legal title to the asset, (3) physical possession of the asset has been transferred to the customer, (4) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and (5) the customer has accepted the asset. For product revenues, control generally passes to the customer upon delivery of goods to the customer.\nThe vast majority of our revenues from long-term contracts to develop and deliver complex equipment built to customer specifications are derived from contracts with the U.S. Government (including foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. Government). Our contracts with the U.S. Government typically are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments based on a percentage of the costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer can often retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables on the balance sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For our U.S. Government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our actual costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. Government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. We recognize a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues on the balance sheet. An advance payment is not typically considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.\nPerformance obligations related to developing and delivering complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts are recognized over time as these performance obligations do not create assets with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance to date. To measure the transfer of control, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Estimating the total costs at completion of a performance obligation requires management to make estimates related to items such as subcontractor performance, material costs and availability, labor costs and productivity and the costs of overhead. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined. A one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed-price contracts as of March 31, 2021 would change our income before income taxes by an insignificant amount.\nThe evaluation of transaction price, including the amounts allocated to performance obligations, may require significant judgments. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue, and where applicable the cost at completion, is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Our contracts may contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions, including the potential for significant financing components, that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These amounts, which are sometimes variable, can be dictated by performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, the timing of payments, and customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. In the event an agreement includes embedded financing components, we recognize interest expense or interest income on the embedded financing components using the effective interest method. This methodology uses an implied interest rate which reflects the incremental borrowing rate which would be expected to be obtained in a separate financing transaction. We have elected the practical expedient not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\nIf a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimating standalone selling prices may require judgment. When available, we utilize the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price by considering all information (including market conditions, specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available.\nDeferred costs to obtain or fulfill contract\nUnder ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, we recognize an asset from the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect to recover those costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that we incur to obtain a contract with a customer that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. ASC 340-40 also requires the recognition of an asset from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract when (1) the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify, (2) the costs generate or enhance our resources that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future, and (3) the costs are expected to be recovered. We recognize an asset related to commission costs incurred primarily in our satellite services segment and recognize an asset related to costs incurred to fulfill contracts. Costs to acquire customer contracts are amortized over the estimated customer contract life. Costs to fulfill customer contracts are amortized in proportion to the revenue to which the costs relate. For contracts with an estimated amortization period of less than one year, we expense incremental costs immediately.\nWarranty reserves\nWe provide limited warranties on our products for periods of up to five years. We record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products or they are included in long-term construction contracts based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs. Amounts expected to be incurred within 12 months are classified as accrued liabilities and amounts expected to be incurred beyond 12 months are classified as other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. For mature products, we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product. For newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs, we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failures that may occur. It is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience, and, in that case, we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation.\nProperty, equipment and satellites\nSatellites and other property and equipment are recorded at cost or in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired, the fair value at the date of acquisition, net of accumulated depreciation. Capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch, including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentive payments expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers (dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites), costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction, and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. We also construct earth stations, network operations systems and other assets to support our satellites, and those construction costs, including interest, are capitalized as incurred. At the time satellites are placed in service, we estimate the useful life of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite's performance against the original manufacturer's orbital design life, estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates, as well as historical satellite operating trends. We periodically review the remaining estimated useful life of our satellites to determine if revisions to the estimated useful lives are necessary.\nWe own three satellites in service over North America (ViaSat-2, ViaSat-1 and WildBlue-1) and, after acquiring the remaining interest in Euro Infrastructure Co. subsequent to fiscal year end, we also own the KA-SAT satellite over EMEA. In addition, we have lifetime leases of Ka-band capacity on two satellites. We also have a global constellation of three third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites under construction. In addition, we own related earth stations and networking equipment for all of our satellites. Property, equipment and satellites, net also includes the customer premise equipment units leased to subscribers under a retail leasing program as part of our satellite services segment.\nLeases\nFor contracts entered into on or after April 1, 2019, we assess at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, we determine that a lease exists when (1) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) we obtain the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset, and (3) we have the right to direct the use of the asset. A lease is classified as a finance lease when one or more of the following criteria are met: (1)\nthe lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (2) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, (4) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset or (5) the asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria.\nAt the lease commencement date, we recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using an estimate of our incremental borrowing rate for a collateralized loan with the same term as the underlying leases.\nLease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities consist of (1) fixed lease payments for the noncancelable lease term, (2) fixed lease payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised, and (3) variable lease payments that depend on an underlying index or rate, based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Certain of our real estate lease agreements require variable lease payments that do not depend on an underlying index or rate established at lease commencement. Such payments and changes in payments based on a rate or index are recognized in operating expenses when incurred.\nLease expense for operating leases consists of the fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable lease payments as incurred. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the depreciation of assets obtained under finance leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense on the lease liability based on the discount rate at lease commencement. For both operating and finance leases, lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.\nFor broadband equipment leased to fixed broadband customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we have made an accounting policy election not to separate the broadband equipment from the related connectivity services. The connectivity services are the predominant component of these arrangements. The connectivity services are accounted for in accordance ASC 606. We are also a lessor for certain insignificant communications equipment. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\nImpairment of long-lived and other long-term assets (property, equipment and satellites, and other assets, including goodwill)\nIn accordance with the authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (ASC 360), we assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets, including property, equipment and satellites and other assets, when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset (or group of assets) are less than the asset's carrying value. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. No material impairments were recorded by us for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nWe account for our goodwill under the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets (ASC 350) and the provisions of ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which we early adopted in fiscal year 2020. Current authoritative guidance allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying value, we conclude that no impairment exists. Alternatively, if we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, then we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test to identify both the existence of an impairment and the amount of impairment loss, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist.\nIn accordance with ASC 350, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The qualitative analysis includes assessing the impact of changes in certain factors including: (1) changes in forecasted operating results and comparing actual results to projections, (2) changes in the industry or our competitive environment\nsince the acquisition date, (3) changes in the overall economy, our market share and market interest rates since the acquisition date, (4) trends in the stock price and related market capitalization and enterprise values, (5) trends in peer companies' total enterprise value metrics, and (6) additional factors such as management turnover, changes in regulation and changes in litigation matters.\nBased on our qualitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of March 31, 2021, and therefore, determined it was not necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nIncome taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets\nManagement evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to determine if the weight of available evidence suggests that an additional valuation allowance is needed. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes (ASC 740), net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on all the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event that our estimate of taxable income is less than that required to utilize the full amount of any deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is established, which would cause a decrease to income in the period such determination is made. Our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased from $42.6 million at March 31, 2020 to $47.1 million at March 31, 2021. The valuation allowance relates to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, state R&D tax credit carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards.\nOur analysis of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets considered historical as well as forecasted future operating results. In addition, our evaluation considered other factors, including our contractual backlog, our history of positive earnings, current earnings trends assuming our satellite services segment continues to grow, taxable income adjusted for certain items, and forecasted income by jurisdiction. We also considered the period over which these net deferred tax assets can be realized and our history of not having federal tax loss carryforwards expire unused.\nAccruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes (ASC 740). Under the authoritative guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The authoritative guidance addresses the derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business, there are calculations and transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income tax provision. We believe we have adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal, state and foreign tax authorities. However, if these provided amounts prove to be more than what is necessary, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine that provision for the liabilities is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, an additional charge to expense would result.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents, as a percentage of total

The cost of product revenue decrease was mainly due to decreased revenues, causing a $92.4 million decrease in cost of product revenues on a constant margin basis, mainly from revenue decreases in our government systems and commercial networks segments. The decrease in cost of product revenues was partially offset by lower margins, primarily driven by our mobile broadband satellite communication systems products in our commercial networks segment and our government mobile broadband products and tactical data link products in our government systems segment. The cost of service revenue increase primarily related to increased revenues from our fixed broadband services business, partially offset by improved margins in our fixed broadband services business, reflecting the strength of the low variable costs structure of our fixed broadband services business as the business continues to scale.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 512.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 523.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $10.8 million decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a decrease in selling costs of $13.4 million and a decrease in bid and proposal costs of $6.6 million, partially offset by an increase in support costs of $9.2 million. The decrease in selling costs was mainly driven by our satellite services segment, but was reflected across all three segments. The decrease in bid and proposal costs was mainly from our government systems segment. The increase in support costs reflected increases across all three segments. SG&A expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs and expenses for business development, marketing and sales, bid and proposal, facilities, finance, contract administration and general management.\nIndependent research and development\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Independent research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 115.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 130.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $14.6 million decrease in IR&D expenses was mainly the result of a decrease of $16.7 million in IR&D efforts in our commercial networks segment (primarily related to next-generation satellite payload technologies and mobile broadband satellite communication systems).\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\nWe amortize our acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to ten years. The $2.1 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily the result of certain acquired intangibles in our satellite services segment becoming fully amortized during the prior fiscal year. Expected amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for each of the following periods is as follows:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected for fiscal year 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected for fiscal year 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected for fiscal year 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected for fiscal year 2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected for fiscal year 2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income\nThe $1.2 million decrease in interest income for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily the result of lower interest rates during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020.\nInterest expense\nThe $6.0 million decrease in interest expense in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized compared to the prior year period. This decrease in interest expense was partially offset by the addition of interest expense related to the 2028 Notes, which were issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nIncome taxes\nThe income tax provision in fiscal year 2021 primarily reflected the tax expense from our income before income taxes, the tax expense for tax deficiencies upon settlement of stock-based compensation during the period, and non-deductible compensation, partially offset by benefit from federal and state R&D tax credits. The income tax benefit in fiscal\nyear 2020 primarily reflected the tax benefit from federal and state R&D tax credits, partially offset by the tax expense from our income before income taxes.\nSegment Results for Fiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nSatellite services segment\nRevenues\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment product revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 868.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 826.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 868.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 826.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur satellite services segment revenues increased by $42.4 million due to an increase in service revenues. The increase in service revenues was primarily driven by higher ARPU in the United States in our fixed broadband business when compared to the prior year period, partially offset by a decrease in service revenues from our in-flight services. The increase in ARPU reflected a higher mix of new and existing subscribers choosing Viasat's premium highest speed plans. The in-flight service revenue decrease was driven primarily by an 8% decrease in the number of commercial aircraft using in-flight services through our IFC systems as of year end as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our fiscal year 2021 in-flight service revenues were impacted by the reductions in passenger air traffic and the number of inactive installed aircraft, as well as lower capacity on active installed aircraft as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSegment operating profit\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of segment revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $28.8 million increase in our satellite services segment operating profit was driven primarily by higher earnings contributions of $24.4 million, mainly due to increased revenues, with significant flow through resulting in improved margins, reflecting the strength of the low variable costs structure of our fixed broadband services business as the business continues to scale. The increase in operating profit was also driven by lower selling costs.

The decrease in product revenues was partially offset by an increase of $10.1 million in cybersecurity and information assurance products and a $3.8 million increase in tactical data link products. Our government systems segment continued to show some impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has somewhat complicated product manufacturing and shipments, but new government systems segment awards remained very strong through the end of the fiscal year. The service revenue increase was primarily due to a $20.4 million increase in government mobile broadband services, a $5.2 million increase in tactical data link services, a $4.8 million increase in government satellite communication systems services, a $2.5 million increase in cybersecurity and information assurance services and a $2.2 million increase in tactical satcom radio services. In the second half of fiscal year 2021, we experienced higher usage demand for our services across all major government customer verticals.\nSegment operating profit\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 208.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 225.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of segment revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $17.3 million decrease in our government systems segment operating profit was primarily due to lower earnings contributions of $19.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in revenues and lower margins from our government mobile broadband products and higher IR&D investments, partially offset by SG&A expense management resulting in lower costs of $3.6 million.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.\nBacklog\nAs reflected in the table below, our overall firm and funded backlog increased during fiscal year 2021.\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nMarch 31, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nMarch 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Firm backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Satellite services segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 633.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 611.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial networks segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 733.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 408.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government systems segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 939.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 851.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,306.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,870.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funded backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Satellite services segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 633.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 611.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial networks segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 639.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 408.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government systems segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 846.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 858.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,120.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,878.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe firm backlog does not include contract options. Of the $2.3 billion in firm backlog, a little over half is expected to be delivered during the next twelve months, with the balance delivered thereafter. We include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders, and not anticipated purchase orders and requests. In our satellite services segment, our backlog includes fixed broadband service revenues under our subscriber agreements, but does not include future recurring IFC service revenues under our agreements with commercial airlines. As of March 31, 2021, our IFC systems were installed and in service on approximately 1,480 commercial aircraft, of which, due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 200 were inactive at fiscal year end. While current global airline traffic is still a fraction of the activity in fiscal year 2020, domestic airline traffic is showing signs of improvement. As a result, our in-flight services business showed modest improvement in the quarter ended March 31, 2021, with increased planes in service and passenger volumes. We expect the negative impact on our IFC business from the pandemic to continue into fiscal year 2022 and potentially beyond due to the severe decline in global air traffic and associated grounding of installed aircraft, but to lessen over time with increases in passenger air traffic. We anticipate that approximately 1,190 additional commercial aircraft under existing customer agreements with commercial airlines will be put into service with our IFC systems. However, the timing of installation and entry into service of IFC systems on additional aircraft under existing customer agreements may be delayed as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global airline industry. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that all anticipated purchase orders and requests will be placed or that anticipated IFC services will be activated.\nOur total new awards exclude future revenue under recurring consumer commitment arrangements and were approximately $2.7 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nBacklog is not necessarily indicative of future sales. A majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer. Orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery, and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties. In addition, purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development. A failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related contract.\nFirm backlog amounts are comprised of funded and unfunded components. Funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts. Unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods. Our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long-term contracts on a periodic basis. Our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts. Although we do not control the funding of our contracts, our experience indicates that actual contract funding has ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations, bank line of credit financing, debt financing, export credit agency financing and equity financing. At March 31, 2021, we had $295.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $282.8 million in working capital, and no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of $673.7 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. On July 23, 2020, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,474,559 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $39.11 per share to certain accredited investors in a private placement transaction\nexempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $174.7 million after deducting offering expenses. At March 31, 2020, we had $304.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $441.1 million in working capital, and $390.0 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of $292.7 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. We invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short-term, highly liquid bank money market accounts.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including the timing and amount of cash required for our satellite projects and any future broadband satellite projects we may engage in, expansion of our R&D and marketing efforts, and the nature and timing of orders. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in complementary businesses, products and technologies which may require the use of cash or additional financing.\nThe general cash needs of our satellite services, commercial networks and government systems segments can vary significantly. The cash needs of our satellite services segment tend to be driven by the timing and amount of capital expenditures (e.g., payments under satellite construction and launch contracts and investments in ground infrastructure roll-out), investments in joint ventures, strategic partnering arrangements and network expansion activities, as well as the quality of customer, type of contract and payment terms. In our commercial networks segment, cash needs tend to be driven primarily by the type and mix of contracts in backlog, the nature and quality of customers, the timing and amount of investments in IR&D activities (including with respect to next-generation satellite payload technologies) and the payment terms of customers (including whether advance payments are made or customer financing is required). In our government systems segment, the primary factors determining cash needs tend to be the type and mix of contracts in backlog (e.g., product or service, development or production) and timing of payments (including restrictions on the timing of cash payments under U.S. Government procurement regulations). Other factors affecting the cash needs of our commercial networks and government systems segments include contract duration and program performance. For example, if a program is performing well and meeting its contractual requirements, then its cash flow requirements are usually lower.\nTo further enhance our liquidity position or to finance the construction and launch of any future satellites, acquisitions, strategic partnering arrangements, joint ventures or other business investment initiatives, we may obtain additional financing, which could consist of debt, convertible debt or equity financing from public and/or private credit and capital markets. In February 2019, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC for the future sale of an unlimited amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants and rights. The securities may be offered from time to time, separately or together, directly by us, by selling security holders, or through underwriters, dealers or agents at amounts, prices, interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering.\nTo date, COVID-19 has not had a significant impact on our liquidity, cash flows or capital resources. However, we have taken measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial position, including deferring certain capital expenditures, reducing discretionary expenditures and undertaking cost-reduction actions. Given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated from operations, borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility of $673.7 million, cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to experience, any material issues with liquidity. Although we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, we believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities along with availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nCash flows\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2021 was $727.2 million compared to $436.9 million for fiscal year 2020. This $290.3 million increase was primarily driven by a $229.0 million year-over-year decrease in cash used to fund net operating assets and our operating results (net income adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash changes) which resulted in $61.3 million of higher cash provided by operating activities year-over-year. The decrease in cash used to fund net operating assets during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to an increase in cash inflows year-over-year from combined billed and unbilled accounts receivable, net, attributable to the timing of contractual milestones for certain larger development programs in our government systems segment as well as revenue decreases in our mobile broadband satellite communication systems products and services business in our commercial networks and satellite services segments due to decreased IFC terminal deliveries resulting from the severe decline in global air traffic and resulting downturn in the commercial aviation market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in our collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues included in accrued liabilities due to the timing of milestone billings for certain larger development projects in our commercial networks and government systems segments.\nCash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2021 was $885.3 million compared to $758.8 million for fiscal year 2020. This $126.5 million increase in cash used in investing activities year-over year reflects an increase of approximately $118.8 million in cash used for satellite construction.\nCash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2021 was $149.7 million compared to $365.2 million for fiscal year 2020. This $215.5 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities year-over-year reflects proceeds from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of $420.0 million in fiscal year 2020 and an increase in payments on borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of $360.0 million year-over-year. This decrease was partially offset by $400.0 million of gross proceeds from our 2028 Notes in June 2020 and $174.7 million of net proceeds from a private placement of common stock in July 2020 (after deducting offering expenses). Cash provided by financing activities for both periods included cash received from employee stock purchase plan purchases and the repurchase of common stock related to net share settlement of certain employee tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards.\nSatellite-related activities\nIn connection with the development of any new generation satellite design, and the launch of any new satellite and the commencement of the related service, we expect to incur additional operating costs that negatively impact our financial results. For example, when ViaSat-2 was placed in service in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, this resulted in additional operating costs in our satellite services segment during the ramp-up period prior to service launch and in the fiscal year following service launch. These increased operating costs included depreciation, amortization of capitalized software development, earth station connectivity, marketing and advertising costs, logistics, customer care and various support systems. In addition, interest expense increased during fiscal year 2019 as we no longer capitalized the interest expense relating to the debt incurred for the construction of ViaSat-2 and the related gateway and networking equipment once the satellite was in service. As services using the new satellite scaled, however, our revenue base for broadband services expanded and we gained operating cost efficiencies, which together yielded incremental segment earnings contributions. We anticipate that we will incur a similar cycle of increased operating costs as we prepare for and launch commercial services on future satellites, including our ViaSat-3 constellation, followed by increases in revenue base and in scale. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in significantly increasing revenues or achieving or maintaining operating profit in our satellite services segment, and any such gains may also be offset by investments in our global business.\nWe currently have three ViaSat-3 class satellites under construction. We have entered into satellite construction agreements with Boeing for their construction and purchase and the integration of our payload and technologies into the satellites. In addition, we have entered into various other satellite-related purchase commitments, including with respect to the provision of launch services, satellite operation and satellite insurance. See Note 12 - Commitments to our consolidated financial statements for information as of March 31, 2021 regarding our future minimum payments under our satellite construction contracts and other satellite-related purchase commitments for the next five fiscal years and thereafter. In addition, we will continue to incur costs related to the roll-out of related earth station infrastructure to support the ViaSat-3 constellation, the amount of which will depend, among other matters, on the timing of roll-out and method used to procure fiber access. We believe we have adequate sources of funding for the ViaSat-3 constellation, which include, but are not limited to, our cash on hand, borrowing capacity and the cash we expect to generate from operations over the next few years. Our total cash funding may be reduced through various third-party agreements, including potential joint service offerings and other strategic partnering arrangements.\nOur IR&D investments are expected to continue through fiscal year 2022 and beyond relating to next generation satellite network solutions and support of our government and commercial air mobility businesses. We expect to continue to invest in IR&D at a significant level as we continue our focus on leadership and innovation in satellite and space technologies. However, the level of investment in a given fiscal year will depend on a variety of factors, including the stage of development of our satellite projects, new market opportunities and our overall operating performance. Our total capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 are expected to be higher than fiscal year 2021, as we have a third ViaSat-3 class satellite under construction, as well as increased ground network investments related to international expansion.\nLong-Term Debt\nAs of March 31, 2021, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $1.9 billion, which was comprised of $700.0 million in principal amount of 2025 Notes, $600.0 million in principal amount of 2027 Notes, $400.0 million in principal amount of 2028 Notes, no outstanding borrowings under our $700.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, $98.3 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our Ex-Im Credit Facility with a maturity date of October 15, 2025 and $56.3 million of finance lease obligations.

During the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with subcontractors, contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. We also enter into agreements and purchase commitments with suppliers for the construction, launch, and operation of our satellites. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Consequently, only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable and unconditional commitments.\nOur consolidated balance sheets included $137.4 million and $120.9 million of other liabilities\u201d as of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, respectively, which primarily consisted of the long-term portion of deferred revenues, the long-term portion of our satellite performance incentive obligations relating to the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites and our long-term warranty obligations. With the exception of the long-term portion of our satellite performance incentive obligations relating to the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites (which is included under Satellite performance incentives\u201d), these remaining liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and/or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain.

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCompany Overview\nWe are an innovator in communications technologies and services, focused on making connectivity accessible, available and secure for all. Our end-to-end platform of high-capacity Ka-band satellites, ground infrastructure and user terminals enables us to provide cost-effective, high-speed, high-quality broadband solutions to enterprises, consumers and government users around the globe, whether on the ground, in the air or at sea. In addition, our government business includes a market-leading portfolio of military tactical data link systems, satellite communication products and services and cybersecurity and information assurance products and services. Our product, system and service offerings are often linked through common underlying technologies, customer applications and market relationships. We believe that our portfolio of products and services, combined with our vertical integration strategy and ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial applications and segments as well as across different geographic markets, provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies.\nWe conduct our business through three segments: satellite services, commercial networks and government systems.\nAcquisitions\nOn April 30, 2021, subsequent to fiscal year end, we purchased the remaining 51% interest in Euro Infrastructure Co. from Eutelsat for approximately \u20ac142.6 million, or approximately $172.7 million (subject to customary post-closing net working capital and net debt adjustments). The purchase price was funded with available cash, resulting in a cash outlay of approximately \u20ac41.6 million, or $50.4 million, net of approximately \u20ac101.0 million, or $122.3 million, of Euro Infrastructure Co.'s cash on hand.\nOn April 30, 2021, subsequent to fiscal year end, we acquired RigNet in exchange for the issuance of approximately 4.0 million shares of our common stock and a de minimis amount of cash in respect of fractional shares. RigNet is a leading provider of ultra-secure, intelligent networking solutions and specialized applications.\nGiven the timing of the closing of these acquisitions, we are currently in the process of valuing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in each of the business combinations. Therefore, we are not yet able to provide the amounts to be recognized for the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and other disclosures required by ASC 805, Business Combinations. We will disclose this and other related information in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2021.\nPrivate Placement\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,474,559 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $39.11 per share to certain accredited investors in a private placement transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $174.7 million after deducting offering expenses.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government. The COVID-19 pandemic and attempts to contain it, such as mandatory closures, shelter-in-place\u201d orders and travel restrictions, have caused significant disruptions and adverse effects on U.S. and global economies, including impacts to supply chains, customer demand and financial markets. We have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and to work with our customers, employees, suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers and communities to address the disruptions from the pandemic. Although our financial results for the year ended March 31, 2021 were impacted by the pandemic, the impact was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in such period, with negative impacts particularly in our commercial aviation business offset by strong demand in our fixed broadband services business and other parts of our business. We continue to expect our diversified businesses to provide resiliency as we enter fiscal year 2022.\nOur government systems segment, which represented 47% and 49% of our total revenues during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, continued to perform in line with our expectations. Demand for products and services in our government systems segment remained strong despite the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, although our government business experienced some administrative delays on certain contractual vehicles as government customers continue to adjust to the challenges inherent in the remote work environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, through the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced increased demand for our premium high-speed plans in our fixed broadband services business, reflecting customers' increased bandwidth needs in a remote working/distance schooling environment. However, the pandemic also caused a severe decline in global air traffic during fiscal year 2021, which reduced demand for our in-flight services and IFC systems in our satellite services and commercial networks segments, respectively. While current global airline traffic is still a fraction of the activity in fiscal year 2020, domestic airline traffic is showing signs of improvement. As a result, our in-flight services business showed modest improvement in the quarter ended March 31, 2021 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2020 with increased planes in service and passenger volumes. We expect to continue to see negative impacts on revenues and operating cash flows from our IFC businesses in fiscal year 2022 and potentially beyond, but for the effects to continue to lessen over time with increases in passenger air traffic and the return to service of additional currently inactive aircraft. In each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, less than 10% of our total revenues were generated by services and products provided to commercial airlines reported in our satellite services and commercial networks segments.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business in fiscal year 2022 and potentially beyond will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of the public health emergency, the extent, duration and effectiveness of containment actions taken, the speed and extent of vaccination programs, the extent of disruption to important global, regional and local supply chains and economic markets, and the impact of the pandemic on overall supply and demand, global air travel, consumer confidence, discretionary spending levels and levels of economic activity.\nSatellite Services\nOur satellite services segment uses our proprietary technology platform to provide satellite-based high-speed broadband services around the globe for use in commercial applications. Our proprietary Ka-band satellites are at the core of our technology platform. The primary services offered by our satellite services segment are comprised of:\n \u2022 Fixed broadband services, which provide consumers and businesses with high-speed, high-quality broadband internet access and VoIP services, primarily in the United States but also in various countries in Europe and Latin America. As of March 31, 2021, we provided fixed broadband services to approximately 590,000 U.S. subscribers. \n \u2022 In-flight services, which provide industry-leading IFC, W-IFE and aviation software services. As of March 31, 2021, our IFC systems were installed and in service on approximately 1,480 commercial aircraft, of which, due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 200 were inactive at fiscal year end. We anticipate that approximately 1,190 additional commercial aircraft under existing customer agreements with commercial airlines will be put into service with our IFC systems. However, the timing of installation and entry into service for additional aircraft under existing customer agreements may be delayed due to COVID-19 impacts. Additionally, due to the nature of commercial airline contracts, there can be no assurance that anticipated IFC services will be activated on all such additional commercial aircraft. See the section entitled COVID-19\u201d above for a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our in-flight services business. \n \u2022 Community Internet services, which offer innovative, affordable, satellite-based connectivity in communities with poor or no other means of internet access. The services help foster digital inclusion by enabling millions of people to connect to affordable high-quality internet services via a centralized community hotspot connected to the internet via satellite. Our Community Internet services are currently offered in Mexico, and we are trialing services in advance of full commercial launch in other countries, including Brazil, Guatemala and Nigeria. \n \u2022 Other mobile broadband services, which include high-speed, satellite-based internet services to seagoing vessels (such as energy offshore vessels, cruise ships, consumer ferries and yachts), as well as L-band managed services enabling real-time machine-to-machine (M2M) position tracking, management of remote assets and operations, and visibility into critical areas of the supply chain. \n \u2022 Advanced software and communication infrastructure services, which include ultra-secure solutions spanning global IP connectivity, bandwidth-optimized over-the-top applications, industrial Internet-of-Things big data enablement and industry-leading machine learning analytics. These services support the full evolution of digital enablement, and primarily result from our acquisition of RigNet subsequent to fiscal year end. \nThe assets and results of operations of Euro Infrastructure Co. and RigNet, which were acquired subsequent to fiscal year end (see discussion above), will primarily be included in our satellite services segment (with insignificant amounts included in our commercial networks segment), commencing with the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nCommercial Networks\nOur commercial networks segment develops and sells a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products, antenna systems and terminal solutions that support or enable the provision of high-speed fixed and mobile broadband services. The primary products, systems, solutions and services offered by our commercial networks segment are comprised of:\n \u2022 Mobile broadband satellite communication systems, designed for use in aircraft, seagoing vessels and land-mobile systems. \n \u2022 Fixed broadband satellite communication systems, including next-generation satellite network infrastructure and ground terminals. \n \u2022 Antenna systems, including state-of-the-art ground and airborne terminals, antennas and gateways for terrestrial and satellite customer applications, mobile satellite communication, Ka-band earth stations and other multi-band antennas. \n \u2022 Satellite networking development, including specialized design and technology services covering all aspects of satellite communication system architecture and technology. \n \u2022 Space systems, including the design and development of high-capacity Ka-band satellites and associated payload technologies for our own satellite fleet as well as for third parties. \nGovernment Systems\nOur government systems segment offers a broad array of products and services designed to enable the collection and transmission of secure real-time digital information and communications between fixed and mobile command centers, intelligence and defense platforms and individuals in the field. The primary products and services of our government systems segment include:\n \u2022 Government mobile broadband products and services, which provide military and government users with high-speed, real-time, broadband and multimedia connectivity in key regions of the world, as well as line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight ISR missions. \n \u2022 Government satellite communication systems, which offer an array of portable, mobile and fixed broadband modems, terminals, network access control systems and antenna systems, and include products designed for manpacks, aircraft, UAVs, seagoing vessels, ground-mobile vehicles and fixed applications. \n \u2022 Secure networking, cybersecurity and information assurance products and services, which provide advanced, high-speed IP-based Type 1\u201d and HAIPE-compliant encryption solutions that enable military and government users to communicate information securely over networks, and that protect the integrity of data stored on computers and storage devices. \n \u2022 Tactical data links, including our BATS-D handheld Link 16 radios, our STT 2-channel radios for manned and unmanned applications, disposable\u201d defense data links, and our MIDS and MIDS-JTRS terminals for military fighter jets. \nSources of Revenues\nOur satellite services segment revenues are primarily derived from our fixed broadband services and in-flight services.\nRevenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments are primarily derived from three types of contracts: fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Fixed-price contracts (which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price) comprised approximately 89%, 88% and 90% of our total revenues for these segments for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The remainder of our revenues in these segments for such periods was derived primarily from cost-reimbursement contracts (under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract, plus a fee or profit) and from time-and-materials contracts (which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract, plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services).\nOur ability to grow and maintain our revenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments has to date depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution, and our ability to obtain additional sizable contract awards. Due to the nature of this process, it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our revenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments has been derived from customer contracts that include the development of products. The development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer's specific requirements and, accordingly, expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding (which includes a profit component) is included in revenues. Revenues for our funded development from our customer contracts were approximately 23%, 24% and 19% of our total revenues during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe also incur IR&D expenses, which are not directly funded by a third party. IR&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, supplies, prototype materials, testing and certification related to R&D projects. IR&D expenses were approximately 5%, 6% and 6% of total revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a government contractor, we are able to recover a portion of our IR&D expenses pursuant to our government contracts.\nApproximately 9%, 11% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were derived from international sales. Doing business internationally creates additional risks related to global political and economic conditions and other factors identified under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment.\nRevenue recognition\nWe apply the five-step revenue recognition model under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (commonly referred to as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606) to our contracts with our customers. Under this model, we (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify our performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price for the contract, (4) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations. These performance obligations generally include the purchase of services (including broadband capacity and the leasing of broadband equipment), the purchase of products, and the development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts.\nThe timing of satisfaction of performance obligations may require judgment. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts with customers for services, primarily consisting of connectivity services. These contracts typically require advance or recurring monthly payments by the customer. Our obligation to provide connectivity services is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The measure of progress over time is based upon either a period of time (e.g., over the estimated contractual term) or usage (e.g., bandwidth used/bytes of data processed). We evaluate whether broadband equipment provided to our customer as part of the delivery of connectivity services represents a lease in accordance with ASC 842. As discussed in Note 1 - The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies - Leases to our consolidated financial statements, for broadband equipment leased to fixed broadband customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we account for the lease and non-lease components of connectivity services arrangement as a single performance obligation as the connectivity services represent the predominant component.\nWe also derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with customers to provide products. Performance obligations to provide products are satisfied at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. These contracts typically require payment by the customer upon passage of control and determining the point at which control is transferred may require judgment. To identify the point at which control is transferred to the customer, we consider indicators that include, but are not limited to, whether (1) we have the present right to payment for the asset, (2) the customer has legal title to the asset, (3) physical possession of the asset has been transferred to the customer, (4) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and (5) the customer has accepted the asset. For product revenues, control generally passes to the customer upon delivery of goods to the customer.\nThe vast majority of our revenues from long-term contracts to develop and deliver complex equipment built to customer specifications are derived from contracts with the U.S. Government (including foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. Government). Our contracts with the U.S. Government typically are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments based on a percentage of the costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer can often retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables on the balance sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For our U.S. Government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our actual costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. Government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. We recognize a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues on the balance sheet. An advance payment is not typically considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.\nPerformance obligations related to developing and delivering complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts are recognized over time as these performance obligations do not create assets with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance to date. To measure the transfer of control, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Estimating the total costs at completion of a performance obligation requires management to make estimates related to items such as subcontractor performance, material costs and availability, labor costs and productivity and the costs of overhead. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined. A one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed-price contracts as of March 31, 2021 would change our income before income taxes by an insignificant amount.\nThe evaluation of transaction price, including the amounts allocated to performance obligations, may require significant judgments. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue, and where applicable the cost at completion, is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Our contracts may contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions, including the potential for significant financing components, that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These amounts, which are sometimes variable, can be dictated by performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, the timing of payments, and customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. In the event an agreement includes embedded financing components, we recognize interest expense or interest income on the embedded financing components using the effective interest method. This methodology uses an implied interest rate which reflects the incremental borrowing rate which would be expected to be obtained in a separate financing transaction. We have elected the practical expedient not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\nIf a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimating standalone selling prices may require judgment. When available, we utilize the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price by considering all information (including market conditions, specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available.\nDeferred costs to obtain or fulfill contract\nUnder ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, we recognize an asset from the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect to recover those costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that we incur to obtain a contract with a customer that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. ASC 340-40 also requires the recognition of an asset from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract when (1) the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify, (2) the costs generate or enhance our resources that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future, and (3) the costs are expected to be recovered. We recognize an asset related to commission costs incurred primarily in our satellite services segment and recognize an asset related to costs incurred to fulfill contracts. Costs to acquire customer contracts are amortized over the estimated customer contract life. Costs to fulfill customer contracts are amortized in proportion to the revenue to which the costs relate. For contracts with an estimated amortization period of less than one year, we expense incremental costs immediately.\nWarranty reserves\nWe provide limited warranties on our products for periods of up to five years. We record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products or they are included in long-term construction contracts based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs. Amounts expected to be incurred within 12 months are classified as accrued liabilities and amounts expected to be incurred beyond 12 months are classified as other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. For mature products, we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product. For newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs, we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failures that may occur. It is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience, and, in that case, we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation.\nProperty, equipment and satellites\nSatellites and other property and equipment are recorded at cost or in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired, the fair value at the date of acquisition, net of accumulated depreciation. Capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch, including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentive payments expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers (dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites), costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction, and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. We also construct earth stations, network operations systems and other assets to support our satellites, and those construction costs, including interest, are capitalized as incurred. At the time satellites are placed in service, we estimate the useful life of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite's performance against the original manufacturer's orbital design life, estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates, as well as historical satellite operating trends. We periodically review the remaining estimated useful life of our satellites to determine if revisions to the estimated useful lives are necessary.\nWe own three satellites in service over North America (ViaSat-2, ViaSat-1 and WildBlue-1) and, after acquiring the remaining interest in Euro Infrastructure Co. subsequent to fiscal year end, we also own the KA-SAT satellite over EMEA. In addition, we have lifetime leases of Ka-band capacity on two satellites. We also have a global constellation of three third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites under construction. In addition, we own related earth stations and networking equipment for all of our satellites. Property, equipment and satellites, net also includes the customer premise equipment units leased to subscribers under a retail leasing program as part of our satellite services segment.\nLeases\nFor contracts entered into on or after April 1, 2019, we assess at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, we determine that a lease exists when (1) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) we obtain the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset, and (3) we have the right to direct the use of the asset. A lease is classified as a finance lease when one or more of the following criteria are met: (1)\nthe lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (2) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, (4) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset or (5) the asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria.\nAt the lease commencement date, we recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCompany Overview\nWe are an innovator in communications technologies and services, focused on making connectivity accessible, available and secure for all. Our end-to-end platform of high-capacity Ka-band satellites, ground infrastructure and user terminals enables us to provide cost-effective, high-speed, high-quality broadband solutions to enterprises, consumers and government users around the globe, whether on the ground, in the air or at sea. In addition, our government business includes a market-leading portfolio of military tactical data link systems, satellite communication products and services and cybersecurity and information assurance products and services. Our product, system and service offerings are often linked through common underlying technologies, customer applications and market relationships. We believe that our portfolio of products and services, combined with our vertical integration strategy and ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial applications and segments as well as across different geographic markets, provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies.\nWe conduct our business through three segments: satellite services, commercial networks and government systems.\nAcquisitions\nOn April 30, 2021, subsequent to fiscal year end, we purchased the remaining 51% interest in Euro Infrastructure Co. from Eutelsat for approximately \u20ac142.6 million, or approximately $172.7 million (subject to customary post-closing net working capital and net debt adjustments). The purchase price was funded with available cash, resulting in a cash outlay of approximately \u20ac41.6 million, or $50.4 million, net of approximately \u20ac101.0 million, or $122.3 million, of Euro Infrastructure Co.'s cash on hand.\nOn April 30, 2021, subsequent to fiscal year end, we acquired RigNet in exchange for the issuance of approximately 4.0 million shares of our common stock and a de minimis amount of cash in respect of fractional shares. RigNet is a leading provider of ultra-secure, intelligent networking solutions and specialized applications.\nGiven the timing of the closing of these acquisitions, we are currently in the process of valuing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in each of the business combinations. Therefore, we are not yet able to provide the amounts to be recognized for the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and other disclosures required by ASC 805, Business Combinations. We will disclose this and other related information in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2021.\nPrivate Placement\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,474,559 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $39.11 per share to certain accredited investors in a private placement transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $174.7 million after deducting offering expenses.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government. The COVID-19 pandemic and attempts to contain it, such as mandatory closures, shelter-in-place\u201d orders and travel restrictions, have caused significant disruptions and adverse effects on U.S. and global economies, including impacts to supply chains, customer demand and financial markets. We have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and to work with our customers, employees, suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers and communities to address the disruptions from the pandemic. Although our financial results for the year ended March 31, 2021 were impacted by the pandemic, the impact was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in such period, with negative impacts particularly in our commercial aviation business offset by strong demand in our fixed broadband services business and other parts of our business. We continue to expect our diversified businesses to provide resiliency as we enter fiscal year 2022.\nOur government systems segment, which represented 47% and 49% of our total revenues during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, continued to perform in line with our expectations. Demand for products and services in our government systems segment remained strong despite the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, although our government business experienced some administrative delays on certain contractual vehicles as government customers continue to adjust to the challenges inherent in the remote work environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, through the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced increased demand for our premium high-speed plans in our fixed broadband services business, reflecting customers' increased bandwidth needs in a remote working/distance schooling environment. However, the pandemic also caused a severe decline in global air traffic during fiscal year 2021, which reduced demand for our in-flight services and IFC systems in our satellite services and commercial networks segments, respectively. While current global airline traffic is still a fraction of the activity in fiscal year 2020, domestic airline traffic is showing signs of improvement. As a result, our in-flight services business showed modest improvement in the quarter ended March 31, 2021 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2020 with increased planes in service and passenger volumes. We expect to continue to see negative impacts on revenues and operating cash flows from our IFC businesses in fiscal year 2022 and potentially beyond, but for the effects to continue to lessen over time with increases in passenger air traffic and the return to service of additional currently inactive aircraft. In each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, less than 10% of our total revenues were generated by services and products provided to commercial airlines reported in our satellite services and commercial networks segments.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business in fiscal year 2022 and potentially beyond will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of the public health emergency, the extent, duration and effectiveness of containment actions taken, the speed and extent of vaccination programs, the extent of disruption to important global, regional and local supply chains and economic markets, and the impact of the pandemic on overall supply and demand, global air travel, consumer confidence, discretionary spending levels and levels of economic activity.\nSatellite Services\nOur satellite services segment uses our proprietary technology platform to provide satellite-based high-speed broadband services around the globe for use in commercial applications. Our proprietary Ka-band satellites are at the core of our technology platform. The primary services offered by our satellite services segment are comprised of:\n \u2022 Fixed broadband services, which provide consumers and businesses with high-speed, high-quality broadband internet access and VoIP services, primarily in the United States but also in various countries in Europe and Latin America. As of March 31, 2021, we provided fixed broadband services to approximately 590,000 U.S. subscribers. \n \u2022 In-flight services, which provide industry-leading IFC, W-IFE and aviation software services. As of March 31, 2021, our IFC systems were installed and in service on approximately 1,480 commercial aircraft, of which, due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 200 were inactive at fiscal year end. We anticipate that approximately 1,190 additional commercial aircraft under existing customer agreements with commercial airlines will be put into service with our IFC systems. However, the timing of installation and entry into service for additional aircraft under existing customer agreements may be delayed due to COVID-19 impacts. Additionally, due to the nature of commercial airline contracts, there can be no assurance that anticipated IFC services will be activated on all such additional commercial aircraft. See the section entitled COVID-19\u201d above for a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our in-flight services business. \n \u2022 Community Internet services, which offer innovative, affordable, satellite-based connectivity in communities with poor or no other means of internet access.

Fixed-price contracts (which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price) comprised approximately 89%, 88% and 90% of our total revenues for these segments for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The remainder of our revenues in these segments for such periods was derived primarily from cost-reimbursement contracts (under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract, plus a fee or profit) and from time-and-materials contracts (which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract, plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services).\nOur ability to grow and maintain our revenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments has to date depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution, and our ability to obtain additional sizable contract awards. Due to the nature of this process, it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our revenues in our commercial networks and government systems segments has been derived from customer contracts that include the development of products. The development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer's specific requirements and, accordingly, expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding (which includes a profit component) is included in revenues. Revenues for our funded development from our customer contracts were approximately 23%, 24% and 19% of our total revenues during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe also incur IR&D expenses, which are not directly funded by a third party. IR&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, supplies, prototype materials, testing and certification related to R&D projects. IR&D expenses were approximately 5%, 6% and 6% of total revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a government contractor, we are able to recover a portion of our IR&D expenses pursuant to our government contracts.\nApproximately 9%, 11% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were derived from international sales. Doing business internationally creates additional risks related to global political and economic conditions and other factors identified under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment.\nRevenue recognition\nWe apply the five-step revenue recognition model under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (commonly referred to as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606) to our contracts with our customers. Under this model, we (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify our performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price for the contract, (4) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations. These performance obligations generally include the purchase of services (including broadband capacity and the leasing of broadband equipment), the purchase of products, and the development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts.\nThe timing of satisfaction of performance obligations may require judgment. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts with customers for services, primarily consisting of connectivity services. These contracts typically require advance or recurring monthly payments by the customer. Our obligation to provide connectivity services is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The measure of progress over time is based upon either a period of time (e.g., over the estimated contractual term) or usage (e.g., bandwidth used/bytes of data processed). We evaluate whether broadband equipment provided to our customer as part of the delivery of connectivity services represents a lease in accordance with ASC 842. As discussed in Note 1 - The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies - Leases to our consolidated financial statements, for broadband equipment leased to fixed broadband customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we account for the lease and non-lease components of connectivity services arrangement as a single performance obligation as the connectivity services represent the predominant component.\nWe also derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with customers to provide products. Performance obligations to provide products are satisfied at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. These contracts typically require payment by the customer upon passage of control and determining the point at which control is transferred may require judgment. To identify the point at which control is transferred to the customer, we consider indicators that include, but are not limited to, whether (1) we have the present right to payment for the asset, (2) the customer has legal title to the asset, (3) physical possession of the asset has been transferred to the customer, (4) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and (5) the customer has accepted the asset. For product revenues, control generally passes to the customer upon delivery of goods to the customer.\nThe vast majority of our revenues from long-term contracts to develop and deliver complex equipment built to customer specifications are derived from contracts with the U.S. Government (including foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. Government). Our contracts with the U.S. Government typically are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments based on a percentage of the costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer can often retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables on the balance sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For our U.S. Government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our actual costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. Government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. We recognize a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues on the balance sheet. An advance payment is not typically considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.\nPerformance obligations related to developing and delivering complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts are recognized over time as these performance obligations do not create assets with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance to date. To measure the transfer of control, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Estimating the total costs at completion of a performance obligation requires management to make estimates related to items such as subcontractor performance, material costs and availability, labor costs and productivity and the costs of overhead. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined. A one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed-price contracts as of March 31, 2021 would change our income before income taxes by an insignificant amount.\nThe evaluation of transaction price, including the amounts allocated to performance obligations, may require significant judgments. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue, and where applicable the cost at completion, is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Our contracts may contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions, including the potential for significant financing components, that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These amounts, which are sometimes variable, can be dictated by performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, the timing of payments, and customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. In the event an agreement includes embedded financing components, we recognize interest expense or interest income on the embedded financing components using the effective interest method. This methodology uses an implied interest rate which reflects the incremental borrowing rate which would be expected to be obtained in a separate financing transaction. We have elected the practical expedient not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\nIf a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimating standalone selling prices may require judgment. When available, we utilize the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price by considering all information (including market conditions, specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available.\nDeferred costs to obtain or fulfill contract\nUnder ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, we recognize an asset from the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect to recover those costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that we incur to obtain a contract with a customer that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. ASC 340-40 also requires the recognition of an asset from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract when (1) the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify, (2) the costs generate or enhance our resources that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future, and (3) the costs are expected to be recovered. We recognize an asset related to commission costs incurred primarily in our satellite services segment and recognize an asset related to costs incurred to fulfill contracts. Costs to acquire customer contracts are amortized over the estimated customer contract life. Costs to fulfill customer contracts are amortized in proportion to the revenue to which the costs relate. For contracts with an estimated amortization period of less than one year, we expense incremental costs immediately.\nWarranty reserves\nWe provide limited warranties on our products for periods of up to five years. We record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products or they are included in long-term construction contracts based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs. Amounts expected to be incurred within 12 months are classified as accrued liabilities and amounts expected to be incurred beyond 12 months are classified as other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. For mature products, we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product. For newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs, we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failures that may occur. It is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience, and, in that case, we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation.\nProperty, equipment and satellites\nSatellites and other property and equipment are recorded at cost or in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired, the fair value at the date of acquisition, net of accumulated depreciation. Capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch, including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentive payments expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers (dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites), costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction, and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. We also construct earth stations, network operations systems and other assets to support our satellites, and those construction costs, including interest, are capitalized as incurred. At the time satellites are placed in service, we estimate the useful life of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite's performance against the original manufacturer's orbital design life, estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates, as well as historical satellite operating trends. We periodically review the remaining estimated useful life of our satellites to determine if revisions to the estimated useful lives are necessary.\nWe own three satellites in service over North America (ViaSat-2, ViaSat-1 and WildBlue-1) and, after acquiring the remaining interest in Euro Infrastructure Co. subsequent to fiscal year end, we also own the KA-SAT satellite over EMEA. In addition, we have lifetime leases of Ka-band capacity on two satellites. We also have a global constellation of three third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites under construction. In addition, we own related earth stations and networking equipment for all of our satellites. Property, equipment and satellites, net also includes the customer premise equipment units leased to subscribers under a retail leasing program as part of our satellite services segment.\nLeases\nFor contracts entered into on or after April 1, 2019, we assess at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, we determine that a lease exists when (1) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) we obtain the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset, and (3) we have the right to direct the use of the asset. A lease is classified as a finance lease when one or more of the following criteria are met: (1)\nthe lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (2) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, (4) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset or (5) the asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria.\nAt the lease commencement date, we recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability"
