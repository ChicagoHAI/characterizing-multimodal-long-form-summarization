Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nThis discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K, and the other statistical data provided in this Form 10-K.\nGeneral Overview of the Company's Activities and Risks\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans and investments and the interest expense we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on these balances.\nOur operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges and fees and gains and losses on the sales of securities and loans, our provision for loan losses and non-interest expenses which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional services, advertising and other general and administrative expenses.\nFinancial institutions like us, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are principally concentrated in the Western New York area, and our operations and earnings are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations are also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact the Company.\nTo operate successfully, we must manage various types of risk, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational and information technology risks, strategic risk, reputation risk and compliance risk. A significant form of market risk for the Company is interest rate risk, as the Company's assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. Net interest income is our primary source of revenue and interest rate risk is a significant non-credit related risk to which our Company is exposed. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of our assets and liabilities. In addition to directly impacting net interest income, changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers and debt issuers to repay loans and debt securities, the volume of loan repayments and refinancings, the flow and mix of deposits and the fair value of available for sale securities.\nIn recent years, the Company has adjusted its strategies to manage interest rate risk by originating a greater volume of shorter-term, adjustable rate commercial real estate and commercial business loans and increasing its concentration of core deposits, which are less interest rate sensitive. The Company has entered into two interest rate swap arrangements with a total notional amount of $6.0 million to convert a portion of its fixed rate residential, one- to four-family real estate loans into adjustable rate interest-earning assets, to better manage its exposure to movements in interest rates. The Asset and Liability Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk and the Asset and Liability Committee meets at least quarterly to review the interest rate risk position.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCredit risk is also a significant form of risk for the Company. Credit risk is the risk to our earnings and stockholders' equity that results from customers, to whom loans have been made, and from issuers of debt securities in which the Company has invested, failing to repay their obligations. The magnitude of risk depends on the capacity and willingness of borrowers and debt issuers to repay and the sufficiency of the value of collateral obtained to secure the loans made or investments purchased. This risk is managed by policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors, review of compliance with the policies and periodic reporting and evaluation of loans or securities that are non-performing or demonstrate other characteristics of potential loss.\n\ufeff\nCOVID-19 Risks\nAs noted in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d), which was originally identified in Wuhan, China, rapidly spread to a number of countries around the world, including the United States during 2020. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020. In the United States, the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus invoked various Federal and State, including New York State, authorities to make emergency declarations and issue executive orders to limit the spread of the disease. This included restrictions on travel, business operations, public gatherings, school closings, and mandates to close non-essential businesses.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted the level of economic activity in the Bank's market areas during 2020. Since May 2020, some of the above-noted restrictions have been relaxed, resulting in certain industries being able to re-open for business, with appropriate health measures and social distancing protocols put in place. The initial, current and ongoing restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, including among others, those in the travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, and have resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees in the market areas in which we operate.\nIn light of the changing economic outlook as a result of COVID-19, as well as other factors, the 10-year Treasury yield had fallen to historic lows during 2020, and the equity markets have been significantly impacted and remain volatile. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the Federal government signed the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 into law, which included direct financial aid to American families and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors through programs like the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) and Main Street Lending Program ( MSLP\u201d). The Federal Reserve's actions, actions of federal and state governments, and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our interest income and, therefore, our earnings, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, economic uncertainties have arisen which are likely to negatively impact our borrowers' ability to repay their loans. As discussed elsewhere in this report, the Company significantly increased its provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 and believes its total reserve is adequate. Other financial impacts could occur though such potential impact is unknown at this time.\n\ufeff\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain, cannot be predicted and will depend, among other things, on the duration of the pandemic, the actions undertaken by national, state and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or mitigate its effects, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines that have been developed and the ability of pharmaceutical companies and governments to manufacture and distribute those vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Bank's capital was in excess of regulatory requirements. While management believes we have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, our regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by further credit losses. The Company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity which could be used to support capital ratios.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nManagement Strategy\nOur Reputation. Our primary management strategy has been to maintain our position as an authentic community bank, locally headquartered in Western New York, with nearly 130 years of service to our community. Our management team strives to accomplish this goal by continuing to emphasize our exceptional individualized customer service and financial strength, continued community involvement, effective risk management, strong capital levels, technological services and penetration in our market areas via organic growth of loans and deposits.\nBranding and Marketing. We currently operate eleven full-service branch offices throughout Western New York, where our branch teams initiate and develop both consumer and commercial customer relationships in and around the surrounding market areas. We offer concierge banking services, together with our online and mobile customer conveniences, creating a truly individualized approach for customers to manage their finances whenever, wherever and however they wish. As a true local bank, we pride ourselves on offering competitive products delivered with the individualized service our customers have come to expect. Our experienced team of commercial bankers can meet the needs of nearly any type of business through a variety of checking and credit products, and banking services. The retail banking team located in our branch offices focuses on meeting the deposit and lending needs of all consumers through-out various life stages. Our team members live and work right here in our Western New York communities and can fully understand the specific challenges and opportunities our customers face daily. As the banking industry continues to rapidly evolve in terms of technological conveniences, we remain proactive in our efforts to provide e-banking services that our customers expect. From local decision-making, responding quickly and efficiently to customer needs, and utilizing technology to level the playing field with our competitors, we are committed to developing long-term relationships with our customers. Staying true to our local roots and mission of Putting People First\u201d continues to uniquely position us as a bank of choice in Western New York.\nTechnology. An important strategic objective is to continue to evaluate and enhance the technology supporting our customer service. We are committed to making investments in technology and we believe that it represents an efficient way to deploy a portion of our capital. To this end, the Company has developed a five year plan for the implementation of cost effective and efficient digital services to meet our customer's technology needs, to focus on attracting new customers, and to improve our operational efficiencies. Although we remain committed to expanding our retail branch footprint whenever it makes strategic sense, we will be concentrating our near term efforts on expanding our digital footprint. As part of this initiative, we plan to convert a portion of our banking systems to a new provider in the third quarter of 2021, which will improve our ability to efficiently serve our customers and will provide our customers with updated e-banking services for their convenience.\nOur People. A large part of our success is related to customer service and customer satisfaction. Having employees who understand and value our clientele and their business is a key component to our success. We believe that our present staff is one of our competitive strengths, and thus the retention of such persons and our ability to continue to attract quality personnel is a high priority.\n\ufeff\nLending. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio with emphasis on the origination of short-term adjustable rate commercial real estate, commercial business and home equity loans, while maintaining strong underwriting and asset quality.\n\ufeff\nDue to the interest rate risk inherent in holding long-term, fixed rate one- to four-family real estate loans in our portfolio, we have been strategically focused on increasing the originations of commercial real estate loans to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of developed real estate. We have also focused on commercial business lending to small businesses, including business installment loans, lines of credit and other commercial loans. These types of commercial loans are generally made at higher interest rates and for shorter terms than one- to four-family real estate loans, which reduces the Bank's interest rate risk. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our commercial real estate loan portfolio (including loans to finance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe construction of commercial real estate) represented the largest holdings in our loan portfolio at 54.4% and 51.6%, respectively, of total loans.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, residential one- to four-family mortgage loans (including loans to finance the construction of one- to four-family homes) represented the second largest holding in our loan portfolio at 28.6% and 32.8%, respectively. We may sell low-yielding long-term conforming fixed rate one- to four-family residential loans that we originate on the secondary market, as part of our interest rate risk strategy and asset/liability management, if it is deemed appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold $19.1 million of low-rate one- to four- family residential loans in the secondary market. We typically retain servicing rights when we sell one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.\nCommercial business loans, home equity loans and consumer loans provide diversification to our loan portfolio while meeting the needs of our customers. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our commercial business loan portfolio represented 7.7% and 5.7%, respectively, of total loans, while the home equity loan portfolio represented 9.0% and 9.6%, of total loans, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAsset Quality. We remain committed to maintaining prudent underwriting standards and aggressively monitoring our loan portfolio to maintain asset quality. We introduce loan products only when we are confident that our staff has the necessary expertise to originate and administer such loans, and that sound underwriting and collection procedures are in place. Our goal is to continue to improve our asset quality through prudent underwriting standards and the diligence of our loan collection personnel.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIt is management's opinion that accounting estimates covering certain aspects of our business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity required in making such estimates.\n\ufeff\nAllowance for loan losses. Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses required for probable credit losses and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations. Management's monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance considers our historical loan loss experience, review of specific loans that are past due or where management has knowledge of possible credit problems, current economic conditions, and such other factors considered appropriate to estimate loan losses. Management uses presently available information to estimate probable losses on loans; however, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in estimates, assumptions, or economic conditions. Significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions in our local market areas, concentrations of risk or a decline in local property values. During 2020, the Company adjusted certain qualitative factors to take into account the uncertain impacts of COVID-19 on economic conditions and borrowers' ability to repay loans. The Company's determination as to the amount of its allowance for loan losses is subject to review by its bank regulators, which can require the establishment of additional loss allowances. Refer to Note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information on the allowance for loan losses.\nInvestment Valuations. In management's opinion, the accounting policy relating to the valuation of investments is a critical accounting policy. We use a third party vendor to provide independent pricing of the securities in our investment portfolio. The third party vendor utilizes public quotations, third party dealer quotes and pricing models. The determination of fair value pricing on investments may require significant judgment or estimation, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the item being valued. The use of different assumptions for these valuations could produce significantly different results which may have material positive or negative effects on the results of our operations. Refer to Note 14 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nImpairment of Investments. Management also considers the accounting policy relating to the impairment of investments to be a critical accounting policy due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the material effect an impairment loss could have on the consolidated results of income. The credit portion of a decline in the fair market value of investments below cost deemed to be other-than-temporary ( OTTI\u201d) may be charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for an asset. Management continually reviews the current value of its investments for evidence of OTTI. Refer to Note 4 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information on OTTI.\nThese critical policies and their application are reviewed periodically by our Audit/Risk Committee and our Board of Directors. All accounting policies are important, and as such, we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements to better understand how our financial performance is reported.\n\ufeff\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as commercial and residential mortgage loans and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on them.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields. The following table sets forth certain information relating to our average balance sheets and reflects the average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the years indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the years indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for loan losses, but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to yields. The net amortization of deferred loan fees and costs were $566,000 and $598,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest income on securities does not include a tax equivalent adjustment for bank qualified municipal bonds.\n\ufeff\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

The following table analyzes the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table shows the amount of the change in interest income or expense caused by either changes in outstanding balances (volume) or changes in interest rates. The effect of a change in volume is measured by applying the average rate during the first year to the volume change between the two years. The effect of changes in rate is measured by applying the change in rate between the two years to the average volume during the first year. Changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the absolute value of the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\n\ufeff\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this report for more information on our loan portfolio.\n\ufeff\nAs noted earlier in this report, during 2020 we participated in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank originated 252 PPP loans for our customers, which totaled $26.9 million. We funded $18.4 million of PPP loans directly with the remaining $8.5 million funded indirectly via our partnership with Pursuit, a SBA lender that operates in the northeast. The Company received an origination fee from the SBA for the origination of PPP loans and recorded approximately $247,000 in net fees associated with the processing of these loans. Upon funding the loans, the net fees were deferred and will be amortized over the life of the loans as an adjustment to yield. At December 31, 2020, there were $18.6 million in PPP loans outstanding and recorded as commercial business loans. The Bank began the process of assisting PPP loan borrowers with the forgiveness application phase of the program in December 2020. The Bank expects that the majority of the PPP loans will be forgiven by the SBA during the first six months of 2021 upon which any unamortized deferred fees will be recognized as an adjustment to interest income. The Bank is participating in the origination of PPP loans under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 which was signed into law during December 2020.\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we remained strategically focused on originating shorter duration, adjustable rate commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans to diversify our asset mix\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nand to properly manage interest rate risk. The origination of the SBA guaranteed PPP loans provided additional interest rate risk protection and shortened the duration of our loan portfolio.\n\ufeff\nThe Company implemented a loan modification program for those borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 that was in line with interagency regulatory guidance, which allowed borrowers to defer loan payments for a period of time, generally 90 to 180 days. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had approved loan payment deferral requests on 219 loans, representing $103.1 million, or 21.1%, of the Bank's loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, there were 14 loans, representing $23.8 million, or 4.5%, of the loan portfolio, that remained in the payment deferral program. These loans were current at the time of initial modification and were not considered troubled debt restructurings under the CARES Act and the associated interagency regulatory guidance. Refer to Note 3 in the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information on the CARES Act and accounting guidance surrounding these loan modifications.\nThe table below summarizes the outstanding loan balance as of December 31, 2020 for those loans that remained in the payment deferral program on that date (dollars in thousands):\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan Type\n</td> <td>\nNumber of Loans\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nBalance Outstanding\n</td> <td>\nWeighted Average Interest Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial real estate\n</td> <td>8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>22,145 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>4.69 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial business\n</td> <td>6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,673 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>5.16 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>14 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>23,818 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>4.72 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTotal payment deferral requests on real estate loans were primarily secured by real estate located in Western New York.\nWhile many industries have and will continue to experience adverse impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's management team has considered the categories below to be at risk\u201d of significant impact.

</tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, management adjusted certain qualitative factors in the calculation of its provision for loan losses to account for the uncertain impact of COVID-19 on economic conditions and borrowers' ability to repay loans, resulting in an $828,000 provision. The remaining provision for loan losses of $797,000 was due to net charge-offs, an increase in classified loans, organic growth and changes in the loan portfolio mix and historical loss factor. As a result of the additional provision related to the uncertain impact of COVID-19, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total net loans ratio increased 21 basis points to 1.12% at December 31, 2020. The significant increase in the allowance for loan loss to non-performing loan ratio for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the increase in provision for loan losses and a $444,000 decrease in non-performing loans.\n\ufeff\nAccrued interest receivable increased $834,000, or 38.7%, to $3.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $2.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest receivables on loans for borrowers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and received the Bank's approval to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndefer principal and interest payments. At this time, it is expected that the deferred interest on these loans will be collected in full.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nThe table below shows changes in deposit balances by type of deposit account between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore Deposits\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDemand deposits and NOW accounts:\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-interest bearing\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>91,946 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>61,229 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>30,717 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>50.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest bearing\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>84,839 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>56,703 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>28,136 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>49.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMoney market\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>158,505 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>141,398 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>17,107 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSavings\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>65,643 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>53,628 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>12,015 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>22.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal core deposits\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>400,933 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>312,958 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>87,975 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>28.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-core Deposits\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime deposits\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>159,326 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>170,518 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(11,192) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>(6.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal deposits\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>560,259 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>483,476 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>76,783 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>15.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe increase in total deposits was primarily due to an overall increase in net core deposits, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. A majority of the growth in core deposits during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to organic growth, the deposit of PPP funds and government stimulus payments into our customers' deposit accounts and the impact of COVID-19 on consumer and business spending and savings levels. The Company's strategic focus continues to be centered on organic growth of low-cost core deposits among its retail and commercial customers in an effort to manage interest expense and strengthen customer relationships.\n\ufeff\nLong-term debt consisting of advances from the FHLBNY, decreased by $4.9 million, or 14.1%, from $34.7 million at December 31, 2019 to $29.8 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to the Company paying off maturing debt with excess cash on hand.\n\ufeff\nTotal stockholders' equity increased by $3.1 million, or 3.7%, from $82.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $85.9 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily attributed to $4.6 million of net income and an increase of $817,000 in other comprehensive income, which was partially offset by stock repurchases of $1.6 million and dividends paid of $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\ufeff\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nGeneral. Net income was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or $0.77 per diluted share, an increase of $471,000, or 11.5%, compared to net income of $4.1 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflected an $862,000 increase in net interest income and a $500,000 increase in non-interest income which was partially offset by a $725,000 increase in provision for loan losses, and a $169,000 increase in income tax expense when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased by $862,000, or 4.5%, to $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income remained flat, while interest expense decreased by 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest rate spread and net interest margin were 3.05% and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n3.23%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 3.34% and 3.58%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\ufeff\nInterest Income. Interest income increased by $69,000, or 0.3%, to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in loan interest income. Loan interest income increased by $697,000, or 3.3%, to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in the average balance of the loan portfolio by $55.1 million, or 12.7%, from $432.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $487.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the average balance of loans was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of commercial real estate and commercial business loans. The average yield on the loan portfolio decreased by 42 basis points from 4.94% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.52% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the average yield on loans was due to a decrease in market interest rates since December 31, 2019. It was also due to the origination of PPP loans, which have an interest rate of 1.00% as per the SBA guidelines. The net yield on the PPP loans, when including the deferred origination fee income and cost, averaged 1.80%, which is well below traditional loan yields.\nInvestment interest income decreased $363,000, or 14.4%, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a decrease in the average balance and average yield of the investment portfolio. The average balance of the investment portfolio decreased from $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the decrease in the average yield was 31 basis points from 3.11% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 2.80% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the average balance and average yield of the investment portfolio since December 31, 2019 was primarily due to securities paydowns and redemptions of callable\u201d municipal bonds, partially offset by securities purchases at lower average yields which largely consisted of municipal bond purchases.\nOther interest income decreased by $265,000, or 71.8%, to $104,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The average yield decreased 186 basis points to 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.06% for the year ended December 31, 2019, while the average balance of other interest earning assets increased from $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the average yield was primarily due to lower average rates earned on excess funds, as a result of the 150 basis points decrease in short term market interest rates since December 31, 2019. The increase in the average balance of other interest earning assets was primarily due to an increase in average deposits that were only partially used to fund loan originations.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $793,000, or 15.3%, to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in interest paid on deposits. Interest paid on deposits decreased by $823,000, or 18.3%, to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a 32 basis points decrease in the average rate paid on deposits due to the decrease in market interest rates since December 31 2019. The decrease was partially offset by a $56.4 million, or 14.2%, increase in average deposit balances for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The average balance of deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $453.2 million with an average rate of 0.81% compared to the average balance of deposits of $396.8 million and an average rate of 1.13% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits was due to an increase in core deposit accounts primarily through organic growth, the deposit of PPP funds and government stimulus payments into our customers' deposit accounts and the impact of COVID-19 on consumer and business spending and savings levels.\nThe interest expense on short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased by $35,000, or 5.5%, to $668,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in the average balance of advances from the FHLBNY. The average balance of advances from the FHLBNY for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.9 million with an average rate of\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2.03% compared to an average balance of $29.4 million and an average rate of 2.16% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the average balance of FHLBNY advances was due to additional borrowings that allowed the Bank to take advantage of long term, low fixed-rates to fund loan growth and mitigate interest rate risk. The 13 basis points decrease in the average rate paid on FHLBNY advances was primarily due to the decrease in market interest rates since December 31, 2019.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A $1.6 million provision to the allowance for loan losses was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $725,000 increase in the provision expense was primarily due to an adjustment of certain qualitative factors to take into account the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on borrowers' ability to repay loans. We expect economic uncertainty to continue which may result in additional increases to the allowance for loan losses in future periods. The current year provision was also impacted by a $12.5 million increase in criticized commercial real estate and commercial business loans.\nWe complete a comprehensive quarterly evaluation to determine our provision for loan losses. The evaluation reflects analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience, supplemented as necessary by credit judgment that considers observable trends, conditions, and other relevant environmental and economic factors.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a $1.4 million net provision for commercial real estate and construction - commercial loans. This consisted of a $693,000 provision to reflect an adjustment of certain qualitative factors to take into account the uncertain impact of COVID-19 on economic conditions and borrowers' ability to repay loans and a $638,000 general allowance to reflect inherent losses within the portfolio due to $42.7 million of organic growth during 2020. It also included an $84,000 provision to reflect the $11.6 million increase in criticized and classified commercial real estate loans, which consists primarily of one loan relationship which is well-collateralized. A $199,000 net provision was recorded for commercial business loans which reflected adjustments to certain qualitative factors relating to the COVID-19 impact on economic conditions and an increase in classified loans. The provision also reflected a credit allowance to account for a $4.0 million decrease in outstanding commercial business loans, excluding PPP loans, during the year ended December 31, 2020. An $11,000 credit provision was recorded for one-to four-family, home equity and consumer loans primarily to reflect a decrease in classified loans during the year ended December 31, 2020. A $22,000 unallocated provision was recorded to reflect the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe provision to the allowance for loan losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 included an $847,000 net provision to account for inherent losses in the commercial real estate portfolio, including commercial construction loans, as a result of $79.0 million of organic growth and a $4.2 million increase in criticized and classified commercial real estate loans since December 31, 2018. The net provision also included changes in relevant environmental and economic factors. A $23,000 net credit provision was recorded on the commercial business loan portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2019 that took into account changes in the related environmental factors used to qualitatively assess inherent loan losses on commercial business loans and changes in the historical average net charge-off rate, which was partially offset by a provision to account for inherent losses resulting from $4.9 million of organic growth and an increase in criticized and classified commercial business loans during the year ended December 31, 2019. A $32,000 net provision was recorded for one-to four-family, home equity and consumer loans due to changes in the related environmental factors used to qualitatively assess inherent loan losses on these types of loans, partially offset by loan charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2019. Lastly, a $44,000 provision was recorded on the unallocated provision for loan losses, to reflect the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general losses in the portfolio.\nRefer to Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the provision for loan losses.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNon-interest Income. Non-interest income increased by $500,000, or 20.1%, to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $777,000 increase in gains on the sale of loans. This was driven by an increase in the volume of residential mortgage loans originated for sale during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the decrease in market rates. We sell certain low, fixed rate mortgages into the secondary market to manage interest rate risk. We sold $19.1 million of loans during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Non-interest income was also positively impacted by a $70,000 increase in debit card fee income. The increase in non-interest income was partially offset by a $247,000 decrease in service charges and fees during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the waiver of certain ATM fees and other service charges to provide relief to customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was also partially offset by a $58,000 increase in unrealized losses on equity securities and a $52,000 increase in unrealized losses on derivative contracts due to the decrease in market interest rates.\nNon-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses were $15.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Other expenses decreased $236,000, or 16.5%, primarily due to a decrease in travel, training, foreclosure and other real estate owned expenses. Salaries and employee benefits decreased $139,000, or 1.6%, primarily due to an increase in deferred salary expense related to PPP loan originations and decreases in stock-based compensation expense and health insurance costs, partially offset by an increase in employee salaries and incentive awards. These decreases were offset by an increase in data processing expenses of $127,000, or 9.4%, primarily due to an increase in core system processing costs and activity. Professional services expense increased $110,000, or 12.8%, primarily due to an increase in legal and accounting costs. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased $92,000, or 3.7%, primarily due to increases in software and technology maintenance costs, equipment depreciation and additional cleaning expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic. FDIC Insurance expense increased $51,000 due to the receipt of small bank assessment credits during the prior year ended December 31, 2019. Advertising expense decreased $37,000, or 5.2%, primarily due to a decrease in marketing expenses. Postage and supplies increased $29,000, or 11.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to additional supply purchases to protect the health and safety of customers and employees as a result of the pandemic.\nIncome Taxes Expense. Income tax expense was $824,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $169,000, or 25.8%, as compared to $655,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 15.3% and 13.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the mix of tax-exempt income derived from our municipal bond portfolio in relation to our pre-tax income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise during the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to fund loan commitments, to pay the deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers as well as to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and securities, maturities and sales of investments and loans, excess cash, interest earning deposits at other financial institutions and funds provided from operations. We have written agreements with the FHLBNY, which allows us to borrow the maximum lending values designated by the type of collateral pledged. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum amount that we could borrow from the FHLBNY was $109.8 million and was collateralized by a pledge of certain fixed-rate residential, one- to four-family loans. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding advances under this agreement of $29.8 million. We have a written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank discount window for overnight borrowings which is collateralized by a pledge of our securities, and allows us to borrow up to the value of the securities pledged, which was equal to a book value of $10.8 million and a fair value of $11.2 million as of December 31, 2020. There were no balances outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank at December 31, 2020. We have also established lines of credits with correspondent banks for $31.0 million, of which $29.0 million is unsecured and the remaining $2.0 million will be secured by a pledge of our securities when a draw is made. There were no borrowings on these lines as of December 31, 2020.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit outflows, calls of investment securities, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. We have not experienced any unusual pressure on our deposit balances or our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\ufeff\nOur primary investing activities include the origination of loans and the purchase of investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we originated loans of approximately $188.5 million as compared to approximately $169.2 million of loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2019. Loan originations exceeded principal repayments and other deductions in 2020 by $55.5 million. Purchases of investment securities totaled $28.0 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These activities were funded primarily through deposit growth, principal payments received on loans and securities, borrowings and cash reserves.\n\ufeff\nAs described elsewhere in this report, the Company has loan commitments to borrowers and borrowers have unused overdraft lines of protection, unused home equity lines of credit and unused commercial lines of credit that may require funding at a future date. The Company believes it has sufficient funds to fulfill these commitments, including sources of funds available through the use of FHLBNY advances or other liquidity sources. Total deposits were $560.3 million at December 31, 2020, as compared to $483.5 million at December 31, 2019. Approximately $106.1 million of time deposit accounts are scheduled to mature within one year as of December 31, 2020. Based on our deposit retention experience, current pricing strategy, and competitive pricing policies, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us following their maturity.\n\ufeff\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore, we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. The marginal cost of new funding, however, whether from deposits or borrowings from the FHLBNY, will be carefully considered as we monitor our liquidity needs. Therefore, in order to minimize our cost of funds, we may consider additional borrowings from the FHLBNY in the future.\n\ufeff\nWe do not anticipate any material capital expenditures in 2021. We do not have any balloon or other payments due on any long-term obligations, other than the borrowing agreements noted above.\n\ufeff\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet items include loan commitments as described in Note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $6.0 million, which is not designated as a hedging instrument and does not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2020, we had loan commitments to borrowers of approximately $47.1 million and overdraft lines of credit, unused home equity lines of credit, and unused commercial lines of credit of approximately $66.1 million. We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\n\ufeff\nAccounting Polices, Standards and Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies, the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards and recent accounting pronouncements.\n\ufeff", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's financial condition and results of operations, as well as a discussion of its management strategy, risks, and critical accounting policies. The report highlights the significant impact of COVID-19 on the company's operational and financial performance, with measures taken by the Federal Reserve and federal and state governments to mitigate its effects. The company's net interest income, interest rate risk, credit risk, and lending activities are also analyzed. The report compares the financial condition at the end of 2020 with that of 2019, emphasizing changes in total assets, cash and cash equivalents, securities available for sale, and net loans receivable. Overall, the report offers a comprehensive view of the company's financial standing and strategic direction.", "item_7_tables": "Table 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nThis discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K, and the other statistical data provided in this Form 10-K.\nGeneral Overview of the Company's Activities and Risks\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans and investments and the interest expense we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on these balances.\nOur operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges and fees and gains and losses on the sales of securities and loans, our provision for loan losses and non-interest expenses which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional services, advertising and other general and administrative expenses.\nFinancial institutions like us, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are principally concentrated in the Western New York area, and our operations and earnings are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations are also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact the Company.\nTo operate successfully, we must manage various types of risk, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational and information technology risks, strategic risk, reputation risk and compliance risk. A significant form of market risk for the Company is interest rate risk, as the Company's assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. Net interest income is our primary source of revenue and interest rate risk is a significant non-credit related risk to which our Company is exposed. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of our assets and liabilities. In addition to directly impacting net interest income, changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers and debt issuers to repay loans and debt securities, the volume of loan repayments and refinancings, the flow and mix of deposits and the fair value of available for sale securities.\nIn recent years, the Company has adjusted its strategies to manage interest rate risk by originating a greater volume of shorter-term, adjustable rate commercial real estate and commercial business loans and increasing its concentration of core deposits, which are less interest rate sensitive. The Company has entered into two interest rate swap arrangements with a total notional amount of $6.0 million to convert a portion of its fixed rate residential, one- to four-family real estate loans into adjustable rate interest-earning assets, to better manage its exposure to movements in interest rates. The Asset and Liability Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk and the Asset and Liability Committee meets at least quarterly to review the interest rate risk position.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCredit risk is also a significant form of risk for the Company. Credit risk is the risk to our earnings and stockholders' equity that results from customers, to whom loans have been made, and from issuers of debt securities in which the Company has invested, failing to repay their obligations. The magnitude of risk depends on the capacity and willingness of borrowers and debt issuers to repay and the sufficiency of the value of collateral obtained to secure the loans made or investments purchased. This risk is managed by policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors, review of compliance with the policies and periodic reporting and evaluation of loans or securities that are non-performing or demonstrate other characteristics of potential loss.\n\ufeff\nCOVID-19 Risks\nAs noted in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d), which was originally identified in Wuhan, China, rapidly spread to a number of countries around the world, including the United States during 2020. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020. In the United States, the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus invoked various Federal and State, including New York State, authorities to make emergency declarations and issue executive orders to limit the spread of the disease. This included restrictions on travel, business operations, public gatherings, school closings, and mandates to close non-essential businesses.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted the level of economic activity in the Bank's market areas during 2020. Since May 2020, some of the above-noted restrictions have been relaxed, resulting in certain industries being able to re-open for business, with appropriate health measures and social distancing protocols put in place. The initial, current and ongoing restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, including among others, those in the travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, and have resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees in the market areas in which we operate.\nIn light of the changing economic outlook as a result of COVID-19, as well as other factors, the 10-year Treasury yield had fallen to historic lows during 2020, and the equity markets have been significantly impacted and remain volatile. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the Federal government signed the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 into law, which included direct financial aid to American families and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors through programs like the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) and Main Street Lending Program ( MSLP\u201d). The Federal Reserve's actions, actions of federal and state governments, and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our interest income and, therefore, our earnings, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, economic uncertainties have arisen which are likely to negatively impact our borrowers' ability to repay their loans. As discussed elsewhere in this report, the Company significantly increased its provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 and believes its total reserve is adequate. Other financial impacts could occur though such potential impact is unknown at this time.\n\ufeff\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain, cannot be predicted and will depend, among other things, on the duration of the pandemic, the actions undertaken by national, state and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or mitigate its effects, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines that have been developed and the ability of pharmaceutical companies and governments to manufacture and distribute those vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Bank's capital was in excess of regulatory requirements. While management believes we have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, our regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by further credit losses. The Company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity which could be used to support capital ratios.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nManagement Strategy\nOur Reputation. Our primary management strategy has been to maintain our position as an authentic community bank, locally headquartered in Western New York, with nearly 130 years of service to our community. Our management team strives to accomplish this goal by continuing to emphasize our exceptional individualized customer service and financial strength, continued community involvement, effective risk management, strong capital levels, technological services and penetration in our market areas via organic growth of loans and deposits.\nBranding and Marketing. We currently operate eleven full-service branch offices throughout Western New York, where our branch teams initiate and develop both consumer and commercial customer relationships in and around the surrounding market areas. We offer concierge banking services, together with our online and mobile customer conveniences, creating a truly individualized approach for customers to manage their finances whenever, wherever and however they wish. As a true local bank, we pride ourselves on offering competitive products delivered with the individualized service our customers have come to expect. Our experienced team of commercial bankers can meet the needs of nearly any type of business through a variety of checking and credit products, and banking services. The retail banking team located in our branch offices focuses on meeting the deposit and lending needs of all consumers through-out various life stages. Our team members live and work right here in our Western New York communities and can fully understand the specific challenges and opportunities our customers face daily. As the banking industry continues to rapidly evolve in terms of technological conveniences, we remain proactive in our efforts to provide e-banking services that our customers expect. From local decision-making, responding quickly and efficiently to customer needs, and utilizing technology to level the playing field with our competitors, we are committed to developing long-term relationships with our customers. Staying true to our local roots and mission of Putting People First\u201d continues to uniquely position us as a bank of choice in Western New York.\nTechnology. An important strategic objective is to continue to evaluate and enhance the technology supporting our customer service. We are committed to making investments in technology and we believe that it represents an efficient way to deploy a portion of our capital. To this end, the Company has developed a five year plan for the implementation of cost effective and efficient digital services to meet our customer's technology needs, to focus on attracting new customers, and to improve our operational efficiencies. Although we remain committed to expanding our retail branch footprint whenever it makes strategic sense, we will be concentrating our near term efforts on expanding our digital footprint. As part of this initiative, we plan to convert a portion of our banking systems to a new provider in the third quarter of 2021, which will improve our ability to efficiently serve our customers and will provide our customers with updated e-banking services for their convenience.\nOur People. A large part of our success is related to customer service and customer satisfaction. Having employees who understand and value our clientele and their business is a key component to our success. We believe that our present staff is one of our competitive strengths, and thus the retention of such persons and our ability to continue to attract quality personnel is a high priority.\n\ufeff\nLending. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio with emphasis on the origination of short-term adjustable rate commercial real estate, commercial business and home equity loans, while maintaining strong underwriting and asset quality.\n\ufeff\nDue to the interest rate risk inherent in holding long-term, fixed rate one- to four-family real estate loans in our portfolio, we have been strategically focused on increasing the originations of commercial real estate loans to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of developed real estate. We have also focused on commercial business lending to small businesses, including business installment loans, lines of credit and other commercial loans. These types of commercial loans are generally made at higher interest rates and for shorter terms than one- to four-family real estate loans, which reduces the Bank's interest rate risk. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our commercial real estate loan portfolio (including loans to finance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe construction of commercial real estate) represented the largest holdings in our loan portfolio at 54.4% and 51.6%, respectively, of total loans.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, residential one- to four-family mortgage loans (including loans to finance the construction of one- to four-family homes) represented the second largest holding in our loan portfolio at 28.6% and 32.8%, respectively. We may sell low-yielding long-term conforming fixed rate one- to four-family residential loans that we originate on the secondary market, as part of our interest rate risk strategy and asset/liability management, if it is deemed appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold $19.1 million of low-rate one- to four- family residential loans in the secondary market. We typically retain servicing rights when we sell one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.\nCommercial business loans, home equity loans and consumer loans provide diversification to our loan portfolio while meeting the needs of our customers. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our commercial business loan portfolio represented 7.7% and 5.7%, respectively, of total loans, while the home equity loan portfolio represented 9.0% and 9.6%, of total loans, respectively.\n\ufeff\nAsset Quality. We remain committed to maintaining prudent underwriting standards and aggressively monitoring our loan portfolio to maintain asset quality. We introduce loan products only when we are confident that our staff has the necessary expertise to originate and administer such loans, and that sound underwriting and collection procedures are in place. Our goal is to continue to improve our asset quality through prudent underwriting standards and the diligence of our loan collection personnel.\n\ufeff\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIt is management's opinion that accounting estimates covering certain aspects of our business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity required in making such estimates.\n\ufeff\nAllowance for loan losses. Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses required for probable credit losses and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations. Management's monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance considers our historical loan loss experience, review of specific loans that are past due or where management has knowledge of possible credit problems, current economic conditions, and such other factors considered appropriate to estimate loan losses. Management uses presently available information to estimate probable losses on loans; however, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in estimates, assumptions, or economic conditions. Significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions in our local market areas, concentrations of risk or a decline in local property values. During 2020, the Company adjusted certain qualitative factors to take into account the uncertain impacts of COVID-19 on economic conditions and borrowers' ability to repay loans. The Company's determination as to the amount of its allowance for loan losses is subject to review by its bank regulators, which can require the establishment of additional loss allowances. Refer to Note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information on the allowance for loan losses.\nInvestment Valuations. In management's opinion, the accounting policy relating to the valuation of investments is a critical accounting policy. We use a third party vendor to provide independent pricing of the securities in our investment portfolio. The third party vendor utilizes public quotations, third party dealer quotes and pricing models. The determination of fair value pricing on investments may require significant judgment or estimation, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the item being valued. The use of different assumptions for these valuations could produce significantly different results which may have material positive or negative effects on the results of our operations. Refer to Note 14 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nImpairment of Investments. Management also considers the accounting policy relating to the impairment of investments to be a critical accounting policy due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the material effect an impairment loss could have on the consolidated results of income. The credit portion of a decline in the fair market value of investments below cost deemed to be other-than-temporary ( OTTI\u201d) may be charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for an asset. Management continually reviews the current value of its investments for evidence of OTTI. Refer to Note 4 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information on OTTI.\nThese critical policies and their application are reviewed periodically by our Audit/Risk Committee and our Board of Directors. All accounting policies are important, and as such, we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements to better understand how our financial performance is reported.\n\ufeff\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as commercial and residential mortgage loans and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on them.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields. The following table sets forth certain information relating to our average balance sheets and reflects the average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the years indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the years indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for loan losses, but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to yields. The net amortization of deferred loan fees and costs were $566,000 and $598,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest income on securities does not include a tax equivalent adjustment for bank qualified municipal bonds.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n (1) The tax equivalent adjustment for bank qualified municipal securities results in rates of 3.21% and 3.56% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRate Volume Analysis. The following table analyzes the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table shows the amount of the change in interest income or expense caused by either changes in outstanding balances (volume) or changes in interest rates. The effect of a change in volume is measured by applying the average rate during the first year to the volume change between the two years. The effect of changes in rate is measured by applying the change in rate between the two years to the average volume during the first year. Changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the absolute value of the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nAs shown in the above table, net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been affected most significantly by the increase in the average volume of loans and a decrease in average interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities, specifically average interest rates on deposit products, partially offset by a decrease in the average yields earned on interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread decreased by 29 basis points to 3.05% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 3.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net interest margin decreased by 35 basis points to 3.23% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 3.58% for the prior year. The decrease in net interest spread and net interest margin were primarily due to a 61 basis points decrease in average yields earned on interest earnings assets, which was partially offset by a 32 basis points decrease in average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\n\ufeff\nTotal assets at December 31, 2020 were $686.2 million, an increase of $75.3 million, or 12.3%, from $610.9 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily due to a $53.3 million increase in loans receivable, net, a $12.7 million increase in cash and cash equivalents driven by deposit growth and an $8.1 million increase in securities available for sale.\n\ufeff\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $12.7 million, or 41.9%, from $30.3 million at December 31, 2019 to $43.0 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $76.8 million increase in deposits, partially offset by a $55.5 million net cash outflow relating to net loan originations and principal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncollections, a $7.1 million net cash outflow related to net purchases of securities available for sale and a $4.9 million net cash outflow to pay down long-term debt.\n\ufeff\nSecurities available for sale increased by $8.1 million, or 11.4%, from $71.2 million at December 31, 2019 to $79.3 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the purchase of securities, which was partially offset by maturities, calls and prepayments during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\ufeff\nNet loans receivable increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 as shown in the table below:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n (1) Includes one- to four-family construction loans. \n\ufeff\nThe $53.3 million, or 11.3%, increase in loans receivable, net was primarily due to an increase in commercial real estate and commercial business loans (primarily", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nThis discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K, and the other statistical data provided in this Form 10-K.\nGeneral Overview of the Company's Activities and Risks\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans and investments and the interest expense we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on these balances.\nOur operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges and fees and gains and losses on the sales of securities and loans, our provision for loan losses and non-interest expenses which include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, data processing, professional services, advertising and other general and administrative expenses.\nFinancial institutions like us, in general, are significantly affected by economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for and supply of housing and commercial real estate, competition among lenders, interest rate conditions, and funds availability. Our operations and lending are principally concentrated in the Western New York area, and our operations and earnings are influenced by local economic conditions. Deposit balances and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates on competing investments, customer preferences, and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area. Operations are also significantly impacted by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact the Company.\nTo operate successfully, we must manage various types of risk, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational and information technology risks, strategic risk, reputation risk and compliance risk. A significant form of market risk for the Company is interest rate risk, as the Company's assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. Net interest income is our primary source of revenue and interest rate risk is a significant non-credit related risk to which our Company is exposed.

Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk and the Asset and Liability Committee meets at least quarterly to review the interest rate risk position.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCredit risk is also a significant form of risk for the Company. Credit risk is the risk to our earnings and stockholders' equity that results from customers, to whom loans have been made, and from issuers of debt securities in which the Company has invested, failing to repay their obligations. The magnitude of risk depends on the capacity and willingness of borrowers and debt issuers to repay and the sufficiency of the value of collateral obtained to secure the loans made or investments purchased. This risk is managed by policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors, review of compliance with the policies and periodic reporting and evaluation of loans or securities that are non-performing or demonstrate other characteristics of potential loss.\n\ufeff\nCOVID-19 Risks\nAs noted in Part I, Item 1A.

Management uses presently available information to estimate probable losses on loans; however, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in estimates, assumptions, or economic conditions. Significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions in our local market areas, concentrations of risk or a decline in local property values. During 2020, the Company adjusted certain qualitative factors to take into account the uncertain impacts of COVID-19 on economic conditions and borrowers' ability to repay loans. The Company's determination as to the amount of its allowance for loan losses is subject to review by its bank regulators, which can require the establishment of additional loss allowances. Refer to Note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information on the allowance for loan losses.\nInvestment Valuations. In management's opinion, the accounting policy relating to the valuation of investments is a critical accounting policy. We use a third party vendor to provide independent pricing of the securities in our investment portfolio. The third party vendor utilizes public quotations, third party dealer quotes and pricing models. The determination of fair value pricing on investments may require significant judgment or estimation, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the item being valued. The use of different assumptions for these valuations could produce significantly different results which may have material positive or negative effects on the results of our operations. Refer to Note 14 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nImpairment of Investments. Management also considers the accounting policy relating to the impairment of investments to be a critical accounting policy due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the material effect an impairment loss could have on the consolidated results of income. The credit portion of a decline in the fair market value of investments below cost deemed to be other-than-temporary ( OTTI\u201d) may be charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for an asset. Management continually reviews the current value of its investments for evidence of OTTI. Refer to Note 4 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information on OTTI.\nThese critical policies and their application are reviewed periodically by our Audit/Risk Committee and our Board of Directors. All accounting policies are important, and as such, we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements to better understand how our financial performance is reported.\n\ufeff\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between the interest we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as commercial and residential mortgage loans and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earn or pay on them.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields. The following table sets forth certain information relating to our average balance sheets and reflects the average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, interest earned and interest paid for the years indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances over the years indicated. The average balances for loans are net of allowance for loan losses, but include non-accrual loans. The loan yields include net amortization of certain deferred fees and costs that are considered adjustments to yields. The net amortization of deferred loan fees and costs were $566,000 and $598,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest income on securities does not include a tax equivalent adjustment for bank qualified municipal bonds.\n\ufeff\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>

The following table analyzes the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table shows the amount of the change in interest income or expense caused by either changes in outstanding balances (volume) or changes in interest rates. The effect of a change in volume is measured by applying the average rate during the first year to the volume change between the two years. The effect of changes in rate is measured by applying the change in rate between the two years to the average volume during the first year. Changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the absolute value of the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\n\ufeff\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td>
