Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nGeneral overview\nSonoco is a leading manufacturer of consumer, industrial and protective packaging products and provider of packaging services with 312 locations in 36 countries. The Company's operations are reported in four segments, Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.\nGenerally, the Company serves two broad end-use markets, consumer and industrial, which, period to period, can exhibit different economic characteristics from each other. Geographically, approximately 65% of sales were generated in the United States, 20% in Europe, 5% in Asia, 5% in Canada and 5% in other regions.\nThe Company is a market-share leader in many of its product lines, particularly in tubes, cores and composite containers. Competition in most of the Company's businesses is intense. Demand for the Company's products and services is primarily driven by the overall level of consumer consumption of non-durable goods; however, certain product and service groups are tied more directly to durable goods, such as appliances, automobiles and construction. The businesses that supply and/or service consumer product companies have tended to be, on a relative basis, more recession resistant than those that service industrial markets.\nFinancially, the Company's objective is to deliver average annual double-digit total returns to shareholders over time. To meet that target, the Company focuses on three major areas: driving profitable sales growth, improving margins and leveraging the Company's strong cash flow and financial position. Operationally, the Company's goal is to be the acknowledged leader in high-quality, innovative, value-creating packaging solutions within targeted customer market segments.\nOver the next two to three years, the Company aspires to achieve operating profit before depreciation and amortization (OPBDA) margins of 16% per year and annual sales of approximately $6 billion. (See \"Use of Non-GAAP financial measures\" below). The Company believes it will achieve these goals by focusing on the following: organic sales growth, including new product development and expansion in emerging international markets; strategic portfolio optimization; and margin enhancement through more effective customer relationship management, organizational design, indirect spend management, and improved manufacturing productivity, supply chain and back office support processes.\nUse of Non-GAAP financial measures\nTo assess and communicate the financial performance of the Company, Sonoco management uses, both internally and externally, certain financial performance measures that are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP\u201d financial measures). These non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Company's GAAP operating results adjusted to remove amounts, including the associated tax effects, relating to restructuring initiatives, asset impairment charges, environmental charges, acquisition-related costs, gains or losses from the disposition of businesses, excess property insurance recoveries, pension settlement charges, certain income tax events and other items, if any, including other income tax-related adjustments and/or events, the exclusion of which management believes improves the period-to-period comparability and analysis of the underlying financial performance of the business. The adjusted non-GAAP results are identified using the term base,\u201d for example, base earnings.\u201d\nThe Company's base financial performance measures are not in accordance with, nor an alternative for, measures conforming to generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Sonoco continues to provide all information required by GAAP, but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor or other user is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. The Company uses the non-GAAP base\u201d performance measures presented herein for internal planning and forecasting purposes, to evaluate its ongoing operations, and to evaluate the ultimate performance of management and each business unit against plan/forecast all the way up through the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's performance by the Board of Directors. In addition, these same non-GAAP measures are used in determining incentive compensation for the entire management team and in providing earnings guidance to the investing community.\nSonoco management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Sonoco presents these non-GAAP financial measures to provide users information to evaluate Sonoco's operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance. Material limitations associated with the use of such measures are that they do not reflect all period costs included in operating expenses and may not reflect financial results that are comparable to financial results of other companies that present similar costs differently. Furthermore, the calculations of these non-GAAP measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that the investor may find material and view differently. To compensate for these limitations, management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of the business to review both GAAP information which includes all of the items impacting financial results and the non-GAAP measures that exclude certain elements, as described above.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges are a recurring item as Sonoco's restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. Although recurring, these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. Similarly, non-operating pension expense is a recurring item. However, this expense is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, global financial markets (including stock market returns and interest rate changes), plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances.\nReconciliations of GAAP to base results are presented on pages 21 and 22 in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations. Whenever reviewing a non-GAAP financial measure, readers are encouraged to review the related reconciliation to fully understand how it differs from the related GAAP measure. Reconciliations are not provided for non-GAAP measures related to future years due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which management is unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the tax effect of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\n2018 overview and 2019 outlook\nThe Company produced strong top-line, bottom-line and cash flow results in 2018 despite low growth rates in many of the Company's served markets, accelerating inflation, tariffs and disappointing performances in our plastics and flexible packaging businesses. Year-over-year growth in consolidated operating profit of 6.1% was largely driven by a $49.5 million, or 30.7%, increase in the operating profit of Paper and Industrial Converted Products and was also aided by a strong turnaround in our Display and Packaging segment. These gains were partially offset by a $31.3 million, or 12.2%, decline in operating profits for our Consumer Packaging segment. Operating profit for our Protective Solutions segment was relatively flat year over year. On a company-wide basis, gains from a positive overall price/cost relationship (the relationship of the change in\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>18\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nsales prices to the change in costs of materials, energy and freight) and the added operating profit from acquisitions were only partially offset by higher labor, maintenance and other operating costs. As a result, consolidated gross profit margin for 2018 improved modestly to 19.3% compared to 19.0% in 2017.\nNet Income Attributable to Sonoco (GAAP earnings) for 2018 increased $138.2 million, or 78.8%, year over year. This increase is largely due to prior-year pension settlement charges totaling $20.2 million, after-tax, a prior-year $51.3 million net tax charge related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"), and a 2018 valuation allowance release triggered by certain provisions of the Tax Act. The remainder is largely due to higher 2018 operating income together with the lower US statutory tax rate established by the Tax Act. Base earnings, which exclude the previously mentioned prior-year charges, the valuation allowance release, as well as certain other items of income and expense, as more fully described within this Item under \"Use of Non-GAAP financial measures\" and reconciled within this Item under \"Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures,\" improved $58.8 million, or 20.9%, year over year.\nManagement's focus in 2018 was on driving synergies with acquired businesses, accelerating organic growth, improving manufacturing productivity, using the Company's strong financial position to make strategic acquisitions and improving operating efficiency and financial performance of the Company's contract packaging services center near Atlanta, Georgia. Management expected overall volume in 2018 to increase approximately 2%, overall price/cost to be positive and that manufacturing productivity would more than offset increases in labor and other costs. Actual 2018 volume increased slightly more than one percent as gains in Display and Packaging were partially offset by declines in Consumer Products and Paper and Industrial Converted Products. The 2018 performance of businesses acquired in 2017 fell short of expectations due to a combination of volume shortfalls, production inefficiencies and negative price / cost. The volume shortfalls and production inefficiencies in these businesses were significant drivers leading to an overall flat year for manufacturing productivity. However, price/cost was positive in almost all of the Company's other businesses, and was extremely positive in the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment and the Company as a whole. Despite continued improvements at its Atlanta-area packaging center, the Company determined that it could not achieve acceptable margins under the associated single-customer contract and negotiated an early termination of that contract and exited the facility late in the third quarter of 2018. In October, the Company acquired both the remaining 70 percent interest in its Conitex-Sonoco tube and core/paper joint venture and a composite can operation from Texpack, Inc. This transaction brings the joint venture operations under the sole control of the Company and expands its exposure to the Asia paper and industrial products market. In April, the Company acquired Highland Packaging Solutions, a manufacturer of thermoformed plastic packaging for fresh produce and dairy products. Highland expands the Company's footprint in its targeted \"perimeter of the store\" market. These transactions are described in greater detail below.\nPension and postretirement benefit expenses for the year were approximately $44 million lower in 2018 than 2017, due primarily to settlement charges related to lump sum payments and purchases of annuities for certain plan participants in 2017. Excluding these charges, total benefit plan expense was approximately $12 million lower in 2018 than in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to higher expected returns on plan assets due to a higher asset base as of December 31, 2017. Total net contributions in 2018 to the Company's domestic and international pension and postretirement plans were approximately $25 million. The aggregate net unfunded position of the Company's various defined benefit plans increased from $332 million at the end of 2017, to $369 million at the end of 2018. This increase was driven by normal service and interest cost and a negative actual return on plan assets during 2018, partially offset by the impact of contributions and slightly higher discount rates on plan liabilities at December 31, 2018.\nThe effective tax rate on GAAP earnings was 19.8%, compared with 46.6% in 2017, and the effective tax rate on base earnings was 23.7%, compared with 31.1% in 2017. The year-over-year decrease in both GAAP and base effective tax rates was driven primarily by the Tax Act, including the decrease in the U.S. Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The year-over-year variance in the GAAP tax rate is also driven by Tax Act changes, including the 2018 benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits of $16.1 million and the exceptionally high 2017 rate, which included approximately $51.2 million of one-time tax charges related to the Tax Act.\nThe Company generated $589.9 million in cash from operations during 2018, compared with $348.3 million in 2017. The majority of the year-over-year increase is attributable to higher net income, lower pension and post-retirement contributions and a beneficial difference in the changes in working capital, partially offset by an unfavorable difference in the change in income tax accruals. Cash flow from operations is expected to be approximately $600 million in 2019.\nOutlook\nIn 2019, management's focus will be on generating profitable growth, improving margins, driving free cash flow, and portfolio optimization, including the potential for both targeted acquisitions and divestitures, which, in turn, are expected to impact margins and prospects for profitable growth. Key to management's objectives for the year will be further development of the Company's previously implemented commercial and operational excellence initiatives aimed at improving margins by more-fully realizing the value of our products and services, reducing our unit costs and better leveraging our fixed support costs.\nManagement is targeting an overall organic volume increase in 2019 of approximately 1.0%. Although the Company has projected that overall price/cost will be positive in 2019, duplicating the degree of price/cost improvement seen in 2018 is considered unlikely. Continued volatility in key raw material prices would make full recovery of any related cost increases more challenging. And, although manufacturing productivity is expected to offset a significant portion of the projected increases in labor and other costs, not realizing the targeted organic volume gains would make fully achieving management's productivity objectives more difficult. Operating results in 2019 will include a full year of revenue and operating profit from Highland and Conitex.\nThe Company projects the non-operating component of pension and post-retirement benefits expense to be approximately $19 million higher, while the operating component is projected to be $3 million lower. The net anticipated increase of $16 million is primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets due to a lower asset base and a 25 basis point decrease in the 2019 expected rate of return assumption. Total contributions in 2019 to the Company's domestic and international pension and postretirement plans are expected to be approximately $31.0 million.\nIn consideration of the above factors, management is projecting that reported net sales will increase nearly 5% and overall margins for gross profit, base operating profit and base operating profit before depreciation and amortization will improve modestly over 2018 levels.\nAbsent additional borrowings in 2019 from any acquisition activity, net interest expense is expected to decrease approximately $3 million due to lower average annual debt balances as the Company would expect to use a portion of its free cash flow to pay down existing debt. The consolidated effective tax rate on base earnings is expected to be between 25.5% and 26.5% in 2019 compared with 23.7% in 2018. The anticipated year-over-year increase is due to discrete items that benefited the 2018 rate that are not expected to recur in 2019.\nThe Company does not provide projected GAAP earnings results due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the income tax effects of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>19\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions and dispositions\nAcquisitions\nThe Company completed three acquisitions during 2018 at a cost of $278.8 million, net of cash acquired. On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 70 percent interest in Conitex Sonoco (BVI), Ltd. (\"Conitex Sonoco\") from Texpack Investments, Inc. (\"Texpack\") for total consideration of $134.8 million, including net cash payments of $127.8 million and debt assumed of $7.1 million. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing. This adjustment was settled in February 2019 and required an additional cash payment of approximately $0.1 million. The Conitex Sonoco joint venture was formed in 1998 with Texpack, a Spanish-based global provider of paperboard and paper-based packaging products. Conitex Sonoco produces uncoated recycled paperboard and tubes and cones for the global spun yarn industry, as well as adhesives, flexible intermediate bulk containers and corrugated pallets. Conitex Sonoco has approximately 1,250 employees across 13 manufacturing locations in 10 countries, including four paper mills and seven cone and tube converting operations and two other production facilities. The acquisition of Conitex Sonoco is expected to add approximately $260 million of annual sales in the Company's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment. Also on October 1, 2018, the Company acquired from Texpack Group Holdings B.V. a rigid paper facility in Spain (\"Compositub\") for $10.0 million in cash. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing. This adjustment was settled in February 2019 for an additional cash payment to the seller of $0.4 million. Both the Conitex Sonoco and Compositub acquisitions were funded with existing cash on hand. On April 12, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Highland Packaging Solutions (\"Highland\"). Total consideration for this acquisition was $148.5 million, including net cash paid at closing of $141.0, along with a contingent purchase liability of $7.5 million. The contingent purchase liability is based upon a sales metric which the Company expects to meet and is payable in two installments. The first installment of $5.0 million is to be paid one year after the closing date and the second installment of $2.5 million is to be paid two years after the closing date. The liability for these two payments has been recognized in full on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018, with the first installment included in \"Accrued expenses and other\" and the second in \"Other Liabilities.\" Highland manufactures thermoformed plastic packaging for fresh produce and dairy products from a single production facility in Plant City, Florida, providing total packaging solutions for customers that include sophisticated engineered containers, flexographic printed labels, and inventory management through distribution warehouses in the Southeast and West Coast of the United States. The Company financed the acquisition with proceeds from a new $100.0 million term loan, along with proceeds from existing credit facilities. This loan was repaid in full before the end of 2018. The acquisition of Highland is expected to add approximately $110 million of annual sales in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment.\nThe Company completed two acquisitions during 2017 at a cost of $383.7 million, net of cash acquired. On March 14, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Packaging Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries, including Peninsula Packaging LLC (\"Packaging Holdings\"), for $218.8 million, net of cash acquired. Packaging Holdings manufactures thermoformed packaging for a wide range of whole fresh fruits, pre-cut fruits and produce, prepared salad mixes, as well as baked goods in retail supermarkets from five manufacturing facilities, including four in the United States and one in Mexico. The Company financed the transaction with a combination of cash and borrowings, including a $150.0 million three-year term loan. On July 24, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Clear Lam Packaging, Inc. (\"Clear Lam\") for $165.0 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to an adjustment for working capital, which was completed in 2018 resulting in $1.6 million of cash being returned to the Company. Clear Lam manufactures high barrier flexible and forming films used to package a variety of products for consumer packaged goods companies, retailers and other industrial manufacturers, with a focus on structures used for perishable foods. It has production facilities in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, and Nanjing, China. The Company financed a portion of the transaction with $100 million in borrowings from a $250 million five-year term loan with the remaining purchase price funded from available short-term credit facilities.\nThe Company completed four acquisitions during 2016 at a cost of $88.6 million, net of cash acquired. On June 24, 2016, the Company completed an acquisition in its Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment of a small tube and core business in Australia for $0.9 million in cash. On August 30, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition in its Protective Solutions segment of the temperature-controlled cargo container assets, licenses, trademarks, and manufacturing rights from AAR Corporation. Total consideration for this business was $6.0 million consisting of a current cash payment of $3.0 million, non-contingent deferred cash consideration of $2.0 million, and contingent consideration valued at $1.0 million. Also in the Protective Solutions segment, Laminar Medica (\"Laminar\"), a privately held specialty medical products company based in the U.K., was acquired on September 19, 2016 for $17.2 million, net of cash acquired. On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition in its Consumer Packaging segment of Plastic Packaging Inc. (\"PPI\"), a privately held Hickory, NC-based flexible packaging company for $67.6 million, net of cash acquired. Founded in 1957, PPI specializes in short-run, customized flexible packaging for consumer brands in markets including: food products (i.e. frozen foods, baked goods, seafood), pet products (i.e. dry food, bird seed, litter), confection (i.e. seasonal promotions, heat-sealed chocolate packaging, hard and soft candy), and health and personal care (i.e. nutraceuticals, diapers, tissues/wipes).\nDispositions\nOn November 7, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its rigid plastics blow molding operations to Amcor Rigid Plastics USA, LLC and Amcor Packaging Canada, Inc. for approximately $280 million, with the Company receiving net cash proceeds of $271.8 million. In conjunction with the sale, the Company recognized a gain on the disposition, net of associated fees, of $104.3 million. The Company's rigid plastics blow molding operations included seven manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Canada with approximately 850 employees producing containers serving the personal care and food and beverage markets. The disposition of these operations negatively impacted 2017 over 2016 sales comparisons by approximately $175 million. The decision to sell the blow molding operations was made to focus on, and provide resources to further enhance, the Company's targeted growth businesses, including flexible packaging, thermoformed rigid plastics, and temperature-assurance packaging. This sale did not notably affect operating margin percentages for the Company's Consumer Packaging segment, nor did it represent a strategic shift for the Company having a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about acquisition and disposition activities.\nRestructuring and asset impairment charges\nDue to its geographic footprint (312 locations in 36 countries) and the cost-competitive nature of its businesses, the Company is constantly seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve its customers and to respond to fundamental changes in its markets. As such, restructuring costs have been and are expected to be a recurring component of the Company's operating costs. The amount of these costs can vary significantly from year to year depending upon the scope and location of the restructuring activities.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>20\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table recaps the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges on the Company's net income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exit costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Actions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,638 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 Actions </td> <td>7,176 </td> <td> </td> <td>14,646 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 and Earlier Actions </td> <td>(92) </td> <td> </td> <td>3,756 </td> <td> </td> <td>35,761 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments: </td> <td>5,349 </td> <td> </td> <td>20,017 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,122 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restructuring/asset impairment charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,071 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,419 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,883 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(10,038) </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,064) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,520) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of noncontrolling interests, net of tax\n</td> <td>(191) </td> <td> </td> <td>(71) </td> <td> </td> <td>(161) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total impact of restructuring/asset impairment charges, net of tax </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,842 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,284 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,202 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, the Company announced the closure of a flexible packaging plant in North Carolina, a global brand management facility in Canada, a thermoformed packaging plant in California (all part of the Consumer Packaging segment), five tube and core plants - one in Alabama, one in Canada, one in Indonesia, one in Russia, and one in Norway (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment), and a protective packaging plant in North Carolina (part of the Protective Solutions segment). Restructuring actions in the Display and Packaging segment included charges associated with exiting a single-customer contract at a packaging center near Atlanta, Georgia. In addition the Company continued to realign its cost structure, resulting in the elimination of approximately 120 positions.\nDuring 2017, the Company announced the closure of an expanded foam protective packaging plant in the United States (part of the Protective Solutions segment), five tubes and cores plants - three in the United States, one in Belgium, and one in China (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment), and a packaging services center in Mexico (part of the Display and Packaging segment). Asset impairment charges recorded in 2017 included a $17.8 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 recognized as a result of the Company's decision to shut down its #9 boiler in the Hartsville, South Carolina manufacturing complex. In addition, the Company recognized severance charges throughout 2017 related to the elimination of approximately 185 positions in conjunction with the Company's ongoing organizational effectiveness efforts.\nDuring 2016, the Company announced the closure of four tubes and cores plants - one in the United States, one in Canada, one in Ecuador, and one in Switzerland (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment). The Company closed a packaging services center in Mexico and a fulfillment service center in Brazil (both part of the Display and Packaging segment). The Company also began manufacturing rationalization efforts in its Reels division (part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment), and completed the sales of a paper mill in France (part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment) and a retail security packaging plant in Puerto Rico (part of the Display and Packaging segment). In addition, the Company continued to realign its cost structure, resulting in the elimination of approximately 180 positions.\nThe Company expects to recognize future additional costs totaling approximately $1.8 million in connection with previously announced restructuring actions. The Company believes that the majority of these charges will be incurred and paid by the end of 2019. The Company regularly evaluates its cost structure, including its manufacturing capacity, and additional restructuring actions are likely to be undertaken. Restructuring and asset impairment charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the Company operates.\nSee

$104,292 ($49,341 after tax); $850 increase ($522 after tax) in reserves for Fox River environmental claims; $1,203 net tax loss due primarily to changes in rates and valuation allowances for foreign entities; and other charges totaling $82 ($59 after tax).\nResults of operations - 2018 versus 2017\nNet income attributable to Sonoco (GAAP earnings) was $313.6 million ($3.10 per diluted share) in 2018, compared with $175.3 million ($1.74 per diluted share) in 2017. 2018 earnings reflect net after-tax charges totaling $27.1 million, consisting of restructuring/asset impairment charges and acquisition-related expenses which were partially offset by the tax benefit related to the Tax Act.\nNet income in 2017 was negatively impacted by a net after-tax expense of $106.4 million consisting of pension settlement charges, tax charges related to the Tax Act, restructuring/asset impairment charges, and acquisition-related expenses. These charges were partially offset by insurance settlement gains.\nBase earnings in 2018 were $340.6 million ($3.37 per diluted share), compared with $281.8 million ($2.79 per diluted share) in 2017.\nBoth GAAP and base earnings in 2018 benefited from a positive price/cost relationship, operating profit from businesses acquired during the year and lower income tax rates related to the Tax Act. These year-over-year favorable factors were partially offset by higher management incentives, overhead and other operating costs. Changes in foreign currency translation had little effect on earnings year over year.\nThe effective tax rate on GAAP earnings was 19.8% in 2018, compared with 46.6% in 2017, and the effective tax rate on base earnings was 23.7%, compared with 31.1% in 2017. The GAAP effective tax rate benefited from the $16.1 million release of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits, as well as the absence of the 2017 one-time $77 million charge to record the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings. The decrease in the base tax rate was due to the decrease in the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, partially offset by the new \"GILTI\" tax, both of which are a result of the Tax Act. The 2018 base rate also benefited from an unusually large tax benefit from the payment of equity compensation awards, including the exercise of stock appreciation rights.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>22\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated net sales for 2018 were $5.4 billion, a $354 million, or 7.0%, increase from 2017. The components of the sales change were:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume/mix </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling price </td> <td>63 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions and divestitures, net </td> <td>241 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation and other, net </td> <td>(4) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales increase </td> <td>$ </td> <td>354 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales volume/mix was up approximately 1% driven by increases in the Display and Packaging Segment. Higher selling prices year-over-year were implemented to recover rising material prices, mostly resins. This led to year-over-year increases in all of the Company's segments, except the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment where market prices for the segment's primary raw material, old corrugated containers (\"OCC\"), declined from 2017 to 2018. The Company's 2018 acquisitions added more than $241 million to comparable year-over-year sales. Finally, foreign exchange rate changes increased year-over-year sales as almost all of the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business strengthened slightly in relation to the U.S. Dollar.\nTotal domestic sales were $3.5 billion, up 6.9% from 2017 levels. International sales were $1.9 billion, up 7.2% from 2017 with most of the increase driven by growth in the Company's industrial businesses.\nCosts and expenses/margins\nCost of sales was up $271.9 million in 2018, or 6.7%, from the prior year primarily due to additional volume from acquired businesses. Positive price/cost relationship and modest productivity improvements resulted in gross profit margins increasing to 19.3% in 2018 from 19.0% in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $55.5 million, or 10.9%, and were 10.4% of sales compared to 10.1% of sales in 2017. The current year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is largely attributable to selling, general, and administrative expenses associated with acquired businesses along with higher management incentives and general wage inflation. Additionally, acquisition-related costs increased $0.7 million from last year to $14.4 million.\nGAAP operating profit was 8.1% of sales in 2018 compared to 8.2% in 2017. Base operating profit declined slightly to 9.1% of sales in 2018 compared to 9.2% in 2017. Both GAAP and base operating profit were essentially flat year over year. The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin discussed above was offset by selling, general and administrative expenses discussed above.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges totaled $40.1 million and $38.4 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additional information regarding restructuring actions and impairments is provided in Note 5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAggregate pension and postretirement plan expenses decreased $43.6 million in 2018 to a total of $34.9 million, compared with $78.5 million in 2017. In February 2017, the Company initiated a program to settle a portion of its pension liability related to terminated vested participants in the U.S. qualified retirement plans through either a single, lump-sum payment or the purchase of an annuity. During the course of the program, the Company successfully settled approximately 47% of the projected benefit obligation of the terminated vested plan participants. As a result of these and other smaller settlements, the Company recognized non-cash settlement charges totaling $32.8 million in 2017; similar charges were only $0.7 million in 2018. The settlement charges are reflected in non-operating pension costs, and account for the majority of the year-over-year decrease in pension and postretirement plan expenses. The remainder of pension and postretirement plan expenses are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income with approximately 75% in cost of sales and 25% in selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on employee benefit plans.\nNet interest expense totaled $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $52.7 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates.\nReportable segments\nThe Company reports its financial results in four reportable segments - Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.\nConsolidated operating profits, reported as Operating Profit\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Income, are comprised of the following:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer Packaging </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>255.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Display and Packaging </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>411.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paper and Industrial Converted Products </td> <td>211.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>161.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Protective Solutions </td> <td>42.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring/Asset impairment charges </td> <td>(40.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related costs </td> <td>(14.5) </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.8) </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-operational (charges)/income, net </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>(82.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated operating profit* </td> <td>$ </td> <td>437.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>6.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*Due to rounding, amounts above may not foot </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment results viewed by Company management to evaluate segment performance do not include restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related charges, gains or losses from the sale of businesses, pension settlement charges, specifically identified tax adjustments, and certain other items, if any, the exclusion of which the Company believes improves comparability and analysis. Accordingly, the term segment operating profits\u201d is defined as the segment's portion of Income before interest and income taxes\u201d excluding those items. General corporate expenses, with the exception of restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related charges, net interest expense and income taxes, have been allocated as operating costs to each of the Company's reportable segments.\nSee Note 18 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on reportable segments.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>23\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsumer Packaging\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,360.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,123.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>11.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>224.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>255.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>116.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>98.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>66.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>63.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales increased year over year due to the April 12, 2018 acquisition of Highland Packaging, the October 1, 2018 acquisition of a composite can plant in Spain, and the full-year impact of the March 14, 2017 acquisition of Packaging Holdings and the July 24, 2017 acquisition of Clear Lam. Higher selling prices in most of the segment's businesses, driven largely by raw material price increases, were partially reduced by lower demand in Global Plastics. Foreign currency translation added approximately $14 million to segment trade sales year over year due to a weaker U.S. dollar. Domestic sales were approximately $1,676 million, up 12.9%, or $191 million, from 2017, while international sales were approximately $684 million, up 7.2%, or $46 million, from 2017.\nSegment operating profits decreased by $31.3 million year over year and operating profit margins of 9.5% were down 253 basis points from 2017. The decreases in segment operating profits and operating profit margins were largely driven by volume declines in Global Plastics and the negative impact of changes in mix of products in Global Rigid Paper Containers. These volume declines led to manufacturing inefficiencies. The Company is in the process of refocusing certain operations and is optimistic that it will improve manufacturing performance and better leverage the fixed cost profile. The negative impact of volume declines and manufacturing inefficiencies was partially offset by the positive impact of price cost and increases from acquired businesses.\nCapital spending in the segment included numerous productivity projects and expansion of manufacturing capabilities in North America (primarily flexible packaging and plastics) and in Europe (primarily rigid paper containers).\nDisplay and Packaging\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>592.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>508.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>405.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>23.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic trade sales in the segment increased $41 million, or 16.5%, to $290 million, while international trade sales increased $43 million, or 16.6%, to $302 million. The increase in domestic trade sales resulted from increased volume at our new retail packaging fulfillment center in Atlanta, Georgia, offset by lower volume in retail security packaging. The increase in international sales reflects the increases in activity at the Company's packaging center in Poland as well as the positive impact of approximately $13 million from foreign currency translation as a result of a stronger Polish zloty relative to the U.S. dollar year over year. The increase in segment operating profit was largely due to increased volumes both domestically and internationally. These increases were offset by continued losses at the new retail packaging fulfillment center in Atlanta, Georgia. Despite continued improvements at this packaging center, the Company determined that it could not achieve acceptable margins under the single-customer contract associated with this facility and in the third quarter of 2018 exited the contract.\nCapital spending in the segment was driven by customer development and productivity related projects, coupled with capacity expansion in Europe.\nPaper and Industrial Converted Products\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,911.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,866.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>211.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>161.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>30.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>74.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>74.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>91.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>61.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>48.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe main driver of the year-over-year increase in sales was the acquisition of the remaining 70 percent interest in the Conitex Sonoco joint venture on October 1, 2018. Conitex Sonoco's sales for the last three months of 2018 were approximately $62 million. This increase was offset by volume declines in many of our tubes and cores businesses as well as an overall decline in sales price as market prices for OCC on the whole were down from the previous year. Total domestic sales in the segment decreased $19 million, or 1.7%, to $1,109 million while international sales increased $64 million, or 8.7%, to $802 million.\nSegment operating profit increased year over year, driven by a positive price/cost relationship as the Company benefited from a strong global paper market and global commercial excellence initiatives. The positive price/cost relationship was partially offset by higher management incentives as well as wage and other fixed cost inflation.\nAlthough conditions improved for the corrugating medium operation in 2018, the Company continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for this operation.\nSignificant capital spending in the segment included the modification of several paper machines in North America, numerous productivity projects, and IT investments.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>24\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProtective Solutions\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>527.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>538.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>42.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>27.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>19.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>(69.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales declined slightly year over year,impacted mostly by volume declines in automotive components, consumer electronics and appliances offset by volume gains in temperature-assured packaging and price increases.\nSegment operating profit increased year over year due to a positive price/cost relationship and manufacturing productivity.\nDomestic sales were $415 million in 2018 down $11 million, or 3%, from 2017. International sales were flat at $113 million.\nCapital spending in the segment included numerous productivity initiatives as well as customer-related projects in our expanded foam protective packaging and temperature-assured packaging businesses.\nFinancial position, liquidity and capital resources\nCash flow\nOperating activities\nCash flow from operations totaled $589.9 million in 2018 and $348.3 million in 2017. The year-over-year cash flow increase of $241.6 million is attributable to the $137.3 million increase in GAAP Net Income, which was discussed above under Results of Operations, as well as the factors discussed here. Lower pension and postretirement expenses and decreased pension and postretirement cash contributions resulted in a combined year-over-year increase in operating cash flows of $39.6 million. Working capital provided $27.7 million in 2018 compared to consuming $55.6 million in 2017; this $83.3 million additional cash provision was largely driven by changes in accounts receivable. Accounts receivable, net of acquisitions, grew in 2017 due to a combination of extended customer terms, changes in mix of sales, and the timing of collections from certain customers. Conversely, in 2018, Accounts Receivable, net of acquisitions, decreased due to improved collection efforts throughout the year. Additionally, inventory consumed more cash in 2017 due to pre-buying certain raw materials at the end of 2017 in anticipation of price increases.\nNon-cash asset impairment charges were $14.2 million lower year over year, due largely to the fourth quarter 2017 impairment of a power generating facility at the Company's Hartsville manufacturing complex, which was closed down in the first quarter of 2018 after being rendered obsolete by the Company's new biomass facility. Similar charges did not repeat in 2018. The net benefit from changes in deferred income tax and income tax payable balances was $78.1 million lower in 2018 compared with the previous year. The year-over-year decrease is attributable to the significant changes in 2017 associated with the Tax Act. These changes included recording a liability for the new transition tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the Company's net deferred tax liabilities which were reduced as a result of the decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. While the Company continued to refine income tax assets and liabilities during 2018, changes in 2018 were not as significant as in 2017. Non-cash share-based compensation expenses were $2.8 million lower year over year as expenses recognized in association with our performance-based awards decreased, reflecting assumptions about actual performance against targeted performance metrics over the vesting period of the awards. Net losses on disposition of assets totaled $8.6 million in 2018 compared with $2.0 million in 2017, a year-over-year change of $6.6 million, driven by the loss on the exit from a contract to operate a packaging center in Atlanta. The Company's 2018 acquisition of Conitex resulted in a fair value assessment loss of $4.8 million on the Company's previously-held minority interest. Changes in accrued expenses reflect a $19.2 million provision of cash in 2018 compared with a $14.6 million use of cash in 2017. The greater provision in 2018 is primarily due to the higher year-over-year management incentives and other accrued expenses. Additionally, the 2017 provision was lower than normal due to a non-recurring payment of an environmental settlement in 2017. Changes in other assets and liabilities used $18.9 million less cash in 2018 compared to 2017. This year-over-year decreased consumption is largely attributable to the collection of various other receivables outstanding at the end of 2017. Similar levels of miscellaneous receivable items were not outstanding at the end of 2018. Cash paid for income taxes was $6.5 million higher year over year, which was due primarily to the timing of payments and the transition tax imposed by the Tax Act which is payable over a period of eight years.\nCash flow from operations totaled $348.3 million in 2017 and $398.7 million in 2016, a year-over-year decrease of $50.4 million. The $110.4 million decline in GAAP Net Income reflects the non-recurrence of the 2016 gain on the sale of the Company's rigid plastics blow molding operations of $108.7 million, the cash impact of which was reported as an investing activity. 2017 net income also reflects higher pension and postretirement expenses and increased pension and postretirement cash contributions resulting in a combined year-over-year decrease in operating cash flows of $28.6 million. Working capital consumed $5.0 million more cash in 2017 than in 2016. Changes in inventory used $16.1 million of cash in 2017 versus $11.5 million in 2016, a higher year-over-year use of cash of $4.6 million, primarily attributable to pre-buying of certain raw materials at the end of 2017 in anticipation of upcoming price increases. The combined changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable balances consumed approximately $39 million of cash from operations in both 2017 and 2016. The increases in year-end accounts receivable balances over the respective prior years were due to a combination of factors including the timing of collections from certain customers, changes in terms and sales mix by customer, and changes in selling prices. Non-cash asset impairment charges were $12.9 million higher year over year, due largely to the fourth quarter 2017 impairment of a power generating facility at the Company's Hartsville manufacturing complex, which was determined to have been rendered obsolete by the Company's new biomass facility and closed in the first quarter of 2018. The net benefit from changes in deferred income tax and income tax payable balances was $25.1 million greater in 2017 compared with the previous year. The year-over-year increase is attributable to the Tax Act, including the recording of a liability for the new transition tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the Company's net deferred tax liabilities which were reduced as a result of the decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. Non-cash share-based compensation expenses were $5.8 million lower year over year as expenses recognized in association with our performance-based awards decreased, reflecting assumptions about actual performance against targeted performance metrics over the vesting period of the awards. Net losses on disposition of assets totaled $2.0 million in 2017 compared with $14.2 million in 2016, a year-over-year change of $12.1 million, driven by the loss on the disposition of a paperboard mill in France in 2016. Changes in accrued expenses reflect a $14.6 million use of cash in 2017 compared with an $11.7 million use of cash in 2016. The year-over-year change of $2.9 million was primarily driven by the final settlement of Fox River-related environmental claims in January 2017 and lower management incentive accruals. Changes in other assets and liabilities used $37.1 million of additional cash in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by $16.0 million in timing differences related to certain non-income tax payments, $7.0 million related to the timing of costs and associated reimbursements related to the relocation of a facility, and a net change of $5.7 million in the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with certain\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>25\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\ncustomers. Cash paid for income taxes was $37.8 million lower year over year due primarily to the payment in 2016 of taxes arising from the gain on the sale of the rigid plastics blow molding operations.\nInvesting activities\nCash used by investing activities was $444.1 million in 2018, compared with $564.6 million in 2017. The decline in year-over-year use of cash is due in part to decreased year-over-year acquisition activity. The Company's various 2018 acquisitions consumed $277.2 million, whereas acquisition spending in 2017 was higher at $383.7 million. Also contributing to the year-over-year decrease in cash used by investing activities is an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets. Proceeds in 2018 totaled $24.3 million and included $17.2 million from the September 2018 sale of equipment relating to a single-customer contract packaging operation near Atlanta, Georgia, less a contract termination fee. Proceeds from disposals in 2017 totaled $5.3 million. Capital spending was $192.6 million in 2018, compared with $188.9 million in 2017, a decrease of $3.7 million. Capital spending is expected to total approximately $205 million in 2019.\nCash used in investing activities was $564.6 million in 2017, compared with $3.1 million in 2016. The higher year-over-year use of cash is due to a net $275.1 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets. Proceeds in 2016 included $271.8 million from the November 2016 sale of the Company's rigid plastics blow molding operations, partially offset by cash paid for the disposal of a paper operation in France. Acquisition spending, net of cash acquired, was $295.1 million higher year-over-year as 2017 included the acquisitions of Packing Holdings and Clear Lam, each of which was more meaningful than the acquisition activity in 2016. Capital spending was $188.9 million in 2017, compared with $186.7 million in 2016, an increase of $2.2 million.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used by financing activities increased $476.9 million year over year as financing activities used $273.7 million of cash in 2018, compared with a provision of cash totaling $203.2 million in 2017. The year-over-year change was driven primarily by lower net borrowings in 2018 compared to 2017. In both years borrowings were used mostly to provide capital for acquisitions; however, 2018 acquisition activity was less than in 2017 and a greater portion of 2018 activity was funded by cash on hand. Outstanding debt was $1,385.2 million at December 31, 2018 compared with at $1,447.3 million at December 31, 2017. Cash dividends increased 5.4% to $161.4 million in 2018 compared to $153.1 million in 2017, reflecting a $0.02 per share increase in the quarterly dividend payment approved by the Board of Directors in April 2018. On December 31, 2018, the Company paid $35.0 million to purchase a joint venture partner's non-controlling interest in an Asian joint venture.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $203.2 million in 2017 compared with a use of $315.7 million in 2016, an increased provision of cash of $518.9 million. This increase was driven primarily by increased net borrowings which totaled $355.2 million in 2017 compared to net repayments of $65.1 million in 2016. Additionally, in 2016 the Company used $106.7 million of cash to repurchase 2.2 million shares of the Company's common stock under an announced buy-back program. The Company did not repurchase shares under this program in 2017. Outstanding debt was $1,447.3 million at December 31, 2017 compared with $1,128.4 million at at December 31, 2016. These balances reflect net borrowings of $355.2 million during the 12 months ending December 31, 2017. Cash dividends increased 4.6% to $153.1 million compared to $146.4 million in 2016, reflecting a $0.02 per share increase in the quarterly dividend payment approved by the Board of Directors in April 2017.\nCurrent assets decreased year over year by $44.4 million to $1,519.3 million at December 31, 2018, and current liabilities increased by $83.0 million to $1,083 million, resulting in a decrease in the Company's current ratio to 1.4 at December 31, 2018 from 1.6 at December 31, 2017. The decrease in current assets was largely due to the use of cash on hand to fund the Conitex acquisition and decreases in working capital both of which were partially offset by an increase from current assets related to acquired businesses. The slight increase in current liabilities was mostly due current liabilities associated with acquired businesses.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations at December 31, 2018:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due In </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020-2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022-2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>Beyond 2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>Uncertain </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,385.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>195.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>457.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>606.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments1\n</td> <td>821.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>90.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>69.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>615.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td>263.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition tax under Tax Act2\n</td> <td>61.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>30.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax contingencies3\n</td> <td>15.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations4\n</td> <td>164.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>81.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>67.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations5\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,711.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>371.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>702.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>278.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,344.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.1 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Includes interest payments on outstanding fixed-rate, long-term debt obligations, as well as financing fees on the backstop line of credit. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>The Company recognized a transition tax of $80.6 million on certain accumulated foreign earnings in order to comply with the Tax Act.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately $102.3 million and $238.4 million, respectively, of the Company's reported cash and cash equivalents balances of $120.4 million and $254.9 million, respectively, were held outside of the United States by its foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside of the United States is available to meet local liquidity needs, or for capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other offshore growth opportunities. As the Company enjoys ample domestic liquidity through a combination of operating cash flow generation and access to bank and capital markets borrowings, we have generally considered our foreign unremitted earnings to be indefinitely invested outside the United States and currently have no plans to repatriate such earnings, other than excess cash balances that can be repatriated at minimal tax cost. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, the Company is not providing for taxes on these amounts for financial reporting purposes. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with unremitted earnings deemed to be indefinitely reinvested is not practicable.\nThe Company's total debt at December 31, 2018, was $1,385 million, a year-over-year decrease of $62 million driven primarily by the $88 million repayment of the $250 million term loan used to finance the Clear Lam and Packaging Holdings acquisitions which was partially offset by an increase in foreign debt. The Company had $120 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2018 and $124 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company operates a $350 million commercial paper program, supported by a $500 million five-year revolving credit facility. In July 2017, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of eight banks for that revolving facility, together with a $250 million five-year term loan. The revolving bank credit facility is committed through July 2022. If circumstances were to prevent the Company from issuing commercial paper, it has the contractual right to draw funds directly on the underlying revolving bank credit facility. Borrowings under the credit agreement may be prepaid at any time at the discretion of the Company and the term loan has amortization payments totaling $12.5 million per year. During 2018, the Company prepaid an additional $75 million of the term loan. On April 12, 2018, the Company entered into a new $100 million, 364-day term loan facility in conjunction with the purchase of Highland Packaging. The Company subsequently repaid this loan in its entirety over the second and third quarters of 2018 using cash generated from operations.\nThe Company uses a notional pooling arrangement with an international bank to help manage global liquidity requirements. Under this pooling arrangement, the Company and its participating subsidiaries may maintain either a cash deposit or borrowing position through local currency accounts with the bank, so long as the aggregate position of the global pool is a notionally calculated net cash deposit. Because it maintains a security interest in the cash deposits, and has the right to offset the cash deposits against the borrowings, the bank provides the Company and its participating subsidiaries favorable interest terms on both.\nAcquisitions and internal investments are key elements of the Company's growth strategy. The Company believes that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity will enable it to support this strategy. Although the Company believes that it has excess borrowing capacity beyond its current lines, there can be no assurance that such financing would be available or, if so, at terms that are acceptable to the Company.\nThe net underfunded position of the Company's various U.S and international defined benefit pension and postretirement plans was approximately $369 million at the end of 2018. During 2018, the Company contributed approximately $25 million to its benefit plans. The Company anticipates that benefit plan contributions in 2019 will total approximately $31 million. Future funding requirements will depend largely on actual investment returns and future actuarial assumptions. Participation in the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan is frozen for salaried and non-union hourly U.S. employees hired on or after January 1, 2004. In February 2009, the plan was further amended to freeze service credit earned effective December 31, 2018. This change is expected to moderately reduce the volatility of long-term funding exposure and expenses.\nTotal equity increased $42 million during 2018 as net income of $315 million was partially offset by an other comprehensive loss of $77 million, dividends of $163 million, purchase of a noncontrolling interest of $35 million, stock-based compensation of $11 million and share repurchases of $15 million. The primary components of other comprehensive loss were a $55 million translation loss from the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the Company's foreign investments and additional actuarial losses totaling $20 million, net of tax, in the Company's various defined benefit plans resulting primarily from lower than expected market performance of plan assets in 2018. Total equity increased $175 million during 2017 as net income of $177 million and other comprehensive income totaling $146 million were partially offset by dividends of $155 million, stock-based compensation of $13 million and share repurchases of $6 million. The primary components of other comprehensive gain were an $89 million translation gain from the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on the Company's foreign investments and additional actuarial gains totaling $60 million, net of tax, in the Company's various defined benefit plans resulting primarily from higher than expected market performance of plan assets in 2017.\nOn February 10, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million shares of the Company's common stock. During 2016, a total of 2.03 million shares were repurchased under this authorization at a cost of $100 million. No shares were repurchased under this authorization during 2017 or 2018. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018 a total of 2.97 million shares remain available for repurchase under this authorization.\nAlthough the ultimate determination of whether to pay dividends is within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company plans to increase dividends as earnings grow. Dividends per common share were $1.62 in 2018, $1.54 in 2017 and $1.46 in 2016. On February 13, 2019, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.41 per common share payable on March 8, 2019, to shareholders of record on February 27, 2019.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nThe Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2018.\nRisk management\nAs a result of operating globally, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The exposure is well diversified, as the Company's facilities are spread throughout the world, and the Company generally sells in the same countries where it produces. The Company monitors these exposures and may use traditional currency swaps and forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, foreign currency assets and liabilities or net investment in foreign subsidiaries. The Company's foreign operations are exposed to political and cultural risks, but the risks are mitigated by diversification and the relative stability of the countries in which the Company has significant operations.\nPrior to July 1, 2015, the Company used Venezuela's official exchange rate to report the results of its operations in Venezuela. As a result of significant inflationary increases, and to avoid distortion of its consolidated results from translation of its Venezuelan operations, effective July 1, 2015, the Company began translating its Venezuelan operating results and all monetary assets and liabilities in Venezuela using an alternative rate (currently known as the DICOM rate). At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the Company's net investment in its Venezuelan operations was approximately $2.0 million. In addition, at December 31, 2018, the Company's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss included\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>27\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\na cumulative translation loss of $3.8 million related to its Venezuela operations which would need to be reclassified to net income in the event of a complete exit of the business or a deconsolidation of these operations.\nThe Company is a purchaser of various raw material inputs such as recovered paper, energy, steel, aluminum and plastic resin. The Company generally does not engage in significant hedging activities for these purchases, other than for energy and, from time to time, aluminum, because there is usually a high correlation between the primary input costs and the ultimate selling price of its products. Inputs are generally purchased at market or at fixed prices that are established with individual suppliers as part of the purchase process for quantities expected to be consumed in the ordinary course of business. On occasion, where the correlation between selling price and input price is less direct, the Company may enter into derivative contracts such as futures or swaps to manage the effect of price fluctuations.\nIn addition, the Company may, from time to time, use traditional, unleveraged interest-rate swaps to manage its mix of fixed and variable rate debt and to control its exposure to interest rate movements within select ranges.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had derivative contracts outstanding to hedge the price on a portion of anticipated commodity and energy purchases as well as to hedge certain foreign exchange risks for various periods through December 2019. These contracts included swaps to hedge the purchase price of approximately 7.0 million MMBTUs of natural gas in the U.S. and Canada representing approximately 71% and 31% of anticipated natural gas usage for 2019 and 2020. Additionally, the Company had swap contracts covering 4,082 metric tons of aluminum representing approximately 51% of anticipated usage for 2019. The aluminum hedges relate to fixed-price customer contracts. At December 31, 2018, the Company had a number of foreign currency contracts in place for both designated and undesignated hedges of either anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions or existing financial assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of these contracts, in U.S. dollar terms, was $147 million, of which $65 million related to the Canadian dollar, $40 million to the Mexican peso, $19 million to the Polish Zloty and $23 million to all other currencies.\nThe total fair market value of the Company's derivatives was a net unfavorable position of $3.1 million and $1.3 million at at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. Derivatives are marked to fair value using published market prices, if available, or using estimated values based on current price quotes and a discounted cash flow model. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on financial instruments.\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, solid waste disposal, wastewater effluent and air emissions. Although the costs of compliance have not been significant due to the nature of the materials and processes used in manufacturing operations, such laws also make generators of hazardous wastes and their legal successors financially responsible for the cleanup of sites contaminated by those wastes. The Company has been named a potentially responsible party at several environmentally contaminated sites. These regulatory actions and a small number of private party lawsuits are believed to represent the Company's largest potential environmental liabilities. The Company has accrued $20.1 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $20.3 million at December 31, 2017, with respect to these sites. See Environmental Charges,\u201d Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on environmental matters.\nResults of operations - 2017 versus 2016\nConsolidated net sales for 2017 were $5.0 billion, a $254 million, or 5.3%, increase from 2016. The components of the sales change were:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume/mix </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling price </td> <td>182 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions and divestitures, net </td> <td>69 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation and other, net </td> <td>22 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales increase </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales volume/mix was essentially flat as organic volume growth and a favorable change in product mix in a number of our businesses mostly offset volume declines in rigid paper containers and automotive components. For the most part, price changes for the Company's products were driven by changes in the underlying raw materials costs. In 2017, many of the Company's primary raw materials saw increases in their market prices; especially OCC which saw an average increase of more than 50% year over year. This increase most directly affected the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment while the increase in other raw materials, mainly resins, most directly affected the Consumer Packaging segment. While the full-year average OCC price was up year over year, prices during the year were volatile with periods of sharp increases and decreases resulting in significant margin swings. However, the Company was able to achieve an overall positive price cost relationship. While the Company's 2017 and 2016 acquisitions added more than $259 million to comparable year-over-year sales, the impact was mostly offset by sales decreases of $191 million related to dispositions, the most significant of which was the 2016 sale of the Company's rigid plastics blow molding operations. Finally, foreign exchange rate changes increased year-over-year sales as almost all of the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business strengthened slightly in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nTotal domestic sales were $3.3 billion, up 4.9% from 2016 levels. International sales were $1.8 billion, up 6.1% from 2016 with most of the increase driven by growth in the Company's industrial businesses and the impact of foreign currency translation.\nCosts and expenses/margins\nCost of sales was up $241.4 million in 2017, or 6.3%, from the prior year primarily due to raw material price increases and additional volume from acquired businesses, net of disposed businesses. Despite the positive price/cost relationship and modest productivity improvements, an unfavorable mix of sales and higher labor and other costs resulted in gross profit margins declining to 19.0% in 2017 from 19.8% in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.8 million, or 0.9%, and were 10.1% of sales compared to 10.5% of sales in 2016. Acquisition-related costs increased $9.2 million from 2016 to $13.8 million. Absent this item, selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat year over year.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges totaled $38.4 million and $42.9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additional information regarding restructuring actions and impairments is provided in Note 5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGAAP operating profit was 8.2% of sales in 2017 compared to 10.6% in 2016. The largest contributor to this decline was the 2016 gain on the sale of the Company's rigid plastics blow molding business. Base operating profit declined to 9.2% of sales in 2017 compared to 9.4% in 2016. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin discussed above contributed to the declines in both GAAP operating profit and Base operating profit.\nNon-operating pension costs increased $33.3 million in 2017 to a total of $45.1 million, compared with $11.8 million in 2016. In February 2017, the Company initiated a program to settle a portion of its pension liability related to terminated vested participants in the U.S. qualified retirement plans through either a single, lump-sum payment or the purchase of an annuity. During the course of the program, the Company\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>28\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nsuccessfully settled approximately 47% of the projected benefit obligation of the terminated vested plan participants. As a result of these and other smaller settlements, the Company recognized non-cash settlement charges totaling $32.8 million in 2017.\nResearch and development costs, all of which were charged to expense, were $21 million in 2017 and $22.5 million in 2016.\nNet interest expense totaled $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $51.6 million in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher average debt levels as the Company used debt to fund acquisitions.\nReportable segments\nThe Company reports its financial results in four reportable segments - Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.\nConsolidated operating profits, reported as Operating profit\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Income, are comprised of the following:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer Packaging </td> <td>$ </td> <td>255.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>245.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Display and Packaging </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>(82.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paper and Industrial Converted Products </td> <td>161.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>136.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Protective Solutions </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>51.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring/Asset impairment charges </td> <td>(38.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>(42.9) </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related costs </td> <td>(13.8) </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.6) </td> <td> </td> <td>200.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-operational gains, net </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>103.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>(97.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated operating profits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>504.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsumer Packaging\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,123.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,043.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>255.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>245.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>98.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>88.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>63.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>86.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales increased year over year due to the March 14, 2017 acquisition of Packaging Holdings, the July 24, 2017 acquisition of Clear Lam and the full year impact of the November 1, 2016 acquisition of PPI. These increases were substantially offset by the reduction in year-over-year sales due to the November 2016 disposition of the Company's rigid plastic blow molding operations. Higher selling prices in most of the segment's businesses, driven largely by raw material price increases, were mostly offset by volume declines in Rigid Paper Containers North America and Europe as well as Flexible Packaging. Foreign currency translation added approximately $5 million to segment trade sales year over year due to a weaker U.S. dollar. Domestic sales were approximately $1,461 million, up 6.8%, or $93 million, from 2016, while international sales were approximately $663 million, down 1.9%, or $13 million, from 2016.\nSegment operating profits increased by $10.0 million year over year and operating profit margins of 12.0% were unchanged from 2016. The increase in segment operating profits was largely driven by solid gains in manufacturing productivity and the positive impact of the relationship between selling prices and costs. These benefits were partially offset by volume declines in global composite cans and flexible packaging as well as inflation. Material purchasing and logistics savings were key drivers of the positive price/cost relationship. At an operating profit level, the negative impact of divestitures somewhat exceeded the benefit of acquisitions largely due to timing.\nCapital spending in the segment included numerous productivity projects and expansion of manufacturing capabilities in North America primarily in flexible packaging and plastics, and expansion of manufacturing capabilities in Europe in rigid paper containers.\nDisplay and Packaging\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>508.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>520.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>(82.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>16.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>23.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>107.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic trade sales in the segment increased $3.2 million, or 1.3%, to $249 million, while international trade sales decreased $15 million, or 5.6%, to $259 million. The increase in domestic trade sales resulted from increased volume at our new retail packaging fulfillment center in Atlanta, Georgia, offset by lower volume in retail security packaging and the impact of the July 2016 sale of our retail security packaging facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. The decrease in international sales reflects the Company's exit from a packaging center fulfillment contract with a customer resulting in the transition of the operation of certain facilities in Mexico and Brazil back to the customer during the first half of 2016. This decline in sales was somewhat offset by the positive impact of approximately $10 million from foreign currency translation as a result of a stronger Polish zloty relative to the U.S. dollar year over year.\nThe decrease in segment operating profit was largely due to inefficiencies and higher than expected operating costs associated with the ramp up of production at the new pack center in Atlanta. Higher than anticipated production requirements, primarily in response to multiple hurricanes, exceeded the new facility's capability to operate efficiently with the installed equipment and a relatively inexperienced workforce that has also incurred a higher than expected turnover rate.\nCapital spending in the segment was driven by a significant customer development project in North America coupled with expansion of manufacturing capabilities in Europe.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>29\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPaper and Industrial Converted Products\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,866.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,693.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>161.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>136.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>18.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>74.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>74.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>61.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>60.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn average, market costs for recovered paper in the U.S. were higher year over year resulting in higher average selling prices in all of the segment's domestic businesses. Selling prices were also higher in Brazil and the Andean region, primarily due to overall inflation, and were up in Europe due to the pass through of higher material costs in that market. Total volume/mix gains were modest in the segment as gains in Europe, which were due to a combination of market share gains and regional expansion, and volume increases in US and Canadian Paper were mostly offset by volume declines in other businesses, particularly US and Canadian Tubes and Cores and Recycling. Changes in foreign exchange rates had little impact on reported sales in the segment. Total domestic sales in the segment increased $103 million, or 10.1%, to $1,128 million while international sales increased $70 million, or 10.4%, to $739 million.\nSegment operating profit increased year over year, driven by a positive price/cost relationship as the Company was able to favorably navigate dramatic movements in Old Corrugated Containers (OCC) market prices. Improved market conditions resulted in a strong turnaround in the Company's corrugating medium operation in 2017. Operating profit was also benefited by increases in volume and positive changes in the mix of products sold, mostly in Europe and Sonoco Reels, and modest productivity gains. These favorable factors were partially offset by wage and other fixed cost inflation.\nAlthough conditions improved for the corrugating medium operation in 2017, and the Company's outlook for the operation is for continued improvement in 2018, the Company continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for this operation.\nSignificant capital spending in the segment included the modification of several paper machines in North America, numerous productivity projects, and IT investments.\nProtective Solutions\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions) </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>538.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>525.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profits </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>51.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion and amortization </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital spending </td> <td>19.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>48.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales increased year over year due to the acquisitions of Laminar Medica and AAR Corporation, each of which was acquired in the second half of 2016. Higher sales prices were offset by volume declines, mostly in automotive components.\nSegment operating profit decreased year over year due to volume declines and associated productivity losses. A negative price/cost relationship and increases in labor, overhead and other costs also negatively impacted profits year over year.\nDomestic sales were $426 million in 2017 down $10 million, or 2%, from 2016. International sales increased to $113 million up $23 million, or 26%. The increase in international sales was driven by prior-year acquisitions.\nCapital spending in the segment included significant customer development projects to support our temperature-assured packaging business.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to those related to inventories, bad debts, derivatives, income taxes, share-based compensation, goodwill, intangible assets, restructuring, pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, and contingencies and litigation. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The impact of and any associated risks related to estimates, assumptions and accounting policies are discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions and accounting policies affect the Company's reported and expected financial results.\nThe Company believes the accounting policies discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are critical to understanding the results of its operations. The following discussion represents those policies that involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company's acquisitions of businesses are accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, \"Business Combinations.\" The Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquired business at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred, also measured at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities including those related to debt, pensions and other postretirement plans, uncertain tax positions, contingent consideration and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of acquired customer relationships, technology, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>30\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nprojections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired asset could be impaired.\nImpairment of long-lived, intangible and other assets\nAssumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of potential impairment can result in adjustments affecting the carrying values of long-lived, intangible and other assets and the recognition of impairment expense in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment), definite-lived intangible assets and other assets (including notes receivable and equity investments) for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist, or when it commits to sell the asset. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long-lived asset or definite-lived intangible asset group is less than the carrying value of that asset group, an asset impairment charge is recognized. Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model generally include price levels, sales growth, profit margins and asset life. The amount of an impairment charge, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, generally represented by the discounted future cash flows from that asset or, in the case of assets the Company evaluates for sale, as estimated proceeds less costs to sell. The Company takes into consideration historical data and experience together with all other relevant information available when estimating the fair values of its assets. However, fair values that could be realized in actual transactions may differ from the estimates used to evaluate impairment. In addition, changes in the assumptions and estimates may result in a different conclusion regarding impairment.\nImpairment of goodwill\nThe Company assesses its goodwill for impairment annually and from time to time when warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding individual reporting units or the Company as a whole. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment charge to goodwill is recognized for the excess. The Company's reporting units are the same as, or one level below, its operating segments, as determined in accordance with ASC 350.\nThe Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of 2018. For testing purposes, the Company's assessment of each reporting unit's estimated fair value and likelihood of impairment included both a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The quantitative tests, described further below, considered factors such as current year operating performance as compared to prior projections and implied fair values from comparable trading and transaction multiples. The qualitative evaluations considered factors such as the macroeconomic environment, Company stock price and market capitalization movement, business strategy changes, and significant customer wins and losses.\nWhen performing a quantitative analysis, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on projections of future years' operating results and associated cash flows, validated by observed comparable trading and transaction multiples. The Company's model discounts projected future cash flows, forecasted over a ten-year period, with an estimated residual growth rate. The Company's projections incorporate management's estimates of the most-likely expected future results, including significant assumptions and estimates related to, among other things: sales volumes and prices, new business, profit margins, income taxes, capital expenditures, changes in working capital requirements and operating margins and application of a discount rate. Projected future cash flows are discounted to present value using an assumed discount rate that management believes is appropriate for the reporting unit.\nThe Company's assessments, whether qualitative or quantitative, incorporate management's expectations for the future, including forecasted growth rates and/or margin improvements. Therefore, should there be changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and/or expectations, management's conclusion regarding goodwill impairment may change as well. Management's projections related to revenue growth and/or margin improvements are based on a combination of factors, including expectations for volume growth with existing customers and customer retention, product expansion, changes in price/cost relationships, productivity gains, fixed cost leverage, and stability or improvement in general\neconomic conditions.\nIn considering the level of uncertainty regarding the potential for goodwill impairment, management has concluded that any such impairment would, in most cases, likely be the result of adverse changes in more than one assumption. Management considers the assumptions used to be its best estimates across a range of possible outcomes based on available evidence at the time of the assessment. Other than in Display and Packaging, which is discussed below, there is no specific singular event or single change in circumstances management has identified that it believes could reasonably result in a change to expected future results in any of its reporting units sufficient to result in goodwill impairment. In\nmanagement's opinion, a change of such magnitude would more likely be the result of changes to some combination of the factors identified above, a general deterioration in competitive position, introduction of a superior technology, significant unexpected changes in customer preferences, an inability to pass through significant raw material cost increases, and other such items as identified in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" on pages 8-14 of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough no reporting units failed the annual impairment test noted above, in management's opinion, the goodwill of the Display and Packaging reporting unit is at risk of impairment in the near term if operating performance does not improve in line with management's expectations, or if there is a negative change in the long-term outlook for the business or in other factors such as the discount rate. The Display and Packaging reporting unit designs, manufactures, assembles, packs and distributes temporary, semi-permanent and permanent point-of-purchase displays; provides supply chain management services, including contract packing, fulfillment and scalable service centers; and manufactures retail packaging, including printed backer cards, thermoformed blisters and heat sealing equipment. The current goodwill\nimpairment analysis incorporates management's expectations for moderate sales growth and mild improvements to profit margin percentages which reflects the estimated benefits of future productivity initiatives. A large portion of expected sales in this reporting unit is concentrated in several major customers and if the business with any of these customers is lost or significantly declines, or other projected synergies and productivity gains are not realized, a goodwill impairment charge could be incurred. Total goodwill associated with this reporting unit was approximately $203 million at December 31, 2018. Based on the latest annual impairment test, the estimated fair value of the Display and Packaging reporting unit is approximately equal to its carrying value.\nIn its 2018 annual goodwill impairment analysis, projected future cash flows for Display and Packaging were discounted at 10.2%. Based on the discounted cash flow model and holding other valuation assumptions constant, if Display and Packaging projected operating profits across all future periods are reduced approximately 10%, or the discount rate is increased by one hundred basis points, the Company estimates a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately $25 million would be incurred.\nDuring the time subsequent to the annual evaluation, and at December 31, 2018, the Company considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstances had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting units may have been impaired. It is management's opinion that no such events have occurred.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>31\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome taxes\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets generally represent expenses that have been recognized for financial reporting purposes, but for which the corresponding tax deductions will occur in future periods. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not standard, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Associated interest has also been recognized, where applicable.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company received a draft Notice of Proposed Adjustment ( NOPA\u201d) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in February 2017 proposing an adjustment to income for the 2013 tax year based on the IRS's recharacterization of a distribution of an intercompany note made in 2012, and the subsequent repayment of the note over the course of 2013, as if it were a cash distribution made in 2013. In March 2017, the Company received a draft NOPA proposing penalties of $18 million associated with the IRS's recharacterization, as well as an Information Document Request ( IDR\u201d) requesting the Company's analysis of why such penalties should not apply. The Company responded to this IDR in April 2017. On October 5, 2017, the Company received two revised draft NOPAs proposing the same adjustments and penalties as in the prior NOPAs. On November 14, 2017, the Company received two final NOPAs proposing the same adjustments and penalties as in the prior NOPAs. On November 20, 2017, the Company received a Revenue Agents Report ( RAR\u201d) that included the same adjustments and penalties as in the prior NOPAs. At the time of the distribution in 2012, it was characterized as a dividend to the extent of earnings and profits, with the remainder as a tax free return of basis and taxable capital gain. As the IRS proposes to recharacterize the distribution, the entire distribution would be characterized as a dividend. The incremental tax liability associated with the income adjustment proposed in the RAR would be approximately $89 million, excluding interest and the previously referenced penalties. On January 22, 2018, the Company filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS. The Company received a rebuttal of its protest from the IRS on July 10, 2018, and the matter has now been referred to the Appeals Division of the IRS. The Company strongly believes the position of the IRS with regard to this matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing Treasury regulations, and that the Company's previously reported income tax provision for the year in question is appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in the Company's favor. Regardless of whether the matter is resolved in the Company's favor, the final resolution of this matter could be expensive and time consuming to defend and/or settle. While the Company believes that the amount of tax originally paid with respect to this distribution is correct, and accordingly has not provided additional reserve for tax uncertainty, there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. The Company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which earnings or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates. As a result, the eventual resolution of these matters could have a different impact on the effective rate than currently reflected or expected.\nStock-based compensation plans\nThe Company utilizes share-based compensation in the form of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and other share-based awards. Certain awards are in the form of contingent stock units where the ultimate number of units are performance based. The amount of share-based compensation expense associated with these performance-based awards are based on estimates regarding future performance using measures defined in the plans. In 2018, the performance measures consisted of Earnings per Share and Return on Net Assets Employed. Changes in estimates regarding the future achievement of these performance measures may result in significant fluctuations from period to period in the amount of share-based compensation expense reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company uses an option-pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of its stock appreciation rights. Inputs to the model include a number of subjective assumptions. Management routinely assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share-based compensation per share. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time that results in changes to these assumptions and methodologies, which could materially impact fair value determinations.\nPension and postretirement benefit plans\nThe Company has significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations employ key assumptions that can have a significant effect on the calculated amounts. The key assumptions used at December 31, 2018, in determining the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation for U.S. retirement and retiree health and life insurance plans include: discount rates of 4.34% and 4.14% for the active and inactive qualified retirement plans, respectively, 4.16% for the non-qualified retirement plans, and 4.02% for the retiree health and life insurance plan. The rate of compensation increase for the retiree health and life insurance plan was 3.06%. The key assumptions used to determine 2018 net periodic benefit cost for U.S. retirement and retiree health and life insurance plans include: discount rates of 3.69% and 3.49% for the active and inactive qualified retirement plans, respectively, 3.50% for the non-qualified retirement plans, and 3.36% for the retiree health and life insurance plan; an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% and 6.75% for the active and inactive qualified retirement plans, respectively; and rates of compensation increases ranging from 3.28% to 4.02%.\nDuring 2018, the Company recorded total pension and postretirement benefit expenses of approximately $34.9 million, compared with $78.5 million during 2017. The 2018 amount reflects $92.2 million of expected returns on plan assets at an average assumed rate of 6.38% and interest cost of $55.4 million at a weighted-average discount rate of 3.43%. The 2017 amount reflects $82.8 million of expected returns on plan assets at an average assumed rate of 6.3% and interest cost of $56.3 million at a weighted-average discount rate of 3.34%. The expense recognized in 2017 also includes $32.8 million of pension settlement charges, which are discussed in more detail below. During 2018, the Company made contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of $25.4 million. In the prior year, the Company made contributions to its pension and postretirement plans totaling $108.6 million, including a voluntary $50 million contribution to its U.S. active qualified retirement plan. Contributions vary from year to year depending on various factors, the most significant being the market value of assets and interest rates. Cumulative net actuarial losses were approximately $639 million at December 31, 2018, and are primarily the result of low discount rates. Actuarial losses/gains outside of the 10% corridor defined by U.S. GAAP are amortized over the average remaining service life of the plan's active participants or the average remaining life expectancy of the plan's inactive participants if all, or almost all, of the plan's participants are inactive.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>32\n</td> <td>FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn February 2017, the Company initiated a program to settle a portion of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) relating to terminated vested participants in the U.S. qualified retirement plans through either a single, lump-sum payment or the purchase of an annuity. The terminated vested population comprised approximately 15% of the beginning of year PBO of these plans. The Company successfully settled approximately 47% of the PBO for the terminated vested plan participants. As a result of these and other smaller settlements, the Company recognized non-cash settlement charges of $32.8 million in 2017. All settlement payments were funded from plan assets and did not require the Company to make any additional cash contributions in 2017. The Company recognized settlement charges of $0.7 million in 2018 primarily resulting from payments made to certain participants of the Company's Canadian pension plan who elected a lump sum distribution upon retirement. The Company does not expect to recognize any additional settlement charges in 2019.\nThe Company projects total benefit plan expense to be approximately $16 million higher in 2019 than in 2018. The increase is primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets due to a lower asset base resulting from the weak market performance in 2018 and a 25 basis point reduction in the Company's expected long-term rate of return assumption. Partially offsetting this unfavorable impact, is the impact of higher discount rates on year-over-year benefit plan expense.\nPlan benefits under the U.S. qualified retirement plan were frozen effective December 31, 2018 for all active, non-union participants. As of January 1, 2019, these participants became eligible for annual contributions under a noncontributory defined contribution program called the \"Sonoco Retirement Contribution.\"\nThe Company adjusts its discount rates at the end of each fiscal year based on yield curves of high-quality debt instruments over durations that match the expected benefit payouts of each plan. The expected rate of return assumption is derived by taking into consideration the targeted plan asset allocation, projected future returns by asset class and active investment management. A third-party asset return model was used to develop an expected range of returns on plan investments over a 12- to 15-year period, with the expected rate of return selected from a best estimate range within the total range of projected results. The Company periodically re-balances its plan asset portfolio in order to maintain the targeted allocation levels. The rate of compensation increase assumption is generally based on salary and incentive compensation increases. A key assumption for the U.S. retiree health and life insurance plan is a medical cost trend rate beginning at 6.5% for post-age 65 participants and trending down to an ultimate rate of 4.5% in 2026. The ultimate trend rate of 4.5% represents the Company's best estimate of the long-term average annual medical cost increase over the duration of the plan's liabilities. It provides for real growth in medical costs in excess of the overall inflation level.\nOther assumptions and estimates impacting the projected liabilities of these plans include inflation, participant withdrawal and mortality rates and retirement ages. The Company annually reevaluates assumptions used in projecting the pension and postretirement liabilities and associated expense. These judgments, assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of pension and postretirement plan net assets and liabilities and pension and postretirement plan expenses in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe sensitivity to changes in the critical assumptions for the Company's U.S. plans as of December 31, 2018, is as follows:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumption\n($ in millions)\n</td> <td>Percentage\nPoint\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Projected Benefit\nObligation\nHigher/(Lower)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Annual\nExpense\nHigher/\n(Lower)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>-.25 pts </td> <td> </td> <td>$39.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.4 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected return on assets </td> <td>-.25 pts </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>$2.8 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's pension and postretirement plans.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is provided in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "This report provides an overview of Sonoco's financial condition and operations.

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nGeneral overview\nSonoco is a leading manufacturer of consumer, industrial and protective packaging products and provider of packaging services with 312 locations in 36 countries. The Company's operations are reported in four segments, Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.\nGenerally, the Company serves two broad end-use markets, consumer and industrial, which, period to period, can exhibit different economic characteristics from each other. Geographically, approximately 65% of sales were generated in the United States, 20% in Europe, 5% in Asia, 5% in Canada and 5% in other regions.\nThe Company is a market-share leader in many of its product lines, particularly in tubes, cores and composite containers. Competition in most of the Company's businesses is intense. Demand for the Company's products and services is primarily driven by the overall level of consumer consumption of non-durable goods; however, certain product and service groups are tied more directly to durable goods, such as appliances, automobiles and construction. The businesses that supply and/or service consumer product companies have tended to be, on a relative basis, more recession resistant than those that service industrial markets.\nFinancially, the Company's objective is to deliver average annual double-digit total returns to shareholders over time. To meet that target, the Company focuses on three major areas: driving profitable sales growth, improving margins and leveraging the Company's strong cash flow and financial position. Operationally, the Company's goal is to be the acknowledged leader in high-quality, innovative, value-creating packaging solutions within targeted customer market segments.\nOver the next two to three years, the Company aspires to achieve operating profit before depreciation and amortization (OPBDA) margins of 16% per year and annual sales of approximately $6 billion. (See \"Use of Non-GAAP financial measures\" below). The Company believes it will achieve these goals by focusing on the following: organic sales growth, including new product development and expansion in emerging international markets; strategic portfolio optimization; and margin enhancement through more effective customer relationship management, organizational design, indirect spend management, and improved manufacturing productivity, supply chain and back office support processes.\nUse of Non-GAAP financial measures\nTo assess and communicate the financial performance of the Company, Sonoco management uses, both internally and externally, certain financial performance measures that are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP\u201d financial measures). These non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Company's GAAP operating results adjusted to remove amounts, including the associated tax effects, relating to restructuring initiatives, asset impairment charges, environmental charges, acquisition-related costs, gains or losses from the disposition of businesses, excess property insurance recoveries, pension settlement charges, certain income tax events and other items, if any, including other income tax-related adjustments and/or events, the exclusion of which management believes improves the period-to-period comparability and analysis of the underlying financial performance of the business. The adjusted non-GAAP results are identified using the term base,\u201d for example, base earnings.\u201d\nThe Company's base financial performance measures are not in accordance with, nor an alternative for, measures conforming to generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Sonoco continues to provide all information required by GAAP, but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor or other user is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. The Company uses the non-GAAP base\u201d performance measures presented herein for internal planning and forecasting purposes, to evaluate its ongoing operations, and to evaluate the ultimate performance of management and each business unit against plan/forecast all the way up through the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's performance by the Board of Directors. In addition, these same non-GAAP measures are used in determining incentive compensation for the entire management team and in providing earnings guidance to the investing community.\nSonoco management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Sonoco presents these non-GAAP financial measures to provide users information to evaluate Sonoco's operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance. Material limitations associated with the use of such measures are that they do not reflect all period costs included in operating expenses and may not reflect financial results that are comparable to financial results of other companies that present similar costs differently. Furthermore, the calculations of these non-GAAP measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that the investor may find material and view differently. To compensate for these limitations, management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of the business to review both GAAP information which includes all of the items impacting financial results and the non-GAAP measures that exclude certain elements, as described above.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges are a recurring item as Sonoco's restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. Although recurring, these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. Similarly, non-operating pension expense is a recurring item. However, this expense is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, global financial markets (including stock market returns and interest rate changes), plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances.\nReconciliations of GAAP to base results are presented on pages 21 and 22 in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations. Whenever reviewing a non-GAAP financial measure, readers are encouraged to review the related reconciliation to fully understand how it differs from the related GAAP measure. Reconciliations are not provided for non-GAAP measures related to future years due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which management is unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the tax effect of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\n2018 overview and 2019 outlook\nThe Company produced strong top-line, bottom-line and cash flow results in 2018 despite low growth rates in many of the Company's served markets, accelerating inflation, tariffs and disappointing performances in our plastics and flexible packaging businesses. Year-over-year growth in consolidated operating profit of 6.1% was largely driven by a $49.5 million, or 30.7%, increase in the operating profit of Paper and Industrial Converted Products and was also aided by a strong turnaround in our Display and Packaging segment. These gains were partially offset by a $31.3 million, or 12.2%, decline in operating profits for our Consumer Packaging segment. Operating profit for our Protective Solutions segment was relatively flat year over year. On a company-wide basis, gains from a positive overall price/cost relationship (the relationship of the change in\n 18 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT \nsales prices to the change in costs of materials, energy and freight) and the added operating profit from acquisitions were only partially offset by higher labor, maintenance and other operating costs. As a result, consolidated gross profit margin for 2018 improved modestly to 19.3% compared to 19.0% in 2017.\nNet Income Attributable to Sonoco (GAAP earnings) for 2018 increased $138.2 million, or 78.8%, year over year. This increase is largely due to prior-year pension settlement charges totaling $20.2 million, after-tax, a prior-year $51.3 million net tax charge related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"), and a 2018 valuation allowance release triggered by certain provisions of the Tax Act. The remainder is largely due to higher 2018 operating income together with the lower US statutory tax rate established by the Tax Act. Base earnings, which exclude the previously mentioned prior-year charges, the valuation allowance release, as well as certain other items of income and expense, as more fully described within this Item under \"Use of Non-GAAP financial measures\" and reconciled within this Item under \"Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures,\" improved $58.8 million, or 20.9%, year over year.\nManagement's focus in 2018 was on driving synergies with acquired businesses, accelerating organic growth, improving manufacturing productivity, using the Company's strong financial position to make strategic acquisitions and improving operating efficiency and financial performance of the Company's contract packaging services center near Atlanta, Georgia. Management expected overall volume in 2018 to increase approximately 2%, overall price/cost to be positive and that manufacturing productivity would more than offset increases in labor and other costs. Actual 2018 volume increased slightly more than one percent as gains in Display and Packaging were partially offset by declines in Consumer Products and Paper and Industrial Converted Products. The 2018 performance of businesses acquired in 2017 fell short of expectations due to a combination of volume shortfalls, production inefficiencies and negative price / cost. The volume shortfalls and production inefficiencies in these businesses were significant drivers leading to an overall flat year for manufacturing productivity. However, price/cost was positive in almost all of the Company's other businesses, and was extremely positive in the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment and the Company as a whole. Despite continued improvements at its Atlanta-area packaging center, the Company determined that it could not achieve acceptable margins under the associated single-customer contract and negotiated an early termination of that contract and exited the facility late in the third quarter of 2018. In October, the Company acquired both the remaining 70 percent interest in its Conitex-Sonoco tube and core/paper joint venture and a composite can operation from Texpack, Inc. This transaction brings the joint venture operations under the sole control of the Company and expands its exposure to the Asia paper and industrial products market. In April, the Company acquired Highland Packaging Solutions, a manufacturer of thermoformed plastic packaging for fresh produce and dairy products. Highland expands the Company's footprint in its targeted \"perimeter of the store\" market. These transactions are described in greater detail below.\nPension and postretirement benefit expenses for the year were approximately $44 million lower in 2018 than 2017, due primarily to settlement charges related to lump sum payments and purchases of annuities for certain plan participants in 2017. Excluding these charges, total benefit plan expense was approximately $12 million lower in 2018 than in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to higher expected returns on plan assets due to a higher asset base as of December 31, 2017. Total net contributions in 2018 to the Company's domestic and international pension and postretirement plans were approximately $25 million. The aggregate net unfunded position of the Company's various defined benefit plans increased from $332 million at the end of 2017, to $369 million at the end of 2018. This increase was driven by normal service and interest cost and a negative actual return on plan assets during 2018, partially offset by the impact of contributions and slightly higher discount rates on plan liabilities at December 31, 2018.\nThe effective tax rate on GAAP earnings was 19.8%, compared with 46.6% in 2017, and the effective tax rate on base earnings was 23.7%, compared with 31.1% in 2017. The year-over-year decrease in both GAAP and base effective tax rates was driven primarily by the Tax Act, including the decrease in the U.S. Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The year-over-year variance in the GAAP tax rate is also driven by Tax Act changes, including the 2018 benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits of $16.1 million and the exceptionally high 2017 rate, which included approximately $51.2 million of one-time tax charges related to the Tax Act.\nThe Company generated $589.9 million in cash from operations during 2018, compared with $348.3 million in 2017. The majority of the year-over-year increase is attributable to higher net income, lower pension and post-retirement contributions and a beneficial difference in the changes in working capital, partially offset by an unfavorable difference in the change in income tax accruals. Cash flow from operations is expected to be approximately $600 million in 2019.\nOutlook\nIn 2019, management's focus will be on generating profitable growth, improving margins, driving free cash flow, and portfolio optimization, including the potential for both targeted acquisitions and divestitures, which, in turn, are expected to impact margins and prospects for profitable growth. Key to management's objectives for the year will be further development of the Company's previously implemented commercial and operational excellence initiatives aimed at improving margins by more-fully realizing the value of our products and services, reducing our unit costs and better leveraging our fixed support costs.\nManagement is targeting an overall organic volume increase in 2019 of approximately 1.0%. Although the Company has projected that overall price/cost will be positive in 2019, duplicating the degree of price/cost improvement seen in 2018 is considered unlikely. Continued volatility in key raw material prices would make full recovery of any related cost increases more challenging. And, although manufacturing productivity is expected to offset a significant portion of the projected increases in labor and other costs, not realizing the targeted organic volume gains would make fully achieving management's productivity objectives more difficult. Operating results in 2019 will include a full year of revenue and operating profit from Highland and Conitex.\nThe Company projects the non-operating component of pension and post-retirement benefits expense to be approximately $19 million higher, while the operating component is projected to be $3 million lower. The net anticipated increase of $16 million is primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets due to a lower asset base and a 25 basis point decrease in the 2019 expected rate of return assumption. Total contributions in 2019 to the Company's domestic and international pension and postretirement plans are expected to be approximately $31.0 million.\nIn consideration of the above factors, management is projecting that reported net sales will increase nearly 5% and overall margins for gross profit, base operating profit and base operating profit before depreciation and amortization will improve modestly over 2018 levels.\nAbsent additional borrowings in 2019 from any acquisition activity, net interest expense is expected to decrease approximately $3 million due to lower average annual debt balances as the Company would expect to use a portion of its free cash flow to pay down existing debt. The consolidated effective tax rate on base earnings is expected to be between 25.5% and 26.5% in 2019 compared with 23.7% in 2018. The anticipated year-over-year increase is due to discrete items that benefited the 2018 rate that are not expected to recur in 2019.\nThe Company does not provide projected GAAP earnings results due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the income tax effects of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\n 19 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT \nAcquisitions and dispositions\nAcquisitions\nThe Company completed three acquisitions during 2018 at a cost of $278.8 million, net of cash acquired. On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 70 percent interest in Conitex Sonoco (BVI), Ltd. (\"Conitex Sonoco\") from Texpack Investments, Inc. (\"Texpack\") for total consideration of $134.8 million, including net cash payments of $127.8 million and debt assumed of $7.1 million. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing. This adjustment was settled in February 2019 and required an additional cash payment of approximately $0.1 million. The Conitex Sonoco joint venture was formed in 1998 with Texpack, a Spanish-based global provider of paperboard and paper-based packaging products. Conitex Sonoco produces uncoated recycled paperboard and tubes and cones for the global spun yarn industry, as well as adhesives, flexible intermediate bulk containers and corrugated pallets. Conitex Sonoco has approximately 1,250 employees across 13 manufacturing locations in 10 countries, including four paper mills and seven cone and tube converting operations and two other production facilities. The acquisition of Conitex Sonoco is expected to add approximately $260 million of annual sales in the Company's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment. Also on October 1, 2018, the Company acquired from Texpack Group Holdings B.V. a rigid paper facility in Spain (\"Compositub\") for $10.0 million in cash. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing. This adjustment was settled in February 2019 for an additional cash payment to the seller of $0.4 million. Both the Conitex Sonoco and Compositub acquisitions were funded with existing cash on hand. On April 12, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Highland Packaging Solutions (\"Highland\"). Total consideration for this acquisition was $148.5 million, including net cash paid at closing of $141.0, along with a contingent purchase liability of $7.5 million. The contingent purchase liability is based upon a sales metric which the Company expects to meet and is payable in two installments. The first installment of $5.0 million is to be paid one year after the closing date and the second installment of $2.5 million is to be paid two years after the closing date. The liability for these two payments has been recognized in full on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018, with the first installment included in \"Accrued expenses and other\" and the second in \"Other Liabilities.\" Highland manufactures thermoformed plastic packaging for fresh produce and dairy products from a single production facility in Plant City, Florida, providing total packaging solutions for customers that include sophisticated engineered containers, flexographic printed labels, and inventory management through distribution warehouses in the Southeast and West Coast of the United States. The Company financed the acquisition with proceeds from a new $100.0 million term loan, along with proceeds from existing credit facilities. This loan was repaid in full before the end of 2018. The acquisition of Highland is expected to add approximately $110 million of annual sales in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment.\nThe Company completed two acquisitions during 2017 at a cost of $383.7 million, net of cash acquired. On March 14, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Packaging Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries, including Peninsula Packaging LLC (\"Packaging Holdings\"), for $218.8 million, net of cash acquired. Packaging Holdings manufactures thermoformed packaging for a wide range of whole fresh fruits, pre-cut fruits and produce, prepared salad mixes, as well as baked goods in retail supermarkets from five manufacturing facilities, including four in the United States and one in Mexico. The Company financed the transaction with a combination of cash and borrowings, including a $150.0 million three-year term loan. On July 24, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Clear Lam Packaging, Inc. (\"Clear Lam\") for $165.0 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to an adjustment for working capital, which was completed in 2018 resulting in $1.6 million of cash being returned to the Company. Clear Lam manufactures high barrier flexible and forming films used to package a variety of products for consumer packaged goods companies, retailers and other industrial manufacturers, with a focus on structures used for perishable foods. It has production facilities in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, and Nanjing, China. The Company financed a portion of the transaction with $100 million in borrowings from a $250 million five-year term loan with the remaining purchase price funded from available short-term credit facilities.\nThe Company completed four acquisitions during 2016 at a cost of $88.6 million, net of cash acquired. On June 24, 2016, the Company completed an acquisition in its Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment of a small tube and core business in Australia for $0.9 million in cash. On August 30, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition in its Protective Solutions segment of the temperature-controlled cargo container assets, licenses, trademarks, and manufacturing rights from AAR Corporation. Total consideration for this business was $6.0 million consisting of a current cash payment of $3.0 million, non-contingent deferred cash consideration of $2.0 million, and contingent consideration valued at $1.0 million. Also in the Protective Solutions segment, Laminar Medica (\"Laminar\"), a privately held specialty medical products company based in the U.K., was acquired on September 19, 2016 for $17.2 million, net of cash acquired. On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition in its Consumer Packaging segment of Plastic Packaging Inc. (\"PPI\"), a privately held Hickory, NC-based flexible packaging company for $67.6 million, net of cash acquired. Founded in 1957, PPI specializes in short-run, customized flexible packaging for consumer brands in markets including: food products (i.e. frozen foods, baked goods, seafood), pet products (i.e. dry food, bird seed, litter), confection (i.e. seasonal promotions, heat-sealed chocolate packaging, hard and soft candy), and health and personal care (i.e. nutraceuticals, diapers, tissues/wipes).\nDispositions\nOn November 7, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its rigid plastics blow molding operations to Amcor Rigid Plastics USA, LLC and Amcor Packaging Canada, Inc. for approximately $280 million, with the Company receiving net cash proceeds of $271.8 million. In conjunction with the sale, the Company recognized a gain on the disposition, net of associated fees, of $104.3 million. The Company's rigid plastics blow molding operations included seven manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Canada with approximately 850 employees producing containers serving the personal care and food and beverage markets. The disposition of these operations negatively impacted 2017 over 2016 sales comparisons by approximately $175 million. The decision to sell the blow molding operations was made to focus on, and provide resources to further enhance, the Company's targeted growth businesses, including flexible packaging, thermoformed rigid plastics, and temperature-assurance packaging. This sale did not notably affect operating margin percentages for the Company's Consumer Packaging segment, nor did it represent a strategic shift for the Company having a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about acquisition and disposition activities.\nRestructuring and asset impairment charges\nDue to its geographic footprint (312 locations in 36 countries) and the cost-competitive nature of its businesses, the Company is constantly seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve its customers and to respond to fundamental changes in its markets. As such, restructuring costs have been and are expected to be a recurring component of the Company's operating costs. The amount of these costs can vary significantly from year to year depending upon the scope and location of the restructuring activities.\n 20 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT \nThe following table recaps the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges on the Company's net income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\nDuring 2018, the Company announced the closure of a flexible packaging plant in North Carolina, a global brand management facility in Canada, a thermoformed packaging plant in California (all part of the Consumer Packaging segment), five tube and core plants - one in Alabama, one in Canada, one in Indonesia, one in Russia, and one in Norway (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment), and a protective packaging plant in North Carolina (part of the Protective Solutions segment). Restructuring actions in the Display and Packaging segment included charges associated with exiting a single-customer contract at a packaging center near Atlanta, Georgia. In addition the Company continued to realign its cost structure, resulting in the elimination of approximately 120 positions.\nDuring 2017, the Company announced the closure of an expanded foam protective packaging plant in the United States (part of the Protective Solutions segment), five tubes and cores plants - three in the United States, one in Belgium, and one in China (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment), and a packaging services center in Mexico (part of the Display and Packaging segment). Asset impairment charges recorded in 2017 included a $17.8 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 recognized as a result of the Company's decision to shut down its #9 boiler in the Hartsville, South Carolina manufacturing complex. In addition, the Company recognized severance charges throughout 2017 related to the elimination of approximately 185 positions in conjunction with the Company's ongoing organizational effectiveness efforts.\nDuring 2016, the Company announced the closure of four tubes and cores plants - one in the United States, one in Canada, one in Ecuador, and one in Switzerland (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment). The Company closed a packaging services center in Mexico and a fulfillment service center in Brazil (both part of the Display and Packaging segment). The Company also began manufacturing rationalization efforts in its Reels division (part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment), and completed the sales of a paper mill in France (part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment) and a retail security packaging plant in Puerto Rico (part of the Display and Packaging segment). In addition, the Company continued to realign its cost structure, resulting in the elimination of approximately 180 positions.\nThe Company expects to recognize future additional costs totaling approximately $1.8 million in connection with previously announced restructuring actions. The Company believes that the majority of these charges will be incurred and paid by the end of 2019. The Company regularly evaluates its cost structure, including its manufacturing capacity, and additional restructuring actions are likely to be undertaken. Restructuring and asset impairment charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the Company operates.\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about restructuring activities and asset impairment charges.\nReconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures\nThe following tables reconcile the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for each of the years presented:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nGeneral overview\nSonoco is a leading manufacturer of consumer, industrial and protective packaging products and provider of packaging services with 312 locations in 36 countries. The Company's operations are reported in four segments, Consumer Packaging, Display and Packaging, Paper and Industrial Converted Products, and Protective Solutions.\nGenerally, the Company serves two broad end-use markets, consumer and industrial, which, period to period, can exhibit different economic characteristics from each other. Geographically, approximately 65% of sales were generated in the United States, 20% in Europe, 5% in Asia, 5% in Canada and 5% in other regions.\nThe Company is a market-share leader in many of its product lines, particularly in tubes, cores and composite containers. Competition in most of the Company's businesses is intense. Demand for the Company's products and services is primarily driven by the overall level of consumer consumption of non-durable goods; however, certain product and service groups are tied more directly to durable goods, such as appliances, automobiles and construction. The businesses that supply and/or service consumer product companies have tended to be, on a relative basis, more recession resistant than those that service industrial markets.\nFinancially, the Company's objective is to deliver average annual double-digit total returns to shareholders over time. To meet that target, the Company focuses on three major areas: driving profitable sales growth, improving margins and leveraging the Company's strong cash flow and financial position. Operationally, the Company's goal is to be the acknowledged leader in high-quality, innovative, value-creating packaging solutions within targeted customer market segments.\nOver the next two to three years, the Company aspires to achieve operating profit before depreciation and amortization (OPBDA) margins of 16% per year and annual sales of approximately $6 billion. (See \"Use of Non-GAAP financial measures\" below). The Company believes it will achieve these goals by focusing on the following: organic sales growth, including new product development and expansion in emerging international markets; strategic portfolio optimization; and margin enhancement through more effective customer relationship management, organizational design, indirect spend management, and improved manufacturing productivity, supply chain and back office support processes.\nUse of Non-GAAP financial measures\nTo assess and communicate the financial performance of the Company, Sonoco management uses, both internally and externally, certain financial performance measures that are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP\u201d financial measures). These non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Company's GAAP operating results adjusted to remove amounts, including the associated tax effects, relating to restructuring initiatives, asset impairment charges, environmental charges, acquisition-related costs, gains or losses from the disposition of businesses, excess property insurance recoveries, pension settlement charges, certain income tax events and other items, if any, including other income tax-related adjustments and/or events, the exclusion of which management believes improves the period-to-period comparability and analysis of the underlying financial performance of the business. The adjusted non-GAAP results are identified using the term base,\u201d for example, base earnings.\u201d\nThe Company's base financial performance measures are not in accordance with, nor an alternative for, measures conforming to generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Sonoco continues to provide all information required by GAAP, but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor or other user is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. The Company uses the non-GAAP base\u201d performance measures presented herein for internal planning and forecasting purposes, to evaluate its ongoing operations, and to evaluate the ultimate performance of management and each business unit against plan/forecast all the way up through the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's performance by the Board of Directors. In addition, these same non-GAAP measures are used in determining incentive compensation for the entire management team and in providing earnings guidance to the investing community.\nSonoco management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Sonoco presents these non-GAAP financial measures to provide users information to evaluate Sonoco's operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance. Material limitations associated with the use of such measures are that they do not reflect all period costs included in operating expenses and may not reflect financial results that are comparable to financial results of other companies that present similar costs differently. Furthermore, the calculations of these non-GAAP measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that the investor may find material and view differently. To compensate for these limitations, management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of the business to review both GAAP information which includes all of the items impacting financial results and the non-GAAP measures that exclude certain elements, as described above.\nRestructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges are a recurring item as Sonoco's restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. Although recurring, these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. Similarly, non-operating pension expense is a recurring item. However, this expense is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, global financial markets (including stock market returns and interest rate changes), plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances.\nReconciliations of GAAP to base results are presented on pages 21 and 22 in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations. Whenever reviewing a non-GAAP financial measure, readers are encouraged to review the related reconciliation to fully understand how it differs from the related GAAP measure. Reconciliations are not provided for non-GAAP measures related to future years due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which management is unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the tax effect of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\n2018 overview and 2019 outlook\nThe Company produced strong top-line, bottom-line and cash flow results in 2018 despite low growth rates in many of the Company's served markets, accelerating inflation, tariffs and disappointing performances in our plastics and flexible packaging businesses. Year-over-year growth in consolidated operating profit of 6.1% was largely driven by a $49.5 million, or 30.7%, increase in the operating profit of Paper and Industrial Converted Products and was also aided by a strong turnaround in our Display and Packaging segment. These gains were partially offset by a $31.3 million, or 12.2%, decline in operating profits for our Consumer Packaging segment. Operating profit for our Protective Solutions segment was relatively flat year over year. On a company-wide basis, gains from a positive overall price/cost relationship (the relationship of the change in\n 18 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT \nsales prices to the change in costs of materials, energy and freight) and the added operating profit from acquisitions were only partially offset by higher labor, maintenance and other operating costs. As a result, consolidated gross profit margin for 2018 improved modestly to 19.3% compared to 19.0% in 2017.\nNet Income Attributable to Sonoco (GAAP earnings) for 2018 increased $138.2 million, or 78.8%, year over year. This increase is largely due to prior-year pension settlement charges totaling $20.2 million, after-tax, a prior-year $51.3 million net tax charge related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"), and a 2018 valuation allowance release triggered by certain provisions of the Tax Act. The remainder is largely due to higher 2018 operating income together with the lower US statutory tax rate established by the Tax Act. Base earnings, which exclude the previously mentioned prior-year charges, the valuation allowance release, as well as certain other items of income and expense, as more fully described within this Item under \"Use of Non-GAAP financial measures\" and reconciled within this Item under \"Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures,\" improved $58.8 million, or 20.9%, year over year.\nManagement's focus in 2018 was on driving synergies with acquired businesses, accelerating organic growth, improving manufacturing productivity, using the Company's strong financial position to make strategic acquisitions and improving operating efficiency and financial performance of the Company's contract packaging services center near Atlanta, Georgia. Management expected overall volume in 2018 to increase approximately 2%, overall price/cost to be positive and that manufacturing productivity would more than offset increases in labor and other costs. Actual 2018 volume increased slightly more than one percent as gains in Display and Packaging were partially offset by declines in Consumer Products and Paper and Industrial Converted Products. The 2018 performance of businesses acquired in 2017 fell short of expectations due to a combination of volume shortfalls, production inefficiencies and negative price / cost. The volume shortfalls and production inefficiencies in these businesses were significant drivers leading to an overall flat year for manufacturing productivity. However, price/cost was positive in almost all of the Company's other businesses, and was extremely positive in the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment and the Company as a whole. Despite continued improvements at its Atlanta-area packaging center, the Company determined that it could not achieve acceptable margins under the associated single-customer contract and negotiated an early termination of that contract and exited the facility late in the third quarter of 2018. In October, the Company acquired both the remaining 70 percent interest in its Conitex-Sonoco tube and core/paper joint venture and a composite can operation from Texpack, Inc. This transaction brings the joint venture operations under the sole control of the Company and expands its exposure to the Asia paper and industrial products market. In April, the Company acquired Highland Packaging Solutions, a manufacturer of thermoformed plastic packaging for fresh produce and dairy products. Highland expands the Company's footprint in its targeted \"perimeter of the store\" market. These transactions are described in greater detail below.\nPension and postretirement benefit expenses for the year were approximately $44 million lower in 2018 than 2017, due primarily to settlement charges related to lump sum payments and purchases of annuities for certain plan participants in 2017. Excluding these charges, total benefit plan expense was approximately $12 million lower in 2018 than in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to higher expected returns on plan assets due to a higher asset base as of December 31, 2017. Total net contributions in 2018 to the Company's domestic and international pension and postretirement plans were approximately $25 million. The aggregate net unfunded position of the Company's various defined benefit plans increased from $332 million at the end of 2017, to $369 million at the end of 2018. This increase was driven by normal service and interest cost and a negative actual return on plan assets during 2018, partially offset by the impact of contributions and slightly higher discount rates on plan liabilities at December 31, 2018.\nThe effective tax rate on GAAP earnings was 19.8%, compared with 46.6% in 2017, and the effective tax rate on base earnings was 23.7%, compared with 31.1% in 2017. The year-over-year decrease in both GAAP and base effective tax rates was driven primarily by the Tax Act, including the decrease in the U.S. Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The year-over-year variance in the GAAP tax rate is also driven by Tax Act changes, including the 2018 benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits of $16.1 million and the exceptionally high 2017 rate, which included approximately $51.2 million of one-time tax charges related to the Tax Act.\nThe Company generated $589.9 million in cash from operations during 2018, compared with $348.3 million in 2017. The majority of the year-over-year increase is attributable to higher net income, lower pension and post-retirement contributions and a beneficial difference in the changes in working capital, partially offset by an unfavorable difference in the change in income tax accruals. Cash flow from operations is expected to be approximately $600 million in 2019.\nOutlook\nIn 2019, management's focus will be on generating profitable growth, improving margins, driving free cash flow, and portfolio optimization, including the potential for both targeted acquisitions and divestitures, which, in turn, are expected to impact margins and prospects for profitable growth. Key to management's objectives for the year will be further development of the Company's previously implemented commercial and operational excellence initiatives aimed at improving margins by more-fully realizing the value of our products and services, reducing our unit costs and better leveraging our fixed support costs.\nManagement is targeting an overall organic volume increase in 2019 of approximately 1.0%. Although the Company has projected that overall price/cost will be positive in 2019, duplicating the degree of price/cost improvement seen in 2018 is considered unlikely. Continued volatility in key raw material prices would make full recovery of any related cost increases more challenging. And, although manufacturing productivity is expected to offset a significant portion of the projected increases in labor and other costs, not realizing the targeted organic volume gains would make fully achieving management's productivity objectives more difficult. Operating results in 2019 will include a full year of revenue and operating profit from Highland and Conitex.\nThe Company projects the non-operating component of pension and post-retirement benefits expense to be approximately $19 million higher, while the operating component is projected to be $3 million lower. The net anticipated increase of $16 million is primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets due to a lower asset base and a 25 basis point decrease in the 2019 expected rate of return assumption. Total contributions in 2019 to the Company's domestic and international pension and postretirement plans are expected to be approximately $31.0 million.\nIn consideration of the above factors, management is projecting that reported net sales will increase nearly 5% and overall margins for gross profit, base operating profit and base operating profit before depreciation and amortization will improve modestly over 2018 levels.\nAbsent additional borrowings in 2019 from any acquisition activity, net interest expense is expected to decrease approximately $3 million due to lower average annual debt balances as the Company would expect to use a portion of its free cash flow to pay down existing debt. The consolidated effective tax rate on base earnings is expected to be between 25.5% and 26.5% in 2019 compared with 23.7% in 2018. The anticipated year-over-year increase is due to discrete items that benefited the 2018 rate that are not expected to recur in 2019.\nThe Company does not provide projected GAAP earnings results due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast: possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs and restructuring-related impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, and the income tax effects of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items could have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP financial results.\n 19 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT \nAcquisitions and dispositions\nAcquisitions\nThe Company completed three acquisitions during 2018 at a cost of $278.8 million, net of cash acquired. On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 70 percent interest in Conitex Sonoco (BVI), Ltd. (\"Conitex Sonoco\") from Texpack Investments, Inc. (\"Texpack\") for total consideration of $134.8 million, including net cash payments of $127.8 million and debt assumed of $7.1 million. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing. This adjustment was settled in February 2019 and required an additional cash payment of approximately $0.1 million. The Conitex Sonoco joint venture was formed in 1998 with Texpack, a Spanish-based global provider of paperboard and paper-based packaging products. Conitex Sonoco produces uncoated recycled paperboard and tubes and cones for the global spun yarn industry, as well as adhesives, flexible intermediate bulk containers and corrugated pallets. Conitex Sonoco has approximately 1,250 employees across 13 manufacturing locations in 10 countries, including four paper mills and seven cone and tube converting operations and two other production facilities. The acquisition of Conitex Sonoco is expected to add approximately $260 million of annual sales in the Company's Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment. Also on October 1, 2018, the Company acquired from Texpack Group Holdings B.V. a rigid paper facility in Spain (\"Compositub\") for $10.0 million in cash. Final consideration was subject to a post-closing adjustment for the change in working capital to the date of closing. This adjustment was settled in February 2019 for an additional cash payment to the seller of $0.4 million. Both the Conitex Sonoco and Compositub acquisitions were funded with existing cash on hand. On April 12, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Highland Packaging Solutions (\"Highland\"). Total consideration for this acquisition was $148.5 million, including net cash paid at closing of $141.0, along with a contingent purchase liability of $7.5 million. The contingent purchase liability is based upon a sales metric which the Company expects to meet and is payable in two installments. The first installment of $5.0 million is to be paid one year after the closing date and the second installment of $2.5 million is to be paid two years after the closing date. The liability for these two payments has been recognized in full on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018, with the first installment included in \"Accrued expenses and other\" and the second in \"Other Liabilities.\" Highland manufactures thermoformed plastic packaging for fresh produce and dairy products from a single production facility in Plant City, Florida, providing total packaging solutions for customers that include sophisticated engineered containers, flexographic printed labels, and inventory management through distribution warehouses in the Southeast and West Coast of the United States. The Company financed the acquisition with proceeds from a new $100.0 million term loan, along with proceeds from existing credit facilities. This loan was repaid in full before the end of 2018. The acquisition of Highland is expected to add approximately $110 million of annual sales in the Company's Consumer Packaging segment.\nThe Company completed two acquisitions during 2017 at a cost of $383.7 million, net of cash acquired. On March 14, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Packaging Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries, including Peninsula Packaging LLC (\"Packaging Holdings\"), for $218.8 million, net of cash acquired. Packaging Holdings manufactures thermoformed packaging for a wide range of whole fresh fruits, pre-cut fruits and produce, prepared salad mixes, as well as baked goods in retail supermarkets from five manufacturing facilities, including four in the United States and one in Mexico. The Company financed the transaction with a combination of cash and borrowings, including a $150.0 million three-year term loan. On July 24, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Clear Lam Packaging, Inc. (\"Clear Lam\") for $165.0 million, net of cash acquired. Final consideration was subject to an adjustment for working capital, which was completed in 2018 resulting in $1.6 million of cash being returned to the Company. Clear Lam manufactures high barrier flexible and forming films used to package a variety of products for consumer packaged goods companies, retailers and other industrial manufacturers, with a focus on structures used for perishable foods. It has production facilities in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, and Nanjing, China. The Company financed a portion of the transaction with $100 million in borrowings from a $250 million five-year term loan with the remaining purchase price funded from available short-term credit facilities.\nThe Company completed four acquisitions during 2016 at a cost of $88.6 million, net of cash acquired. On June 24, 2016, the Company completed an acquisition in its Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment of a small tube and core business in Australia for $0.9 million in cash. On August 30, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition in its Protective Solutions segment of the temperature-controlled cargo container assets, licenses, trademarks, and manufacturing rights from AAR Corporation. Total consideration for this business was $6.0 million consisting of a current cash payment of $3.0 million, non-contingent deferred cash consideration of $2.0 million, and contingent consideration valued at $1.0 million. Also in the Protective Solutions segment, Laminar Medica (\"Laminar\"), a privately held specialty medical products company based in the U.K., was acquired on September 19, 2016 for $17.2 million, net of cash acquired. On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition in its Consumer Packaging segment of Plastic Packaging Inc. (\"PPI\"), a privately held Hickory, NC-based flexible packaging company for $67.6 million, net of cash acquired. Founded in 1957, PPI specializes in short-run, customized flexible packaging for consumer brands in markets including: food products (i.e. frozen foods, baked goods, seafood), pet products (i.e. dry food, bird seed, litter), confection (i.e. seasonal promotions, heat-sealed chocolate packaging, hard and soft candy), and health and personal care (i.e. nutraceuticals, diapers, tissues/wipes).\nDispositions\nOn November 7, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its rigid plastics blow molding operations to Amcor Rigid Plastics USA, LLC and Amcor Packaging Canada, Inc. for approximately $280 million, with the Company receiving net cash proceeds of $271.8 million. In conjunction with the sale, the Company recognized a gain on the disposition, net of associated fees, of $104.3 million. The Company's rigid plastics blow molding operations included seven manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Canada with approximately 850 employees producing containers serving the personal care and food and beverage markets. The disposition of these operations negatively impacted 2017 over 2016 sales comparisons by approximately $175 million. The decision to sell the blow molding operations was made to focus on, and provide resources to further enhance, the Company's targeted growth businesses, including flexible packaging, thermoformed rigid plastics, and temperature-assurance packaging. This sale did not notably affect operating margin percentages for the Company's Consumer Packaging segment, nor did it represent a strategic shift for the Company having a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about acquisition and disposition activities.\nRestructuring and asset impairment charges\nDue to its geographic footprint (312 locations in 36 countries) and the cost-competitive nature of its businesses, the Company is constantly seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve its customers and to respond to fundamental changes in its markets. As such, restructuring costs have been and are expected to be a recurring component of the Company's operating costs. The amount of these costs can vary significantly from year to year depending upon the scope and location of the restructuring activities.\n 20 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2018 ANNUAL REPORT \nThe following table recaps the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges on the Company's net income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exit costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Actions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,638 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017 Actions </td> <td>7,176 </td> <td> </td> <td>14,646 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016 and Earlier Actions </td> <td>(92) </td> <td> </td> <td>3,756 </td> <td> </td> <td>35,761 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments: </td> <td>5,349 </td> <td> </td> <td>20,017 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,122 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restructuring/asset impairment charges </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,071 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,419 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,883 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(10,038) </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,064) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,520) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of noncontrolling interests, net of tax\n</td> <td>(191) </td> <td> </td> <td>(71) </td> <td> </td> <td>(161) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total impact of restructuring/asset impairment charges, net of tax </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,842 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,284 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,202 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, the Company announced the closure of a flexible packaging plant in North Carolina, a global brand management facility in Canada, a thermoformed packaging plant in California (all part of the Consumer Packaging segment), five tube and core plants - one in Alabama, one in Canada, one in Indonesia, one in Russia, and one in Norway (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment), and a protective packaging plant in North Carolina (part of the Protective Solutions segment). Restructuring actions in the Display and Packaging segment included charges associated with exiting a single-customer contract at a packaging center near Atlanta, Georgia. In addition the Company continued to realign its cost structure, resulting in the elimination of approximately 120 positions.\nDuring 2017, the Company announced the closure of an expanded foam protective packaging plant in the United States (part of the Protective Solutions segment), five tubes and cores plants - three in the United States, one in Belgium, and one in China (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment), and a packaging services center in Mexico (part of the Display and Packaging segment). Asset impairment charges recorded in 2017 included a $17.8 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 recognized as a result of the Company's decision to shut down its #9 boiler in the Hartsville, South Carolina manufacturing complex. In addition, the Company recognized severance charges throughout 2017 related to the elimination of approximately 185 positions in conjunction with the Company's ongoing organizational effectiveness efforts.\nDuring 2016, the Company announced the closure of four tubes and cores plants - one in the United States, one in Canada, one in Ecuador, and one in Switzerland (all part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment). The Company closed a packaging services center in Mexico and a fulfillment service center in Brazil (both part of the Display and Packaging segment). The Company also began manufacturing rationalization efforts in its Reels division (part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment), and completed the sales of a paper mill in France (part of the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment) and a retail security packaging plant in Puerto Rico (part of the Display and Packaging segment). In addition, the Company continued to realign its cost structure, resulting in the elimination of approximately 180 positions.\nThe Company expects to recognize future additional costs totaling approximately $1.8 million in connection with previously announced restructuring actions. The Company believes that the majority of these charges will be incurred and paid by the end of 2019. The Company regularly evaluates its cost structure, including its manufacturing capacity, and additional restructuring actions are likely to be undertaken. Restructuring and asset impairment charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the Company operates.\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about restructuring activities and asset impairment charges.\nReconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures\nThe following tables reconcile the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for each of the years presented:\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data </td> <td>GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td>Restructuring/\nAsset\nImpairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Acquisition\nRelated\nCosts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Other Adjustments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Base </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>437,629 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,071 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,446 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(326) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>491,820 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating pension costs </td> <td>941 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(742) </td> <td> </td> <td>199 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>58,157 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>58,157 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>378,531 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,071 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,446 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>416 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>433,464 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td>75,008 </td> <td> </td> <td>10,038 </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> <td>17,539 </td> <td> </td> <td>102,700 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before equity in earnings of affiliates </td> <td>$ </td> <td>303,523 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,033 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,331 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,123) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>330,764 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of affiliates, net of tax </td> <td>11,216 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>11,216 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td>"}
