Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImportant Note about Forward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and notes thereto included in this document and our unaudited 10-Q filings for the first three quarters of 2018 and the notes thereto. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe statements that are not historical constitute \u2018\u2018forward-looking statements.'' Said forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of such terms and phrases as \u2018\u2018expects,'' \u2018\u2018intends,'' \u2018\u2018goals,'' \u2018\u2018estimates,'' \u2018\u2018projects,'' \u2018\u2018plans,'' \u2018\u2018anticipates,'' \u2018\u2018should,'' \u2018\u2018future,'' \u2018\u2018believes,'' and \u2018\u2018scheduled.''\nThe variables, which may cause differences include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions; competition; success of operating initiatives; operating costs; advertising and promotional efforts; the existence or absence of adverse publicity; changes in business strategy or development plans; the ability to retain management; availability, terms and deployment of capital; business abilities and judgment of personnel; availability of qualified personnel; labor and employment benefit costs; availability and costs of raw materials and supplies; and changes in, or failure to comply with various government regulations. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate; therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K will prove to be accurate.\nIn light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any person that the objectives and expectations of the Company will be achieved.\nOverview\nCUI Global, Inc. is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998. The Company's principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300. CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies. Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u2018\u2018GAAP''). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.\nWhile all of our significant accounting policies impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would have caused a material change in our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.\nAsset Impairment\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets including finite-lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected. Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined that certain long-term prepaid assets classified on the balance sheet as deposits and other assets, which were reliant on future revenue in order to be amortized to expense, did not have adequate forecasted revenue to justify the current valuation. This was primarily driven by the lack of substantial sales over the last two years within the Energy segment and uncertainty regarding the level of future sales. For that reason, the Company recorded a $1.5 million impairment to deposits and other assets included in cost of revenues and reclassified $0.1 million to prepaid assets. The amount reclassified to prepaid assets related to prepaid royalties associated with expected 2019 revenue. There were no asset impairments other than to Goodwill in 2017 or 2016.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, \u2018\u2018Business Combinations,'' where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\n2018 Annual Test. The Company tests for impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and Goodwill in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of Goodwill exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. The Company's qualitative assessment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2018, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B.\nUnder current accounting guidance, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The guidance includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment. The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.\nAs detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for Goodwill as of May 31, 2018, management completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including Goodwill. To complete the qualitative review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the Goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of Goodwill.\nDuring our review of Goodwill as of May 31, 2018, the Company determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.\nThe significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the most recent impairment test performed as of December 31, 2017 included a decline in the 2018 actual revenue, operating income and cash flows compared to prior forecasts for the same period and a negative change in the 2018 forecasted revenue, operating income and cash flows for the remainder of the year due in part to the longer than expected temporary halt in shipping of its GasPT product to a major customer in Italy and market uncertainty due to the continuing effects of Brexit.\nTo test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment as of May 31, 2018, the Company used a quantitative test. The Company estimated the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a blend of a market approach and an income approach, which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Orbital-UK reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Orbital-UK reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The Company based its cash flow projections for the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a forecast of cash flows and a terminal value developed by capitalizing an assumed stabilized cash flow figure. The forecast and related assumptions were derived from an updated financial forecast prepared during the second quarter of 2018. At that time, a key assumption related to the recoverability of the Orbital-UK reporting unit Goodwill was the resumption of delivery of GasPT product to one of our major customers and continued strengthening of our integration revenues. Under the market approach, appropriate valuation multiples were derived from the historical operating data of selected guideline companies. The valuation multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Company relative to the selected guideline companies and the multiple was then applied to the appropriate operating data of the Company to arrive at an indication of fair market value. As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in an impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a Goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 million during the second quarter of 2018.\nDecember 2018 Interim Test. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined that there were additional indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. The significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2018 were driven by a slower recovery in the Energy segment than what was originally forecasted. Actual GasPT revenue continued to lag behind forecasted revenue as acceptance of the technology continued to be slower than anticipated and continued delays associated with existing customer contracts that have not yet resumed even though previously communicated issues had been resolved. This slower than expected recovery, led to lower 2018 Energy segment revenue, operating income and cash flows than originally forecasted.\nTo test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment, the Company used a quantitative test similar to the one used in May 2018. The Company estimated the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a blend of a market approach and an income approach, which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Orbital-UK reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Orbital-UK reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The Company based its cash flow projections for the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a revised forecast of cash flows and a terminal value developed by capitalizing an assumed stabilized cash flow figure. The forecast and related assumptions were derived from an updated financial forecast prepared during the fourth quarter of 2018. Under the market approach, appropriate valuation multiples were derived from the historical operating data of selected guideline companies. The valuation multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Company relative to the selected guideline companies and the multiple was then applied to the appropriate operating data of the Company to arrive at an indication of fair market value. As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in further impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2018, which was a write-off of the remaining Energy segment goodwill. In addition, the reporting units in the Power and Electromechanical segment were also tested for impairment due to the overall decrease in market capitalization experienced in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there was goodwill and indefinite lived assets remaining for CUI Inc., CUI-Canada and CUI-Japan reporting units, which are included in the Power and Electromechanical segment.\nDecember 2017 Interim Test. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. The significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2017 included a decline in the 2017 actual revenue, operating income and cash flows compared to previously forecasted results and a decline in the 2018 forecasted revenue, operating income and cash flows due in part to the longer than expected temporary halt in shipping of its GasPT product to a major customer in Italy and market uncertainty due to the continuing effects of Brexit.\nTo test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment, the Company used a quantitative test.

As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in an impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2016 Annual Test. In 2016, the analysis, determined there was no impairment necessary to goodwill. Through these reviews, management concluded there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with current accounting guidance. In 2016, in addition to the qualitative analysis, we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and concluded no impairment of goodwill was required.\nLong-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets\nBesides goodwill being tested for impairment, the Company also tested its long-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets for Orbital-UK. The result of the quantitative test of undiscounted cash flows, did not result in any impairment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718 (\u2018\u2018FASB ASC 718''), \u2018\u2018Compensation - Stock Compensation.'' FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.\nStock bonuses issued to employees are recorded at fair value using the market price of the stock on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period or immediately if fully vested on date of issuance. Employee stock options are recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The underlying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility, which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website; and (4) other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates. With regards to expected volatility for determining the fair value of our stock options, the Company utilizes an appropriate period for historical share prices for CUI Global, Inc. that best reflects the expected weighted average lifespan of the options.\nValuation of Non-Cash Capital Stock Issuances\nThe Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments. Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of an equity instrument. The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock. Each of these methods may produce a different result. Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction. If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company used the quoted market price of the Company's common stock to estimate the fair value of stock transactions.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and all the related amendments ( new revenue standard\"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. This guidance includes the required steps to achieve the core principle that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue standard was applied using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of this standard, certain changes have been made to the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We expect the ongoing impact of the adoption of the new standard to primarily affect the timing of revenue recognition. The most significant impact was on Power and Electromechanical segment revenue with certain distribution customers that were previously recorded as sell through.\" Under the new accounting guidance, we record the revenue upon sale to the distributor with an appropriate amount reserved for estimated returns and allowances as the Company recognizes revenue at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to its customers. For the Power and Electromechanical segment, their revenue is based upon the transfer of goods and satisfaction of its performance obligations as of a point in time. During the transition this had the effect of having a certain amount of revenue not recorded as revenue but as part of the cumulative effect of the accounting change. For the majority of contracts in the Energy segment, revenue is still measured over time using the cost-to-cost method. The change that most affected the transition adjustment on Energy segment revenue was the requirement to limit revenue recognition on contracts without an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue on contracts without a specific enforceable right to payment on work performed to date was \"clawed back\" as part of the Company's transition adjustment. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded as of January 1, 2018 was a net $1.9 million decrease to accumulated deficit due to a $2.8 million transition adjustment from the Power and Electromechanical segment partially offset by a $(0.9) million transition adjustment from the Energy segment, net of deferred tax.\nPower and Electromechanical Segment\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment generates its revenue from two categories of products: power supply solutions - including external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters, basic digital point of load modules, ICE (Intelligent Control of Energy) products enabled by the VPS patented software system and offering a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories; and components - including connectors, speakers, buzzers, and industrial control solutions including encoders and sensors. These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as telecommunications, consumer electronics, medical and defense, among others. The production and delivery of these products are considered single performance obligations. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation and this occurs upon shipment and ownership transfer of our products to our customers at a point in time.\nEnergy Segment\nThe Energy segment generates their revenue from a portfolio of products, services and resources that offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, petrochemical, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries, among others.\nOrbital accounts for a majority of its contract revenue proportionately over time. For our performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion can be either an input method or an output method and requires judgment based on the nature of the goods or services to be provided.\nFor our construction contracts, revenue is generally recognized over time as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls. Our fixed price construction projects generally use a cost-to-cost input method to measure our progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation as we believe it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.\nThe timing of revenue recognition for Energy products also depends on the payment terms of the contract, as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us. For those contracts which we have a right to payment for performance completed to date at all times throughout our performance, inclusive of a cancellation, we recognize revenue over time. As discussed above, these performance obligations use a cost-to-cost input method to measure our progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation as we believe it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. However, for those contracts for which we do not have a right, at all times, to payment for performance completed to date, we recognize revenue at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.\nFor our services contracts, revenue is also generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of our performance as we perform the service. For our fixed price service contracts with specified service periods, revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over such service period when our inputs are expended evenly, and the customer receives and consumes the benefits of our performance throughout the contract term.\nFor certain of our revenue streams, such as call-out repair and service work, outage services and training that are performed under time and materials contracts, our progress towards complete satisfaction of such performance obligations is measured using an output method as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of our performance completed to date.\nDue to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance obligation will be revised in the near-term. For those performance obligations for which revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method, changes in total estimated costs, and related progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made. When the current estimate of total costs for a performance obligation indicate a loss, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the unsatisfied performance obligation is made in the period in which the loss becomes evident.\nProduct-type contracts (for example, sale of GasPT units) for which revenue does not qualify to be recognized over time are recognized at a point in time. Revenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period.\nAccounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nAccounts receivable are recognized in the period when our right to consideration is unconditional. Accounts receivable are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of realization of receivables.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets include unbilled amounts from our construction projects when revenue recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress exceeds the amounts invoiced to our customers, as the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of our contracts. Such amounts are recoverable from our customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of a contract. Also included in contract assets are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders or modifications in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and/or price or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (claims and unapproved change orders). Our contract assets do not include capitalized costs to obtain and fulfill a contract. Contract assets are generally classified as current within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nContract liabilities from our construction contracts occur when amounts invoiced to our customers exceed revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress. Contract liabilities additionally include advanced payments from our customers on certain contracts. Contract liabilities decrease as we recognize revenue from the satisfaction of the related performance obligation and are recorded as either current or long-term, depending upon when we expect to recognize such revenue.\nRefund Liabilities and Corresponding Inventory Adjustment\nRefund liabilities primarily represent estimated future new product introduction returns and estimated future scrap returns. Estimated future returns and allowances are reserved based on historical return rates. In addition to the refund liabilities recorded for future returns, the Company also records an adjustment to inventory and corresponding adjustment to cost of revenue for the Company's right to recover products from customers upon settling the refund liability.\nPerformance Obligations\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's remaining performance obligations are generally expected to be filled within the next 12 months.\nAny adjustments to net revenues, cost of revenues, and the related impact to operating income are recognized as necessary in the period they become known. These adjustments may result from positive program performance, and may result in an increase in operating income during the performance of individual performance obligations, if we determine we will be successful in mitigating risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of those performance obligations. Likewise, these adjustments may result in a decrease in operating income if we determine we will not be successful in mitigating these risks. Changes in estimates of net revenues, cost of revenues and the related impact to operating income are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage of completion. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. For separately priced extended warranty or product maintenance performance obligations, when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the performance obligation exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation is recognized in the period the loss is determined.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time\nTo determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts for our Energy segment, we evaluate whether a single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to separate the single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period.\nFor most of our contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single project or capability (even if that single project results in the delivery of multiple units). Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. Less commonly, however, we may promise to provide distinct goods or services within a contract in which case we separate the contract into more than one performance obligation. If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. We infrequently sell standard products with observable standalone sales. In cases where we do, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price. More frequently, we sell a customized customer specific solution, and in these cases we typically use the expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time.\nRevenue from goods and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 84% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. The majority of our revenue recognized at a point in time is in our Power and Electromechanical segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the product is shipped and the customer takes ownership of the product. Determination of ownership and control transfer is determined by shipping terms delineated on the customer purchase orders.\nVariable Consideration\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including new product returns and scrap return allowances primarily in our Power and Electromechanical segment. In rare instances in our Energy segment, we include in our contract estimates, additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include new product introduction and scrap return estimates in our calculation of net revenue when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the returns. These estimates are based on historical return experience, anticipated returns and our best judgment at the time. These amounts are included in our calculation of net revenue recorded for our contracts and the associated remaining performance obligations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2018, CUI Global held Cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 million. Operations, other intangible assets, and equipment have been funded through cash on hand and short-term credit facilities during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCash used in Operations\nThere was a use of cash from operations of approximately $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. This was an increase from the use of cash from operations of approximately $9.4 million and approximately $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Overall, the change in cash used in operations is primarily the result of the net loss in 2018 before non-cash expenses affected by changes in assets and liabilities.\nCash used in operations of $12.3 million in 2018 was a $2.9 million increase in cash used compared to the amount used in operations in 2017. The year ended December 31, 2018 benefited from higher revenue and the related gross profit in the Power and Electromechanical segment resulting in cash provided by operating activities from this segment of $4.8 million. In 2018, cash used in operating activities by the Energy segment was approximately $11.1 million and cash used in operating activities by the Other category was approximately $6.0 million.\nDuring 2018, in addition to the Company's net loss after non-cash items, significant factors affecting cash used in operating activities included the change in trade accounts receivable and inventories. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for $3.8 million of cash used in operating activities and was due to higher fourth quarter revenues in both the Power and Electromechanical and Energy segments compared to the revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. Increased cash usage of $2.2 million from change in inventories were due to a build-up of Power and Electromechanical inventories due to longer lead times for these products and timing related to customer order and delivery schedules, partially offset by positive changes to inventories in the Energy segment. Also contributing to the increased cash usage was a decrease in contract liabilities of $2.3 million. The increased cash usage was partially offset by a combined $3.4 million of cash provided by changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and refund liabilities.\nWe believe cash used in operating activities will improve in the Energy segment in 2019, primarily due to the expected continued improvement in revenue from other integration related systems including biomethane to grid solutions. The Power & Electromechanical segment is expected to continue to provide cash from operations and we believe the cash usage rate in the other category will be flat to slightly lower due to cost-cutting initiatives put in place over the past year.\nThe cash from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 was negatively affected by a larger net loss attributable to the Energy segment and the timing of accounts receivable collections and accounts payable payments in both the Energy and Power and Electromechanical Segments.\nDuring 2017, in addition to the change in trade accounts receivable and accounts payable, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included cash used for inventory purchases of approximately $0.4 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects, $0.5 million related to the change in deposits and other assets due to the increase in long-term prepaid royalties at Orbital-UK, $0.4 million use of cash related to changes in accrued expenses primarily due to a change in accrued compensation in the Energy segment and a $0.4 million use of cash from changes in prepaid assets that affected all three segments. Changes in the combined contract assets and contract liabilities were a combined approximate $2.8 million source of cash in the period related to billings on projects in the Energy segment and increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.\nOn a segment basis, in 2017, the Power and Electromechanical segment contributed cash from operations of approximately $3.9 million while the Energy segment used cash of approximately $8.4 million and the Other category used cash of approximately $4.9 million. The Energy segment was hampered by the continued costs of building brand awareness in North America and a regulatory issue in Italy unrelated to the technology that has delayed the next phase of a significant GasPT project.\nThe use of cash from operations in 2016 was benefited by lower trade accounts receivable balances in both segments at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 as a result of improved collections in both segments and the transition of Tectrol customers to CUI-Canada that delayed some payments at the end of 2015. CUI-Canada's and Orbital-UK's cash from operations improved significantly from 2015 while Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. continued to use more cash than it produced due to the cost of establishing the Orbital brand in the U.S.\nDuring 2016, in addition to the change in trade accounts receivable, significant factors that impacted the cash used in operations included cash used for inventory purchases that increased approximately $1.7 million associated with timing of customer orders and ongoing projects, and a use of cash from changes in contract assets of approximately $1.5 million. This was partially offset by cash provided by the change in contract liabilities of $1.4 million related to billings on projects in the Energy segment and increases in deferred revenue from distributor activity within the Power and Electromechanical segment.\nDuring 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company used stock and options as a form of payment to certain vendors, consultants, directors and employees. For years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded a total of $0.2 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively for share-based compensation related to equity given, or to be given, to employees, directors and consultants for services provided and as payment for royalties earned. The decreases in 2018 compared to 2017 and in 2017 compared to 2016 were due to lower stock-based bonuses, lower stock-based services, and lower stock option vesting expense as all remaining unvested stock options fully vested in 2016.\nProceeds from Sale of Building, Capital Expenditures and Investments\nIn December 2018, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of its Tualatin headquarters. The sale for $8.1 million generated net cash proceeds of $4.2 million after transaction related expenses and after paying off the mortgage on the building and related interest rate swap derivative. As part of the ten-year lease the Company signed on the building, the Company invested in a $0.4 million restricted certificate of deposit to serve as security on the lease, which is included in deposits and other assets on the balance sheet.\nDuring the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, CUI Global invested $1.0 million, $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in fixed assets. These investments typically include additions to equipment for engineering and research and development, tooling for manufacturing, furniture, computer equipment for office personnel, facilities improvements and other fixed assets as needed for operations. The Company anticipates further investment in fixed assets during 2019 in support of its on-going business and continued development of product lines and technologies.\nCUI Global invested $0.5 million, $0.6 million, and $0.9 million in other intangible assets during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These investments typically include product certifications, technology rights, capitalized website development, software for engineering and research and development and software upgrades for office personnel. Investments in 2018 and 2017 primarily related to product certifications in the Power and Electromechanical segment and investments in software in the Energy segment. The increased investments in 2016 were due to an increase in product certifications and an ERP software implementation at Orbital-UK that was completed in the early part of 2018. The Company expects its investment in other intangible assets will continue throughout 2019.\nDuring 2018, CUI Global made investments of $0.7 million in convertible notes receivable with Virtual Power Systems ( VPS\u201d) to support the two companies' continued collaboration and development of industry transforming Software Defined Power technologies. The notes accrue interest at 2% per annum and the interest is compounded annually. Unless converted into shares earlier, principal and accrued interest will convert automatically on the maturity date (October 27, 2019) into shares of VPS common stock at the then current fair market value. If VPS receives gross proceeds greater than $3 million prior to the maturity date in a sale or series of sales of equity securities, the principal and unpaid accrued interest of the note will automatically convert into conversion shares at 80% of the price paid per share for equity securities by investors at that time. As the pioneer in virtualizing power, VPS and its Software Defined Power\u00ae (SDP) enables energy to be reallocated on-demand to data center racks, nodes, workloads or circuits using AI and machine learning to predict and respond to changes in power capacity and demand. SDP-enabled power components, including uninterruptible power systems, generators, power distribution units, battery backups, and power supply units, can react quickly and effectively to sudden shifts and surges in power usage patterns. VPS and CUI Global share the vision that the convergence of data center power infrastructure and software will dramatically improve how energy is provisioned, managed and utilized in modern data centers. Together, we've set an aggressive pace for advancing the pace of adoption and availability of Software Defined Power solutions.\nInvestments made by the Company are subject to an investment policy, which limits our risk of loss exposure by setting appropriate credit quality requirements for investments held, limiting maturities to be one year or less, and setting appropriate concentration levels to prevent concentrations. This includes a requirement that no more than 3% of the portfolio, or $500,000, whichever is greater, may be invested in one particular issue. Since the investment in the VPS convertible note, is considered a strategic investment, the board and management reviewed and approved the investment above the board set limit for individual issuers.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company issued payments of $3 thousand, $29 thousand and $41 thousand, respectively, against capital leases of motor vehicles and equipment. The Company paid $3.4 million, $89 thousand and $85 thousand against the mortgage note payable in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the payoff coming in 2018 as part of the sale-leaseback of the Company's headquarters building. In addition, with the payoff of the mortgage on the Company's headquarters building, the Company also closed out its interest rate swap derivative with a payment of $0.2 million. Also in 2018, 2017, and 2016 the Company issued payments of $45 thousand, $61 thousand, and $59 thousand, respectively, toward the contingent liability associated with the Tectrol acquisition.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had a 1.5 million British pound sterling overdraft facility (approximately $1.9 million at December 31, 2018) and a $5.0 million revolving line of credit (LOC). For the year ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, the Company recorded proceeds of $19.5 million and $9.8 million, respectively, from the Company's overdraft facility in the U.K., and $20.0 million and $22.3 million, respectively, from the Company's line of credit. These proceeds were paid back during 2018 and 2017 except for balances of $1.3 million on the overdraft facility and $1.0 million on the line of credit facility at December 31, 2018.\nDuring March 2019, CUI Global received a firm commitment from Bank of America for a new two-year credit facility for CUI Inc. and CUI-Canada, perfected by a first security lien on all assets of CUI Inc. and CUI-Canada. The facility would also include a $3 million sub-limit for use by CUI-Global non-loan party subsidiaries as a reserve under the borrowing base. The credit facility is to provide for working capital and general corporate purposes. The credit facility would provide up to $10,000,000 in a Revolving Line of Credit Facility ( Revolver\u201d), including a sub-limit for letters of credit. Interest will be based upon Daily Floating LIBOR at LIBOR + 2.00%. The Company expects to close on the credit facility in April 2019.\nS-3 registration\nThe Company filed an S-3 registration statement on March 14, 2017 containing a prospectus that was effective March 29, 2017. With this filing, CUI Global may from time to time issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants, up to an aggregate amount of $100 million.\nOn October 23, 2017, the Company closed on an underwritten public offering of 7,392,856 shares at a public offering price of $2.80 per share, including 964,285 shares sold at the public offering price pursuant to the underwriter's exercise in full of its option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments. The net proceeds to CUI Global (after deducting underwriting discount and other expenses payable by the Company) were approximately $18.9 million. The Company has used the net proceeds from the offering primarily for general corporate purposes, which includes operating expenses, working capital to improve and promote its commercially available products, advance product candidates, to expand international presence and commercialization, research and development, for general capital expenditures and for satisfaction of debt obligations.\nAs the Company focuses on strategic acquisitions, technology development, product line additions, and increasing Orbital Gas Systems market presence, it will fund these activities together with related sales and marketing efforts for its various product offerings with cash on hand, including proceeds from future issuances of equity through the S-3 registration statement, and available debt.\nCUI Global may raise additional capital needed to fund the further development and marketing of its products as well as payment of its debt obligations.\nSee the section entitled Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities for a complete listing of all unregistered securities transactions.\nFinancing activities - related party activity\nDuring 2018, 2017 and 2016, $0.3 million, $0.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively in interest payments were made in relation to the promissory notes issued to related party, IED, Inc. The promissory note terms include a due date of May 15, 2020 and an interest rate of 5% per annum, with interest payable monthly and the principal due as a balloon payment at maturity.\nPlease see Note 7 Notes Payable and Note 11 Related Party Transactions for further discussion of these transactions.\nRecap of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company continued to use cash in the Energy segment while the CUI-Canada operation was more fully integrated into the Company's Power and Electromechanical segment. As expected in the three years following two major additions, along with an ongoing focus on research and development and growth initiatives, cash usage was greater than what it will be when the businesses are fully mature. The net cash used in operating activities increased to $12.3 million from $9.4 million in 2017 with much of that due to the ongoing efforts to grow the current businesses as well as the effects of the delay in the major GasPT project in Italy and overall economic effects of Brexit and the transition in the UK, which has resulted in considerable delays in economic activities in the UK.\nThe Wells Fargo mortgage promissory note was paid off with cash generated from the sale and leaseback of the Company's headquarters building. See Note 7 Notes Payable for more information on this note.\nThe Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CUI Inc. has a revolving Line of Credit (LOC) with Wells Fargo Bank in the principal amount of $5.0 million line of credit, until June 1, 2019. On October 5, 2016, Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. signed a five-year agreement with the London branch of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. for a multi-currency variable rate overdraft facility with a facility limit of 1.5 million pounds sterling ($1.9 million at December 31, 2018) that expires on October 5, 2021. See Note 8 Working Capital Line of Credit and Overdraft Facility for more information on these two credit facilities.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents balances of $4.0 million. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents balances at domestic financial institutions, which were covered under the FDIC insured deposits programs and $68 thousand and $0.2 million, respectively, at foreign financial institutions covered under the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation (FSC) and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC). At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company held $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in Japanese foreign bank accounts, $1 thousand and $0.1 million, respectively, in European foreign bank accounts and $67 thousand and $0.1 million, respectively, in Canadian bank accounts.\nThe following tables present our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 to 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 to 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum lease payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,567 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable maturities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,304 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on notes payable (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>365 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,245 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The interest on notes payable includes fixed interest on the related party note payable to IED, Inc. For further information regarding notes payable see Note 7 Notes Payable.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $124.0 million.\nThe Company expects the revenues from its Power and Electromechanical and Energy Segments, cash on hand, and cash available from debt facilities, including the credit facility with Bank of America discussed above, to cover operating and other expenses for the next twelve months of operations. However, in the short-term, the Company expects its Orbital operations in Houston and the U.K. to continue to need cash support as the businesses increase their market positions and revenue. In the first 2 1/2 months of 2019, the Company supported the Energy segment businesses with $2.2 million in supplemental cash. Management expects the cash support for the Energy segment businesses to decline significantly from the second quarter onward. The CUI-Canada operation in the Power and Electromechanical segment will also continue to be near break even in the short-term. If revenues and other funds are not sufficient to cover all operating and other expenses, additional funding may be required. There is no assurance the Company will be able to raise such additional capital. The failure to raise capital or generate product sales in the expected time frame would have a material adverse effect on the Company. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Company Conditions, for additional discussion of the Company's financial condition and current liquidity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial information regarding revenue

customers. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were greater than in 2017 due to higher revenues in our Power and Electromechanical segment associated with the timing of customer project delivery schedules due to higher sales through our distribution customers and the revenue recognition accounting change while sales to direct customers were relatively flat. Higher revenue in the Energy segment in 2018 is associated with a strong fourth quarter for revenues due to the timing of customer project delivery schedules and despite the continued delay in shipment of GasPTs toward a significant project in Italy. Energy segment revenue was higher in both our UK and Houston facilities.\nThe customer orders related to the Power and Electromechanical segment are associated with the existing product offering, continued new product introductions, continued sales and marketing programs, new customer engagements, and distribution channel sales.\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $21.8 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $20.2 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the Energy segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $15.7 million compared to approximately $12.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nCUI Inc. introduced 1,268 new products during the year ended 2018 compared to 1,122 new products during the year ended 2017. The continued product expansion including ICE products, and our distribution sales channels are expected to continue to result in revenue growth in future periods as CUI's sales group and support staff continues to reach new customers, further expand relationships with existing customers and continued new product introductions in efforts to have CUI products designed into new projects.\n2017 compared to 2016\nRevenues in 2017 were attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, the CUI-Canada related product line, and the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were lower than in 2016 due to lower revenues in our Energy segment associated with the timing of customer project delivery schedules and a regulatory issue in Italy unrelated to the technology that delayed the next phase of that project as well as lower translated revenue at our UK operations due to the lower value British pound Sterling following Brexit. The value of the British pound Sterling began a slow recovery after bottoming out in the first quarter of 2017 and was no longer a negative factor in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to 2016. Partially offsetting the decrease in the Energy segment, was an increase in revenue in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the timing of customer delivery schedules and sell through activity at distributors under the revenue recognition standard in place at the time.\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $20.2 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to a backlog of customer orders of approximately $18.1 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Energy segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $12.6 million compared to approximately $12.1 million at December 31, 2016.\nCUI Inc. introduced 1,122 new products during the year ended 2017 compared to 968 new products during the year ended 2016.\nCost of Revenues\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of Revenues by Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power and Electromechanical\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,059 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.0 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,141 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased to 70% during the year ended December 31, 2018 from 67% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was due largely to an increase to inventory reserves of $1.4 million related to a write-down of inventory and a $1.5 million write down of long-term deposits and other assets that were prepaid within the Energy segment. Also contributing to the higher percentage was a less favorable revenue mix of integration projects in the Energy segment in 2018 offset by a slightly more favorable product mix in the Power and Electromechanical segment on greater volume. As a result of the impairments taken and the less favorable revenue mix in the Energy segment, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in the Energy segment increased 18 percentage points from 69% to 87%. The percentage of cost of revenues for the Power and Electromechanical segment decreased half a percentage point despite a significant royalty expense paid related to the revenues of the ICE switch recognized in the first quarter of 2018. The royalty rate is higher on the first $1.4 million of ICE product revenues. While the cost of revenues decreased as a percentage of sales, the total cost of revenues in the Power and Electromechanical segment increased due to higher sales volume in 2018 compared to 2017. The Company expects improved cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in 2019 as a result of increased sales of higher margin products and better mix of integration and service projects.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased to 67% during the year ended December 31, 2017 from 63% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was due to a less favorable product mix particularly in the Energy segment in 2017 including a decreased volume of higher margin GasPT sales. The Power and Electromechanical segment also had a slight decrease in its gross margin associated with product mix. As a result of the less favorable product mix in the Energy segment, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased 11 percentage points from 58% to 69%. Cost of revenues in the Energy segment were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower sales volumes. The percentage of cost of revenues for the Power and Electromechanical segment increased from 65% to 66%. In addition to the increased cost of revenues percentage, costs of revenues in the Power and Electromechanical segment increased due to higher sales volume in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, General, and Administrative Expense by Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power and Electromechanical\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.0 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,756 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,006 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,942 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.2 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,477 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total SG&A\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,239 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses includes such items as wages, commissions, consulting, general office expenses, business promotion expenses and costs of being a public company including legal and accounting fees, insurance and investor relations.

The increase for the year is due to increased costs in both the Power and Electromechanical and Energy segments primarily due to higher selling expenses on the higher sales within both segments, higher professional fees in the Energy segment and higher SG&A expenses at the new Houston facility. Also contributing to the higher SG&A expenses in the Energy segment in 2018 were increased marketing expenses related to the World Gas Conference. SG&A decreased to 38% of total revenue in 2018 compared to 41% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to economies of scale on 16% higher consolidated revenues.\n2017 compared to 2016\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A decreased $0.3 million compared to the prior-year comparative period. The decrease for the year is largely due to $0.6 million in severance costs incurred in 2016 in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the transition of the R&D team to CUI-Canada and for various positions within the Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to severance costs in 2017 primarily in the Energy segment that were less than $0.3 million. The increase in the Energy segment is due to the severance costs at Orbital-UK and increased advertising expense in the Energy segment of $0.2 million. The remaining decreases in SG&A during the year ended December 31, 2017 were associated with various cost saving measures begun in the second quarter of 2017 and due to the lower sales volume in 2017 compared to 2016. SG&A increased to 41% of total revenue in 2017 compared to 40% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and Amortization by Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power and Electromechanical\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,445 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.0 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,848 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe depreciation and amortization expenses are associated with depreciating buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment, software and other intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The above table includes $0.9 million, $0.7 million, and $0.5 million of depreciation and amortization, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively that was included in cost of revenues in the Power and Electromechanical segment. The increase in depreciation and amortization included in cost of revenues was due to increased allocation of depreciation and amortization to cost of revenues at CUI Inc. and CUI-Canada.\n2018 compared to 2017\nDepreciation and amortization increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the comparable period in 2017. The decrease in depreciation and amortization at the Power and Electromechanical segment was due to the V-Infinity trademark becoming fully amortized in 2017 partially offset by higher product certification amortization in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease in the Power and Electromechanical segment was more than offset by increased depreciation and amortization in the Energy segment due to generally increased foreign currency translation rates in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased software amortization due to Orbital's new ERP system going into service in 2018.\n2017 compared to 2016\nDepreciation and amortization increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the comparable period in 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization at the Power and Electromechanical segment was due to additional product certification investments in 2017, which was partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization at Orbital-UK due to generally lower foreign currency rates in 2017 compared to 2016.\nResearch and Development\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development by Segment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power and Electromechanical\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,873 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30.2 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are associated with the continued research and development of new and existing technologies including advanced power technologies, ICE, GasPT, VE Technology and other products. Research and development expense was down in the Energy segment and up in the Power and Electromechanical segment for year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and up in both segments in 2017 compared to 2016. Research and development activities were primarily focused on the ICE technology in Power and Electromechanical Segment and GasPT and VE technologies in the Energy segment.\nImpairment Loss\nAs of December 31, 2018, management calculated an excess carrying amount for its Orbital-UK goodwill resulting in the remaining goodwill at Orbital-UK being written off, which was a $3.1 million impairment. As of May 31, 2018, management performed its annual assessment of goodwill impairment which resulted in a $1.3 million impairment. As of December 31, 2017, management calculated an excess carrying amount for its Orbital-UK goodwill resulting in a $3.2 million impairment.

Credits to the provision for bad debt are generated when aged receivables are collected at a higher rate than was previously reserved. This results in the calculated reserve being reduced.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign exchange (loss) gain\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(461 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(768.1 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(116.3 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(423 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash gain and unrealized gain on derivative liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.9 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other (expense) income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(251 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(207.3 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(193.2 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(251 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Income\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company's investment in TPI was exchanged for a note receivable from TPI of $0.4 million, which was the carrying value of the investment, earning interest at 5% per annum, due June 30, 2019. The Company recorded interest income on the note of $17 thousand, $18 thousand and $19 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The interest receivable is settled on a quarterly basis via a non-cash offset against the finders-fee royalties earned by TPI on GasPT sales. Any remaining finders-fee royalties balance is offset against the note receivable quarterly. Management reviewed the note receivable for non-collectability as of December 31, 2018 and concluded that no allowance was necessary. For more information on this investment, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment and Note Receivable, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.''\nInterest Expense\nThe Company incurred $0.5 million, $0.5 million, and $0.5 million of interest expense during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense is for interest on the secured note, secured promissory note, and line of credit and overdraft facility. The Company's secured note was repaid in December 2018 as part of the Company's sale-leaseback transaction.\nProvision (benefit) for taxes\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., various state and foreign jurisdictions. We continue to record a full valuation allowance against the Company's U.S. net deferred tax assets as it is \"not more likely than not,\" that the Company will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period. During 2018, the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against the Company's U.K. net deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not,\u201d that the Company will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management concludes realization of such amounts is \"more likely than not.\" In 2018, a net benefit of $0.2 million, was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulting in an effective tax rate of 1.2% compared to a $1.6 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 and an effective tax rate of 11.3%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the income tax benefit primarily represents benefits from foreign net operating losses partially offset by state minimum taxes and taxes on profitable foreign jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the income tax benefit primarily represents benefits from foreign net operating losses and the $0.9 million benefit resulting from the rate changes passed in the December 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by state minimum taxes and taxes on a profitable foreign jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2018, we have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $67.8 million, $62.8 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, and for which the federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards will expire between 2019 and 2038.\n2017 compared to 2016\nIn 2017, a net benefit of $1.6 million, was recorded to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulting in an effective tax rate of 11.3% compared to a $38 thousand tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 and an effective tax rate of (0.5)%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the income tax benefit primarily represents benefits from foreign net operating losses and the $0.9 million benefit resulting from the rate changes passed in the December 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by state minimum taxes and taxes on a profitable foreign jurisdiction, whereas, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the income tax provision primarily represents state minimum taxes and taxes on a profitable foreign jurisdiction.\nConsolidated Net Loss\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe Company had a net loss of $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a net loss of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in the consolidated net loss for 2018 was primarily the result of higher goodwill impairments, higher inventory reserves and impairment of deposits and other assets.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe Company had a net loss of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the consolidated net loss for 2017 was primarily the result of lower revenues coupled with increased cost of revenues due to a less favorable product mix in 2017 compared to 2016, and an impairment to goodwill of $3.2 million.\nEffect of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe Company believes, that during fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point shift in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nInformation on recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards is included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.''", "summary": "The report discusses CUI Global, Inc.'s Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The Company's principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300. CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies. Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u2018\u2018GAAP''). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.\nWhile all of our significant accounting policies impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would have caused a material change in our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.\nAsset Impairment\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets including finite-lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected. Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined that certain long-term prepaid assets classified on the balance sheet as deposits and other assets, which were reliant on future revenue in order to be amortized to expense, did not have adequate forecasted revenue to justify the current valuation. This was primarily driven by the lack of substantial sales over the last two years within the Energy segment and uncertainty regarding the level of future sales. For that reason, the Company recorded a $1.5 million impairment to deposits and other assets included in cost of revenues and reclassified $0.1 million to prepaid assets. The amount reclassified to prepaid assets related to prepaid royalties associated with expected 2019 revenue. There were no asset impairments other than to Goodwill in 2017 or 2016.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, \u2018\u2018Business Combinations,'' where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\n2018 Annual Test. The Company tests for impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and Goodwill in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of Goodwill exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. The Company's qualitative assessment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2018, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B.\nUnder current accounting guidance, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The guidance includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment. The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.\nAs detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for Goodwill as of May 31, 2018, management completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including Goodwill. To complete the qualitative review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the Goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of Goodwill.\nDuring our review of Goodwill as of May 31, 2018, the Company determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.\nThe significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the most recent impairment test performed as of December 31, 2017 included a decline in the 2018 actual revenue, operating income and cash flows compared to prior forecasts for the same period and a negative change in the 2018 forecasted revenue, operating income and cash flows for the remainder of the year due in part to the longer than expected temporary halt in shipping of its GasPT product to a major customer in Italy and market uncertainty due to the continuing effects of Brexit.\nTo test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment as of May 31, 2018, the Company used a quantitative test. The Company estimated the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a blend of a market approach and an income approach, which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Orbital-UK reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Orbital-UK reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The Company based its cash flow projections for the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a forecast of cash flows and a terminal value developed by capitalizing an assumed stabilized cash flow figure. The forecast and related assumptions were derived from an updated financial forecast prepared during the second quarter of 2018. At that time, a key assumption related to the recoverability of the Orbital-UK reporting unit Goodwill was the resumption of delivery of GasPT product to one of our major customers and continued strengthening of our integration revenues. Under the market approach, appropriate valuation multiples were derived from the historical operating data of selected guideline companies. The valuation multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Company relative to the selected guideline companies and the multiple was then applied to the appropriate operating data of the Company to arrive at an indication of fair market value. As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in an impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a Goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 million during the second quarter of 2018.\nDecember 2018 Interim Test. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined that there were additional indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. The significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2018 were driven by a slower recovery in the Energy segment than what was originally forecasted. Actual GasPT revenue continued to lag behind forecasted revenue as acceptance of the technology continued to be slower than anticipated and continued delays associated with existing customer contracts that have not yet resumed even though previously communicated issues had been resolved. This slower than expected recovery, led to lower 2018 Energy segment revenue, operating income and cash flows than originally forecasted.\nTo test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment, the Company used a quantitative test similar to the one used in May 2018. The Company estimated the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a blend of a market approach and an income approach, which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Orbital-UK reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Orbital-UK reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The Company based its cash flow projections for the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a revised forecast of cash flows and a terminal value developed by capitalizing an assumed stabilized cash flow figure. The forecast and related assumptions were derived from an updated financial forecast prepared during the fourth quarter of 2018. Under the market approach, appropriate valuation multiples were derived from the historical operating data of selected guideline companies. The valuation multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Company relative to the selected guideline companies and the multiple was then applied to the appropriate operating data of the Company to arrive at an indication of fair market value. As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in further impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2018, which was a write-off of the remaining Energy segment goodwill. In addition, the reporting units in the Power and Electromechanical segment were also tested for impairment due to the overall decrease in market capitalization experienced in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there was goodwill and indefinite lived assets remaining for CUI Inc., CUI-Canada and CUI-Japan reporting units, which are included in the Power and Electromechanical segment.\nDecember 2017 Interim Test. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. The significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2017 included a decline in the 2017 actual revenue, operating income and cash flows compared to previously forecasted results and a decline in the 2018 forecasted revenue, operating income and cash flows due in part to the longer than expected temporary halt in shipping of its GasPT product to a major customer in Italy and market uncertainty due to the continuing effects of Brexit.\nTo test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment, the Company used a quantitative test.

As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in an impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2016 Annual Test. In 2016, the analysis, determined there was no impairment necessary to goodwill. Through these reviews, management concluded there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with current accounting guidance. In 2016, in addition to the qualitative analysis, we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and concluded no impairment of goodwill was required.\nLong-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets\nBesides goodwill being tested for impairment, the Company also tested its long-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets for Orbital-UK. The result of the quantitative test of undiscounted cash flows, did not result in any impairment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718 (\u2018\u2018FASB ASC 718''), \u2018\u2018Compensation - Stock Compensation.'' FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.\nStock bonuses issued to employees are recorded at fair value using the market price of the stock on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period or immediately if fully vested on date of issuance. Employee stock options are recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The underlying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility, which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website; and (4) other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates. With regards to expected volatility for determining the fair value of our stock options, the Company utilizes an appropriate period for historical share prices for CUI Global, Inc. that best reflects the expected weighted average lifespan of the options.\nValuation of Non-Cash Capital Stock Issuances\nThe Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments. Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of an equity instrument. The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock. Each of these methods may produce a different result. Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction. If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company used the quoted market price of the Company's common stock to estimate the fair value of stock transactions.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and all the related amendments ( new revenue standard\"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. This guidance includes the required steps to achieve the core principle that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue standard was applied using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of this standard, certain changes have been made to the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We expect the ongoing impact of the adoption of the new standard to primarily affect the timing of revenue recognition. The most significant impact was on Power and Electromechanical segment revenue with certain distribution customers that were previously recorded as sell through.\" Under the new accounting guidance, we record the revenue upon sale to the distributor with an appropriate amount reserved for estimated returns and allowances as the Company recognizes revenue at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to its customers. For the Power and Electromechanical segment, their revenue is based upon the transfer of goods and satisfaction of its performance obligations as of a point in time. During the transition this had the effect of having a certain amount of revenue not recorded as revenue but as part of the cumulative effect of the accounting change. For the majority of contracts in the Energy segment, revenue is still measured over time using the cost-to-cost method. The change that most affected the transition adjustment on Energy segment revenue was the requirement to limit revenue recognition on contracts without an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue on contracts without a specific enforceable right to payment on work performed to date was \"clawed back\" as part of the Company's transition adjustment. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded as of January 1, 2018 was a net $1.9 million decrease to accumulated deficit due to a $2.8 million transition adjustment from the Power and Electromechanical segment partially offset by a $(0.9) million transition adjustment from the Energy segment, net of deferred tax.\nPower and Electromechanical Segment\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment generates its revenue from two categories of products: power supply solutions - including external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters, basic digital point of load modules, ICE (Intelligent Control of Energy) products enabled by the VPS patented software system and offering a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories; and components - including connectors, speakers, buzzers, and industrial control solutions including encoders and sensors. These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as telecommunications, consumer electronics, medical and defense, among others. The production and delivery of these products are considered single performance obligations. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation and this occurs upon shipment and ownership transfer of our products to our customers at a point in time.\nEnergy Segment\nThe Energy segment generates their revenue from a portfolio of products, services and resources that offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, petrochemical, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries, among others.\nOrbital accounts for a majority of its contract revenue proportionately over time. For our performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion can be either an input method or an output method and requires judgment based on the nature of the goods or services to be provided.\nFor our construction contracts, revenue is generally recognized over time as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls. Our fixed price construction projects generally use a cost-to-cost input method to measure our progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation as we believe it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.\nThe timing of revenue recognition for Energy products also depends on the payment terms of the contract, as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us. For those contracts which we have a right to payment for performance completed to date at all times throughout our performance, inclusive of a cancellation, we recognize revenue over time. As discussed above, these performance obligations use a cost-to-cost input method to measure our progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation as we believe it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. However, for those contracts for which we do not have a right, at all times, to payment for performance completed to date, we recognize revenue at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.\nFor our services contracts, revenue is also generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of our performance as we perform the service. For our fixed price service contracts with specified service periods, revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over such service period when our inputs are expended evenly, and the customer receives and consumes the benefits of our performance throughout the contract term.\nFor certain of our revenue streams, such as call-out repair and service work, outage services and training that are performed under time and materials contracts, our progress towards complete satisfaction of such performance obligations is measured using an output method as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of our performance completed to date.\nDue to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance obligation will be revised in the near-term. For those performance obligations for which revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method, changes in total estimated costs, and related progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made. When the current estimate of total costs for a performance obligation indicate a loss, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the unsatisfied performance obligation is made in the period in which the loss becomes evident.\nProduct-type contracts (for example, sale of GasPT units) for which revenue does not qualify to be recognized over time are recognized at a point in time. Revenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period.\nAccounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nAccounts receivable are recognized in the period when our right to consideration is unconditional. Accounts receivable are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of realization of receivables.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets include unbilled amounts from our construction projects when revenue recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress exceeds the amounts invoiced to our customers, as the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of our contracts. Such amounts are recoverable from our customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of a contract. Also included in contract assets are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders or modifications in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and/or price or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (claims and unapproved change orders). Our contract assets do not include capitalized costs to obtain and fulfill a contract. Contract assets are generally classified as current within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nContract liabilities from our construction contracts occur when amounts invoiced to our customers exceed revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress. Contract liabilities additionally include advanced payments from our customers on certain contracts. Contract liabilities decrease as we recognize revenue from the satisfaction of the related performance obligation and are recorded as either current or long-term, depending upon when we expect to recognize such revenue.\nRefund Liabilities and Corresponding Inventory Adjustment\nRefund liabilities primarily represent estimated future new product introduction returns and estimated future scrap returns. Estimated future returns and allowances are reserved based on historical return rates. In addition to the refund liabilities recorded for future returns, the Company also records an adjustment to inventory and corresponding adjustment to cost of revenue for the Company's right to recover products from customers upon settling the refund liability.\nPerformance Obligations\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's remaining performance obligations are generally expected to be filled within the next 12 months.\nAny adjustments to net revenues, cost of revenues, and the related impact to operating income are recognized as necessary in the period they become known. These adjustments may result from positive program performance, and may result in an increase in operating income during the performance of individual performance obligations, if we determine we will be successful in mitigating risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of those performance obligations. Likewise, these adjustments may result in a decrease in operating income if we determine we will not be successful in mitigating these risks. Changes in estimates of net revenues, cost of revenues and the related impact to operating income are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage of completion. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. For separately priced extended warranty or product maintenance performance obligations, when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the performance obligation exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation is recognized in the period the loss is determined.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time\nTo determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts for our Energy segment, we evaluate whether a single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to separate the single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period.\nFor most of our contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single project or capability (even if that single project results in the delivery of multiple units). Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. Less commonly, however, we may promise to provide distinct goods or services within a contract in which case we separate the contract into more than one performance obligation. If a contract is separated into", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nImportant Note about Forward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and notes thereto included in this document and our unaudited 10-Q filings for the first three quarters of 2018 and the notes thereto. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe statements that are not historical constitute \u2018\u2018forward-looking statements.'' Said forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate; therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K will prove to be accurate.\nIn light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any person that the objectives and expectations of the Company will be achieved.\nOverview\nCUI Global, Inc. is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998. The Company's principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300. CUI Global is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies. Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u2018\u2018GAAP''). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.\nWhile all of our significant accounting policies impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would have caused a material change in our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.\nAsset Impairment\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets including finite-lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not recognized. Management estimates the fair value and the estimated future cash flows expected. Any changes in these estimates could impact whether there was impairment and the amount of the impairment.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined that certain long-term prepaid assets classified on the balance sheet as deposits and other assets, which were reliant on future revenue in order to be amortized to expense, did not have adequate forecasted revenue to justify the current valuation. This was primarily driven by the lack of substantial sales over the last two years within the Energy segment and uncertainty regarding the level of future sales. For that reason, the Company recorded a $1.5 million impairment to deposits and other assets included in cost of revenues and reclassified $0.1 million to prepaid assets. The amount reclassified to prepaid assets related to prepaid royalties associated with expected 2019 revenue. There were no asset impairments other than to Goodwill in 2017 or 2016.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangibles and Goodwill Assets\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, \u2018\u2018Business Combinations,'' where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\n2018 Annual Test. The Company tests for impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and Goodwill in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of Goodwill exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. The Company's qualitative assessment for indefinite-lived assets at May 31, 2018, followed the guidance in ASC 350-30-35-18A and 18B.\nUnder current accounting guidance, CUI Global is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The guidance includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment. The Company tests for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.\nAs detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for Goodwill as of May 31, 2018, management completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including Goodwill. To complete the qualitative review, management follows the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair values of the Goodwill and considers all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of Goodwill.\nDuring our review of Goodwill as of May 31, 2018, the Company determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.\nThe significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the most recent impairment test performed as of December 31, 2017 included a decline in the 2018 actual revenue, operating income and cash flows compared to prior forecasts for the same period and a negative change in the 2018 forecasted revenue, operating income and cash flows for the remainder of the year due in part to the longer than expected temporary halt in shipping of its GasPT product to a major customer in Italy and market uncertainty due to the continuing effects of Brexit.\nTo test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment as of May 31, 2018, the Company used a quantitative test. The Company estimated the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a blend of a market approach and an income approach, which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Orbital-UK reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Orbital-UK reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The Company based its cash flow projections for the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a forecast of cash flows and a terminal value developed by capitalizing an assumed stabilized cash flow figure. The forecast and related assumptions were derived from an updated financial forecast prepared during the second quarter of 2018. At that time, a key assumption related to the recoverability of the Orbital-UK reporting unit Goodwill was the resumption of delivery of GasPT product to one of our major customers and continued strengthening of our integration revenues. Under the market approach, appropriate valuation multiples were derived from the historical operating data of selected guideline companies. The valuation multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Company relative to the selected guideline companies and the multiple was then applied to the appropriate operating data of the Company to arrive at an indication of fair market value. As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in an impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a Goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 million during the second quarter of 2018.\nDecember 2018 Interim Test. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company determined that there were additional indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. The significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2018 were driven by a slower recovery in the Energy segment than what was originally forecasted. Actual GasPT revenue continued to lag behind forecasted revenue as acceptance of the technology continued to be slower than anticipated and continued delays associated with existing customer contracts that have not yet resumed even though previously communicated issues had been resolved. This slower than expected recovery, led to lower 2018 Energy segment revenue, operating income and cash flows than originally forecasted.\nTo test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment, the Company used a quantitative test similar to the one used in May 2018. The Company estimated the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a blend of a market approach and an income approach, which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Orbital-UK reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Orbital-UK reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.

The valuation multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Company relative to the selected guideline companies and the multiple was then applied to the appropriate operating data of the Company to arrive at an indication of fair market value. As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in further impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2018, which was a write-off of the remaining Energy segment goodwill. In addition, the reporting units in the Power and Electromechanical segment were also tested for impairment due to the overall decrease in market capitalization experienced in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there was goodwill and indefinite lived assets remaining for CUI Inc., CUI-Canada and CUI-Japan reporting units, which are included in the Power and Electromechanical segment.\nDecember 2017 Interim Test. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. The significant changes for the Orbital-UK reporting unit subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2017 included a decline in the 2017 actual revenue, operating income and cash flows compared to previously forecasted results and a decline in the 2018 forecasted revenue, operating income and cash flows due in part to the longer than expected temporary halt in shipping of its GasPT product to a major customer in Italy and market uncertainty due to the continuing effects of Brexit.\nTo test the Orbital-UK reporting unit for impairment, the Company used a quantitative test. The Company estimated the fair value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a blend of a market approach and an income approach, which was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the income approach, the Company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the Orbital-UK reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of the Orbital-UK reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The Company based its cash flow projections for the Orbital-UK reporting unit using a forecast of cash flows and a terminal value developed by capitalizing an assumed stabilized cash flow figure. The forecast and related assumptions were derived from an updated financial forecast prepared during the fourth quarter of 2017. Under the market approach, appropriate valuation multiples were derived from the historical operating data of selected guideline companies. The valuation multiples were evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Company relative to the selected guideline companies and the multiple was then applied to the appropriate operating data of the Company to arrive at an indication of fair market value. As a result of the analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Orbital-UK reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The quantitative test for the Orbital-UK reporting unit resulted in an impairment for the Orbital-UK reporting unit, and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2016 Annual Test. In 2016, the analysis, determined there was no impairment necessary to goodwill. Through these reviews, management concluded there were no events or circumstances that triggered an impairment (and there was no expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit would be sold or otherwise disposed of in the following year), therefore, no further analysis was necessary to prepare for goodwill impairment beyond the steps in 350-20-35-3C in accordance with current accounting guidance. In 2016, in addition to the qualitative analysis, we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and concluded no impairment of goodwill was required.\nLong-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets\nBesides goodwill being tested for impairment, the Company also tested its long-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets for Orbital-UK. The result of the quantitative test of undiscounted cash flows, did not result in any impairment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718 (\u2018\u2018FASB ASC 718''), \u2018\u2018Compensation - Stock Compensation.'' FASB Codification No. 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period.\nStock bonuses issued to employees are recorded at fair value using the market price of the stock on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period or immediately if fully vested on date of issuance. Employee stock options are recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The underlying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model by the Company are taken from publicly available sources including: (1) volatility, which is calculated using historic stock price information from online finance websites such as Google Finance and Yahoo Finance; (2) the stock price on the date of grant is obtained from online finance websites such as those previously noted; (3) the appropriate discount rates are obtained from the United States Federal Reserve economic research and data website; and (4) other inputs are determined based on previous experience and related estimates. With regards to expected volatility for determining the fair value of our stock options, the Company utilizes an appropriate period for historical share prices for CUI Global, Inc. that best reflects the expected weighted average lifespan of the options.\nValuation of Non-Cash Capital Stock Issuances\nThe Company values its stock transactions based upon the fair value of the equity instruments. Various methods can be used to determine the fair value of an equity instrument. The Company may use the fair value of the consideration received, the quoted market price of the stock or a contemporaneous cash sale of the common or preferred stock. Each of these methods may produce a different result. Management uses the method it determines most appropriately reflects the stock transaction. If a different method was used it could impact the expense and equity stock accounts. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company used the quoted market price of the Company's common stock to estimate the fair value of stock transactions.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and all the related amendments ( new revenue standard\"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. This guidance includes the required steps to achieve the core principle that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue standard was applied using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of this standard, certain changes have been made to the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We expect the ongoing impact of the adoption of the new standard to primarily affect the timing of revenue recognition. The most significant impact was on Power and Electromechanical segment revenue with certain distribution customers that were previously recorded as sell through.\" Under the new accounting guidance, we record the revenue upon sale to the distributor with an appropriate amount reserved for estimated returns and allowances as the Company recognizes revenue at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to its customers. For the Power and Electromechanical segment, their revenue is based upon the transfer of goods and satisfaction of its performance obligations as of a point in time. During the transition this had the effect of having a certain amount of revenue not recorded as revenue but as part of the cumulative effect of the accounting change. For the majority of contracts in the Energy segment, revenue is still measured over time using the cost-to-cost method. The change that most affected the transition adjustment on Energy segment revenue was the requirement to limit revenue recognition on contracts without an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue on contracts without a specific enforceable right to payment on work performed to date was \"clawed back\" as part of the Company's transition adjustment. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded as of January 1, 2018 was a net $1.9 million decrease to accumulated deficit due to a $2.8 million transition adjustment from the Power and Electromechanical segment partially offset by a $(0.9) million transition adjustment from the Energy segment, net of deferred tax.\nPower and Electromechanical Segment\nThe Power and Electromechanical segment generates its revenue from two categories of products: power supply solutions - including external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters, basic digital point of load modules, ICE (Intelligent Control of Energy) products enabled by the VPS patented software system and offering a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories; and components - including connectors, speakers, buzzers, and industrial control solutions including encoders and sensors. These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as telecommunications, consumer electronics, medical and defense, among others. The production and delivery of these products are considered single performance obligations. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation and this occurs upon shipment and ownership transfer of our products to our customers at a point in time.\nEnergy Segment\nThe Energy segment generates their revenue from a portfolio of products, services and resources that offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, petrochemical, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries, among others.\nOrbital accounts for a majority of its contract revenue proportionately over time. For our performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion can be either an input method or an output method and requires judgment based on the nature of the goods or services to be provided.\nFor our construction contracts, revenue is generally recognized over time as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls. Our fixed price construction projects generally use a cost-to-cost input method to measure our progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation as we believe it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.\nThe timing of revenue recognition for Energy products also depends on the payment terms of the contract, as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us. For those contracts which we have a right to payment for performance completed to date at all times throughout our performance, inclusive of a cancellation, we recognize revenue over time. As discussed above, these performance obligations use a cost-to-cost input method to measure our progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation as we believe it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. However, for those contracts for which we do not have a right, at all times, to payment for performance completed to date, we recognize revenue at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.\nFor our services contracts, revenue is also generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of our performance as we perform the service. For our fixed price service contracts with specified service periods, revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over such service period when our inputs are expended evenly, and the customer receives and consumes the benefits of our performance throughout the contract term.\nFor certain of our revenue streams, such as call-out repair and service work, outage services and training that are performed under time and materials contracts, our progress towards complete satisfaction of such performance obligations is measured using an output method as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of our performance completed to date.\nDue to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance obligation will be revised in the near-term. For those performance obligations for which revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method, changes in total estimated costs, and related progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made. When the current estimate of total costs for a performance obligation indicate a loss, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the unsatisfied performance obligation is made in the period in which the loss becomes evident.\nProduct-type contracts (for example, sale of GasPT units) for which revenue does not qualify to be recognized over time are recognized at a point in time. Revenues from warranty and maintenance activities are recognized ratably over the term of the warranty and maintenance period.\nAccounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nAccounts receivable are recognized in the period when our right to consideration is unconditional. Accounts receivable are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of realization of receivables.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets include unbilled amounts from our construction projects when revenue recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress exceeds the amounts invoiced to our customers, as the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of our contracts. Such amounts are recoverable from our customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of a contract. Also included in contract assets are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders or modifications in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and/or price or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (claims and unapproved change orders). Our contract assets do not include capitalized costs to obtain and fulfill a contract. Contract assets are generally classified as current within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nContract liabilities from our construction contracts occur when amounts invoiced to our customers exceed revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress. Contract liabilities additionally include advanced payments from our customers on certain contracts. Contract liabilities decrease as we recognize revenue from the satisfaction of the related performance obligation and are recorded as either current or long-term, depending upon when we expect to recognize such revenue.\nRefund Liabilities and Corresponding Inventory Adjustment\nRefund liabilities primarily represent estimated future new product introduction returns and estimated future scrap returns. Estimated future returns and allowances are reserved based on historical return rates. In addition to the refund liabilities recorded for future returns, the Company also records an adjustment to inventory and corresponding adjustment to cost of revenue for the Company's right to recover products from customers upon settling the refund liability.\nPerformance Obligations\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's remaining performance obligations are generally expected to be filled within the next 12 months.\nAny adjustments to net revenues, cost of revenues, and the related impact to operating income are recognized as necessary in the period they become known. These adjustments may result from positive program performance, and may result in an increase in operating income during the performance of individual performance obligations, if we determine we will be successful in mitigating risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of those performance obligations. Likewise, these adjustments may result in a decrease in operating income if we determine we will not be successful in mitigating these risks. Changes in estimates of net revenues, cost of revenues and the related impact to operating income are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage of completion. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. For separately priced extended warranty or product maintenance performance obligations, when estimates of total costs to be incurred on the performance obligation exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation is recognized in the period the loss is determined.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time\nTo determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts for our Energy segment, we evaluate whether a single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to separate the single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period.\nFor most of our contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single project or capability (even if that single project results in the delivery of multiple units). Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. Less commonly, however, we may promise to provide distinct goods or services within a contract in which case we separate the contract into more than one performance obligation. If a contract is separated into"}
