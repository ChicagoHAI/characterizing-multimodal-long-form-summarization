MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nLegg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise \"Legg Mason\") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company-sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the U.S. and the U.K. and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. All references to fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014, refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" and \"Company\" refer to Legg Mason.\nOur operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks or hurdle rates. The largest portion of our performance fees is earned based on 12-month performance periods that end in differing quarters during the year, with a portion based on quarterly performance periods. Distribution and service fees are received for distributing investment products and services, for providing other support services to investment portfolios, or for providing non-discretionary advisory services, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management (\"AUM\") and assets under advisement (\"AUA\") and fee rates, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain AUM and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our AUM varies in large part from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets as well as market performance and changes in foreign exchange rates. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance (both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products) of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential client's situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions.\nThe fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of AUM, the asset management affiliate that provides the services, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income or liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues and average operating revenue yields will be affected by the composition of our AUM, with changes in the relative level of equity assets and alternatives typically more significantly impacting our revenues and average operating revenue yields. Average operating revenue yields are calculated as the ratio of annualized investment advisory fees, distribution and service fees, and other revenues, less performance fees, to average AUM. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. We have revenue sharing arrangements in place for most of our asset management affiliates, under which specified percentages of the affiliates' revenues are required to be distributed to us and the balance of the revenues is retained by the affiliates to pay their operating expenses, including compensation expenses, but excluding certain expenses and income taxes. Under these arrangements, our asset management affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs. As such, our Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates and products generate our AUM, and a change in AUM at one affiliate or with respect to one product or class of products can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another affiliate or in another product or class of products. In addition, from time to time, we may agree to changes in revenue sharing and other arrangements with our asset management personnel, which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability.\nThe most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels, non-compensation related operating expense levels at revenue share-based affiliates, and our overall profitability. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing expense, which consists primarily of fees paid to third-party distributors for selling\nour asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are typically consistent from period to period, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity.\nOur financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of global financial markets. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our AUM, and the volatility and general level of securities prices, and interest rates, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, among other things. Periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to have an adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attraction and retention of key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in the attraction and retention of clients. In the last few years, the industry has seen flows into products for which we do not currently garner significant market share. For a further discussion of factors that may affect our results of operations, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors included herein.\nThe financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, commercial banks, insurance companies and other financial services companies. The industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty, the constant introduction of new products and services, and the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been and will continue to be impacted by regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes and keeping abreast of regulatory developments, has required, and will continue to require, us to incur costs that impact our profitability.\nOur strategic priorities are focused on four primary areas listed below. Management keeps these strategic priorities in mind when it evaluates our operating performance and financial condition. Consistent with this approach, we have also presented in the table below the most important initiatives on which management currently focuses in evaluating our performance and financial condition.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Strategic Priorities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Initiatives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Create an innovative portfolio of investment products and promote revenue growth by developing new products and leveraging the capabilities of our affiliates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Identify and execute strategic acquisitions to increase product offerings, strengthen our affiliates, and fill gaps in products and services\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Performance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Deliver compelling and consistent performance against both relevant benchmarks and the products and services of our competitors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Evaluate and reallocate resources within and to our distribution platform to continue to maintain and enhance our leading distribution function with the capability to offer solutions to relevant investment challenges and grow market share worldwide\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Productivity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Operate with a high level of effectiveness and improve ongoing efficiency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Manage expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Align economic relationships with affiliate management teams, including retained affiliate management equity and the implementation of affiliate management equity plan agreements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe strategic priorities discussed above are designed to drive improvements in our net flows, earnings, cash flows, AUM and other key metrics, including operating margin. Certain of these key metrics are discussed in our annual results discussion to follow.\nIn connection with these strategic priorities (principally products and productivity):\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On May 2, 2016, we completed the transaction to combine The Permal Group, Limited (\"Permal\"), our existing hedge fund platform, with EnTrust Capital (\"EnTrust\").

In connection with the restructuring of Permal for the combination with EnTrust, we expect to incur up to $100 million of total restructuring and transition-related costs, of which $43.3 million was incurred during the year ended March 31, 2016. Approximately $40 million to $50 million of the anticipated remaining costs associated with the restructuring are expected to be incurred in the year ending March 31, 2017.

In addition to the $43.3 million of expenses related to the restructuring of Permal for the combination with EnTrust and the $21.4 million charge related to the Royce management equity plan, as discussed above, the year ended March 31, 2016, included pre-tax impairment charges of $371.0 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, related to Permal indefinite-life intangible assets, inclusive of the related intangible asset from Fauchier Partners Management Limited (\"Fauchier\"). The year ended March 31, 2015, included a pre-tax, non-operating charge of $107.1 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, related to the refinancing of our previously outstanding 5.5% Senior Notes, as well as $35.8 million in expenses related to the integration of two of our existing affiliates, Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. (\"Batterymarch\") and Legg Mason Global Asset Management, LLC (\"LMGAA\") into QS Investors. Average AUM and total revenues decreased in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, as further discussed below.\nTotal AUM decreased during the year ended March 31, 2016, due to the negative impact of market performance and other and net client outflows in both long-term and liquidity AUM, which were offset in part by the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure in October 2015.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides additional information regarding our financial condition and results of operations.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDuring fiscal 2016, while the U.S. economic environment was characterized by continued growth and improving fundamentals, the business environment was strongly influenced by overall markets, which remained sensitive to increasing concerns over economic and political conditions in other countries, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's decision to increase the target federal funds rate in December 2015 for the first time since 2006.\nBoth U.S. and international equity markets experienced significant volatility during fiscal 2016. Despite recovering a significant portion of the losses experienced as a result of this volatility, all three major U.S. equity market indices decreased during fiscal 2016, after increasing for the past two fiscal years, while bond indices were mixed, as illustrated in the table below:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change for the year ended March 31:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indices(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dow Jones Industrial Average(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P 500(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASDAQ Composite Index(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Indices are trademarks of Dow Jones & Company, McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., and Barclays Capital, respectively, which are not affiliated with Legg Mason.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Excludes the impact of the reinvestment of dividends and stock splits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board increased the target federal funds rate for the first time since 2006, from 0.25% to 0.50%.

2015. Total net client outflows were $26.1 billion, consisting of net client outflows from the liquidity and long-term asset classes of $14.9 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively. Net long-term asset outflows were comprised of equity and fixed income net outflows of $10.8 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. Equity net outflows were primarily in products managed by Royce, for which outflows are expected to continue for the near-term, and ClearBridge Investments, LLC ( ClearBridge\u201d), offset in part by equity net inflows at QS Investors. Fixed income net outflows were primarily in products managed by Western Asset Management Company (\"Western Asset\") and Permal, offset in part by fixed income net inflows at Brandywine Global\nInvestment Management, LLC (\"Brandywine\"). We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in the equity asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. than would outflows in other asset classes. Market performance and other was $(15.3) billion and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was $1.4 billion. Acquisitions of $6.9 billion primarily relate to the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure in October 2015.\nAUM at March 31, 2015, was $702.7 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion, or 0.1%, from March 31, 2014. Total net client outflows were $5.7 billion, as net client outflows of $22.2 billion from the liquidity asset class were substantially offset by $16.5 billion of net client inflows into long-term asset classes. In fiscal 2015, we experienced net inflows into long-term asset classes for the only time since fiscal 2007. Net long-term asset inflows were comprised of fixed income net inflows of $19.2 billion offset in part by equity net outflows of $2.7 billion. Fixed income net inflows were primarily in products managed by Brandywine and Western Asset. Equity net outflows were primarily in products managed by Royce and QS Investors and were partially offset by equity inflows at ClearBridge and Brandywine. Market performance and other totaled $20.1 billion, as the positive impact of market performance and other of $32.9 billion was offset in part by the reclassification of $12.8 billion of client assets from AUM to AUA in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as further discussed below. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was $(18.5) billion. Acquisitions (dispositions), net, totaled $5.0 billion, with $9.5 billion related to the acquisition of Martin Currie and $5.0 billion related to the acquisition of QS Investors, offset in part by $9.5 billion related to the disposition of LMIC.\nOur investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice.

Fees for equity assets are generally higher, averaging approximately 70 basis points, 75 basis points and 85 basis points for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The average fee rate for equity assets has declined over the last four years due to a shift in the mix of equity assets from higher fee equity products to lower fee equity products. This compares to fees for fixed income assets, which averaged approximately 30 basis points for each of the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and liquidity assets, which averaged under 10 basis points (reflecting the impact of current advisory fee waivers due to the low interest rate environment) for each of the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. Equity assets are primarily managed by ClearBridge, Royce, Brandywine, Permal, QS Investors, Martin Currie and RARE Infrastructure; fixed income assets are primarily managed by Western Asset, Brandywine, and Permal; and liquidity assets are managed by Western Asset. Fee rates for assets distributed through Legg Mason Global Distribution, which are predominately retail in nature, averaged approximately 45 basis points for the year ended March 31, 2016, and approximately 50 basis points for each of the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, while fee rates for assets distributed\nthrough the Affiliate/Other channel averaged approximately 35 basis points for each of the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nInvestment Performance\nOverall investment performance of our AUM for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was mixed compared to relevant benchmarks.\nYear ended March 31, 2016\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, U.S. indices produced mixed returns. The best performing was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, returning 2.1%. These returns were achieved in an economic environment characterized by unexpected declines in oil prices, a strong U.S. dollar, along with a slow-to-recover U.S. economy, and Chinese currency devaluation.\nIn the fixed income markets, in December 2015, the Federal Reserve raised its target rate 0.25%, representing the Federal Reserve's first step toward monetary policy normalization, however, expectations of future Federal Reserve interest rate increases lessened as forecasts pointed to fewer future rate increases. This resulted in the yield curve continuing to flatten over the fiscal year as many long-dated yields declined.\nThe lowest performing fixed income sector for the year ended March 31, 2016, was high yield bonds, as measured by the Barclays U.S. High Yield Index, which declined 3.7%. The best performing fixed income sector for the year ended March 31, 2016, was U.S. Government bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Government Index, which returned 2.4%.\nYear ended March 31, 2015\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, most U.S. indices produced positive returns. The best performing was the NASDAQ Composite, which returned 16.7%. These returns were achieved in an economic environment characterized by uneven global growth and heightened sensitivity to economic news such as declining oil prices and unrest in the Middle East.\nIn the fixed income markets, the Federal Reserve kept the target rate and discount rate steady while signaling an increase in the Federal Reserve funds target rate in the near term. Overall, the yield curve flattened over the fiscal year as many long-dated yields declined.\nThe lowest performing fixed income sector for the year ended March 31, 2015, was high yield bonds, as measured by the Barclays U.S. High Yield Index, which returned 2.0%. The best performing fixed income sector for the year ended March 31, 2015, was corporate bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. Credit Index, which returned 6.7%.\nYear ended March 31, 2014\nFor the year ended March 31, 2014, most U.S. indices produced positive returns. The best performing was the NASDAQ Composite, which returned 28.5%. These returns were achieved in an economic environment characterized by uneven global growth and heightened sensitivity to economic news, such as concerns for economic growth in China and the then ongoing Ukraine/Russia crisis.\nIn the fixed income markets, the Federal Reserve kept the target rate and discount rate steady while tapering the bond-buying program. The yield curve steepened over the fiscal year but flattened in the last quarter as many long-dated yields declined.\nThe lowest performing fixed income sector for the year ended March 31, 2014, was U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (\"TIPS\"), as measured by the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index, which declined 6.5%. The best performing fixed income sector for the year ended March 31, 2014, was high yield bonds as measured by the Barclays U.S. High Yield Bond Index, which returned 7.5%.\nThe following table presents a summary of the percentages of our AUM by strategy(1) that outpaced their respective benchmarks as of March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, for the trailing 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year

strategies are an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts, investment funds, and other products) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective. In the case of separate accounts, the investment performance of the account is based upon the performance of the strategy to which the account has been assigned. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in their strategies. For those managers which manage both separate accounts and investment funds in the same strategy, the performance comparison for all of the assets is based upon the performance of the separate account.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 91%, 90% and 91% of total AUM is included in strategy AUM, respectively, although not all strategies have three-, five-, and ten-year histories. Total strategy AUM includes liquidity assets. Certain assets are not included in reported performance comparisons. These include: accounts that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines outlined above; accounts in strategies not marketed to potential clients; accounts that have not yet been assigned to a strategy; and certain smaller products at some of our affiliates.\nPast performance is not indicative of future results. For AUM included in institutional and retail separate accounts and investment funds included in the same strategy as separate accounts, performance comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance. For investment funds (including fund-of-hedge funds) which are not managed in a separate account format, performance comparisons are based on net-of-fee performance.

The funds within this group are representative of the performance of significant investment strategies we offer, that as of March 31, 2016, constituted an aggregate of approximately $433 billion, or approximately 65% of our total AUM. The only meaningful exclusion of funds are our funds-of-hedge funds strategies, which involve privately placed hedge funds, and represent only 2% of our total AUM as of March 31, 2016, for which investment performance is not made publicly available. Presenting investment returns of funds provides a relevant representation of our performance while avoiding the many complexities relating to factors such as multiple fee structures, bundled pricing, and asset level break points, that would arise in reporting performance for strategies or other product aggregations.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Also during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, approximately $12.8 billion of assets previously reported as AUM, primarily related to a low-fee global sovereign mandate for which investment discretion had abated over time, were reclassified to AUA. We experienced significant AUA outflows during the year ended March 31, 2015 as a result of one client withdrawing approximately $80 billion. These redemptions did not have a material impact on our net income due to their low fee nature.\nAs of March 31, 2016 and 2015, AUA was approximately $39 billion and $35 billion, respectively. AUA as of March 31, 2016 was comprised of approximately $17 billion related to QS Investors, approximately $10 billion related to Western Asset, approximately $8 billion related to ClearBridge, approximately $2 billion related to Permal, and approximately $2 billion related to Brandywine. AUA fee rates vary with the level of non-discretionary service provided. Our average annualized fee rate related to AUA was approximately 10 basis points for the year ended March 31, 2016 and was in the low single digit basis points for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase in the average fee rate was due to the previously discussed $80 billion redemption of very low fee AUA in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Fees for AUA, aggregating $41 million and $30 million, are considered servicing fees and are therefore recorded in Distribution and service fees in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Prior to fiscal 2015, fees for AUA were not material.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation, we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles. The consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. We also hold investments in other consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments, which is recorded in Other non-operating income (expense), is reflected in Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. See Notes 1, 3, and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the consolidation of investment vehicles.\nOperating Revenues\nThe components of Total Operating Revenues (in millions), and the dollar and percentage changes between periods were as follows:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 Compared to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 Compared to 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment advisory fees:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Separate accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>826.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>777.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,409.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,544.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,501.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(135.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution and service fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(61\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,660.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,819.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,741.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(158.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Operating Revenues for the year ended March 31, 2016, were $2.66 billion, a decrease of 6% from $2.82 billion for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our operating revenue yield, excluding performance fees, from 39 basis points to 38 basis points, a 3% decrease in average AUM, and a decrease in performance fees. Although equity and fixed income AUM together comprised a higher percentage of our total average AUM for the year ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2015, our operating revenue yield, excluding performance fees, declined due to a less favorable product mix, with lower yielding products comprising a higher percentage of our total average AUM for the year ended March 31, 2016, as compared to March 31, 2015.\nTotal Operating Revenues for the year ended March 31, 2015, were $2.82 billion, an increase of 3% from $2.74 billion for the year ended March 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to the impact of a 6% increase in average long-term AUM, offset in part by a decrease in performance fees. Although equity AUM comprised a higher percentage of our total AUM\nas of March 31, 2015, as compared to March 31, 2014, our operating revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 39 basis points in each of the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, due to a slightly less favorable product mix, with lower yielding products comprising a higher percentage of our total average AUM for the year ended March 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2014.\nInvestment Advisory Fees from Separate Accounts\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased $1.9 million, to $826.1 million, as compared to $824.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. Of this increase, $11.4 million was due to RARE Infrastructure after it was acquired in October 2015, $8.7 million was due to a full year of results for Martin Currie, which was acquired in October 2014, $6.8 million was the result of higher average equity assets managed by Brandywine, $6.9 million was the result of higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine and $3.1 million was the result of higher average assets managed by Permal. These increases were substantially offset by a decrease of $27.7 million due to the sale of LMIC in November 2014 and a decrease of $6.9 million due to lower averaged fixed income assets managed by Western Asset.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, investment advisory fees from separate accounts increased $46.8 million, or 6%, to $824.2 million, as compared to $777.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2014. Of this increase, $34.7 million was due to higher average equity assets managed by ClearBridge, $29.5 million was due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Western Asset and Brandywine, and $17.4 million was due to Martin Currie, which was acquired in October 2014, including an increase in revenues related to Martin Currie Australia (\"MC Australia\"), which includes our legacy Australian asset manager. These increases were offset in part by approximately $25 million of revenues associated with certain existing client assets which were reclassified from AUM to AUA during the year ended March 31, 2015, as previously discussed. These revenues are now included in Distribution and service fees for fiscal 2015. The increases were also offset in part by a decrease of $15.8 million resulting from the sale of LMIC in November 2014.\nInvestment Advisory Fees from Funds\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, investment advisory fees from funds decreased $135.5 million, or 9%, to $1.41 billion, as compared to $1.54 billion for the year ended March 31, 2015. Of this decrease, $104.9 million was due to lower average equity assets managed by Royce, $43.9 million was due to lower average assets managed by Permal and approximately $28 million was related to revenues which, due to a change in the distributor for certain funds in May 2015, are no longer included in advisory fee revenue. Revenues related to these funds is included in Distribution and service fees for fiscal 2016. These decreases were offset in part by an increase of $28.8 million due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Western Asset and Brandywine and a net increase of $18.3 million in fees from liquidity assets, largely due to a reduction in fee waivers on liquidity funds managed by Western Asset.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, investment advisory fees from funds increased $43.2 million, or 3%, to $1.54 billion, as compared to $1.50 billion for the year ended March 31, 2014. Of this increase, $80.1 million was due to higher average equity assets managed by ClearBridge, $30.5 million was due to higher average fixed income assets managed by Brandywine and Western Asset, and $14.7 million was due to Martin Currie, which was acquired in October 2014, including the increase in revenues related to MC Australia. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $40.5 million due to lower average equity assets managed by Royce, a decrease of $33.8 million due to lower average assets managed by Permal, and a net decrease of $9.3 million in fees from liquidity assets, due to fee waivers on liquidity funds managed by Western Asset.\nInvestment Advisory Performance Fees\nOf our total AUM as of March 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately 7%, 7%, and 6% was in accounts that were eligible to earn performance fees. For the year ended March 31, 2016, Investment advisory performance fees decreased $41.5 million to $42.0 million, as compared to $83.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to lower fees earned on assets managed at Permal and Brandywine.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, investment advisory performance fees decreased $23.6 million to $83.5 million, as compared to $107.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, primarily due to lower fees earned on assets managed at Permal, offset in part by an increase in fees earned on assets managed at Brandywine.\nDistribution and Service Fees\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, Distribution and service fees increased $20.3 million, or 6%, to $381.5 million, as compared to $361.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, primarily as a result of approximately $29 million of revenue\nwhich is included in Distribution and service fees in fiscal 2016, due to a change in the distributor for certain funds in May 2015. Revenues related to these funds were previously included in Investment advisory fees from funds. An increase of $11.6 million in advisement fees associated with our AUA also contributed to the increase. These increases were offset in part by a decline in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and service fees.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, Distribution and service fees increased $13.6 million, or 4%, to $361.2 million, as compared to $347.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, primarily as a result of approximately $25 million of revenues related to client assets that were reclassified from AUM to AUA, as well as an increase in average mutual fund AUM subject to distribution and service fees. As previously discussed, the revenues associated with AUA are included in Distribution and service fees beginning in fiscal 2015.

The impairment charges relate to our Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts asset and Permal trade name. The impairment charges resulted from a number of current trends and factors, including (i) periods of moderate inflows or outflows over recent years and related reductions in AUM; (ii) a reduction in growth assumptions for the next five years; (iii) a decrease in projected margins for the next two years; and (iv) an increase in the rate used to discount projected future cash flows primarily due to company specific factors including continued market influences. These changes resulted in a reduction of the projected cash flows and our overall assessment of fair value of the assets, such that the fair values of the Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts asset and Permal trade name declined below their carrying values, and accordingly were impaired by $364.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. See Critical Accounting Policies and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment charges.\nOther\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, Other expenses decreased $35.6 million, or 18%, to $163.0 million, as compared to $198.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to a $33.4 million credit related to fair value adjustments to decrease the contingent consideration liabilities associated with the acquisitions of Martin Currie and Fauchier and a $14.6 million decrease in expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds. These decreases were partially offset by a $13.6 million increase in professional fees, due in part to costs for the acquisitions of Clarion Partners and EnTrust.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, Other expenses increased $2.6 million, or 1%, to $198.6 million, as compared to $196.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, primarily due to a $5.9 million increase in travel and entertainment expenses, a $5.3 million increase in advertising expenses, and a $4.7 million increase in professional fees.

The decrease of $6.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in interest accruals for uncertain tax positions, offset in part by interest accretion on contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of Martin Currie and RARE Infrastructure.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, Interest expense increased 10% to $58.3 million, as compared to $52.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in interest accruals for uncertain tax positions and interest accretion on Contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of QS Investors and Martin Currie.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, Other expense, net, decreased $59.3 million, to expense of $26.0 million, as compared to expense of $85.3 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to a $107.1 million charge recognized in the prior year related to the refinancing of our 5.5% Senior Notes in July 2014. This decrease was offset in part by net market losses of $27.0 million on corporate investments, which are not offset in compensation, net market losses of $10.6 million on seed capital investments and assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are offset by corresponding increases in compensation, mentioned above, net market losses of $5.6 million on investments of consolidated sponsored investment vehicles that are not designated as consolidated investment vehicles (\"CIVs\"), which have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., as the losses are fully attributable to noncontrolling interests, and a $4.5 million loss on a foreign currency forward contract related to the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, Other income (expense), net, decreased $118.1 million, to expense of $85.3 million, as compared to income of $32.8 million in fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a $107.1 million charge related to the refinancing of the 5.5% Senior Notes in July 2014. A reduction in net market gains of $7.6 million on seed capital investments and assets invested for deferred compensation plans, which are offset by corresponding decreases in compensation mentioned above, and a reduction in net market gains of $5.3 million on corporate investments, which are not offset in compensation, also contributed to the decrease.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Loss) of Consolidated Investment Vehicles\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, Other non-operating income (expense) of consolidated investment vehicles, net, decreased $13.1 million to expense of $7.2 million, as compared to income of $5.9 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to the deconsolidation of a CIV during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, and net market losses on investments of certain CIVs.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, Other non-operating income (expense) of consolidated investment vehicles, net, increased $3.5 million to income of $5.9 million, primarily due to an increase in net market gains on investments of certain CIVs.\nIncome Tax Provision\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, the provision for income taxes was $7.7 million, as compared to $125.3 million in the year ended March 31, 2015.

The change in the effective tax rate was largely due to the impact of the $371.0 million of impairment charges recognized in lower tax rate jurisdictions. In November 2015, the U.K. Finance Bill 2015 was enacted, which reduced the main U.K. corporate tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017, and to 18% effective April 1, 2020. The reductions in the U.K. corporate tax rate resulted in tax benefits of $8.4 million in fiscal 2016. The impact of CIVs increased the effective rate by 23.8 percentage points for the year ended March 31, 2016, and decreased the effective rate by 0.5 percentage points for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, the provision for income taxes was $125.3 million, as compared to $137.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2014. The effective tax rate was 34.0% for the year ended March 31, 2015, as compared to 32.8% for the year ended March 31, 2014. The change in the effective rate was primarily related to the impact of $19.2 million of income tax benefits recorded in fiscal 2014 with respect to U.K. corporate tax rate reductions, which impacted the effective tax rate by 4.6 percentage points in fiscal 2014. The impact of CIVs decreased the effective rate by 0.5 percentage points for the year ended March 31, 2015, and increased the effective rate by 0.2 percentage points for the year ended March 31, 2014.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and Operating Margin\nNet Loss Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2016, totaled $25.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. of $237.1 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, in the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the pre-tax impairment charges of $371.0 million ($296.8 million, net of income tax benefits, or $2.76 per diluted share) related to our indefinite-life intangible assets in the year ended March 31, 2016, offset in part by the pre-tax non-operating charge of $107.1 million ($68.5 million, net of income tax benefits, or $0.59 per diluted share) recognized in the year ended March 31, 2015, in connection with the refinancing of the 5.5% Senior Notes. Operating margin was 1.9% for the year ended March 31, 2016, compared to 17.7% for the year ended March 31, 2015, with the decrease primarily attributable to the impairment charges.\nNet Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2015, totaled $237.1 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared to $284.8 million, or $2.33 per diluted share, in the year ended March 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the pre-tax, non-operating charge of $107.1 million ($68.5 million, net of income tax benefits, or $0.59 per diluted share) related to the refinancing of the 5.5% Senior Notes in the year ended March 31, 2015, offset in part by a $20.7 million decrease in costs related to closed-end fund launches, and the net impact of increased operating revenues. Operating margin was 17.7% for the year ended March 31, 2015, compared to 15.7% for the year ended March 31, 2014.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\nAs supplemental information, we are providing performance measures for \"Adjusted Income\" and \"Operating Margin, as Adjusted\" and a liquidity measure for \"Adjusted EBITDA\", each of which are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ( non-GAAP\u201d). Our management uses these measures as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing our period-to-period operating performance and liquidity.\nAdjusted Income decreased to $370.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, from $378.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2015; however, due to a reduction in weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases, Adjusted Income per diluted share increased to $3.36 per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2016, from $3.26 per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in Adjusted Income was primarily attributable to the net impact of decreased operating revenues, offset in part by the impact of the pre-tax, non-operating charge of $107.1 million ($68.5 million, net of income tax, or $0.59 per diluted share) related to the refinancing of the 5.5% Senior Notes in the prior year. Operating Margin, as Adjusted, for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, was 18.6% and 23.0%, respectively. Operating Margin, as Adjusted, for the year ended March 31, 2016, was reduced by 2.0 percentage points due to costs associated with the restructuring of Permal for the combination with EnTrust, by 1.0 percentage point due to the compensation charge associated with the Royce management equity plan grant, and by 0.4 percentage points for real estate related charges recognized in the current year associated with reduced space requirements. Operating Margin, as Adjusted, for the year ended March 31, 2015 was reduced by 1.7 percentage points due to costs associated with the integration of Batterymarch and LMGAA into QS Investors and various other corporate initiatives.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, was $621.7 million and $686.5 million, respectively. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of a decrease in cash provided by operating activities.\nAdjusted Income decreased to $378.8 million, or $3.26 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2015, from $417.8 million, or $3.41 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the pre-tax, non-operating charge of $107.1 million ($68.5 million, net of income tax, or $0.59 per diluted share) related to the refinancing of the 5.5% Senior Notes in the year ended March 31, 2015, offset in part by the net impact of increased operating revenues. Operating Margin, as Adjusted, for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, was 23.0% and 22.0%, respectively. Operating Margin, as Adjusted, for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, was reduced by 1.7 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively, due to costs associated with the integration of Batterymarch and LMGAA into QS Investors and various other corporate initiatives. Operating Margin, as Adjusted, for the year ended March 31, 2014, was also reduced by 1.0 percentage point due to structuring fees related to closed-end fund and real estate investment trust launches during that fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, was $686.5 million and $617.1 million, respectively. The $69.4 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of an increase in cash provided by operating activities.\nAdjusted Income\nWe define Adjusted Income\u201d as Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment, if any. We also adjust for non-core items that are not reflective of our economic performance, such as intangible asset impairments, the impact of fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities, if any, and the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite-life intangible assets.\nWe believe that Adjusted Income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non-cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not made significant acquisitions. We also believe that Adjusted Income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business.\nAdjusted Income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability, and therefore, is most readily reconcilable to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. determined under GAAP. This measure is provided in addition to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., but is not a substitute for Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income, of other companies. Further, Adjusted Income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under GAAP. Fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities may or may not provide a tax benefit, depending on the tax attributes of the acquisition transaction. We consider Adjusted Income to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies, as an indicator of value, and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not made significant acquisitions.\nIn calculating Adjusted Income, we adjust for the impact of the amortization of management contract assets and impairment of indefinite-life intangible assets, and add (subtract) the impact of fair value adjustments on contingent consideration liabilities, if any, all of which arise from acquisitions, to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to reflect the fact that these items distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Deferred taxes on indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under GAAP absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business. Because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization, we add this benefit to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. in the calculation of Adjusted Income. However, because of our net operating loss carry-forward, we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time. Conversely, we subtract the non-cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment charges and U.K. tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite-life intangible assets, if applicable, that have been recognized under GAAP. These adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to other periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions, including any related impairments.\nShould a disposition, impairment charge or other non-core item occur, its impact on Adjusted Income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm. Accordingly, we monitor these items and their related impact, including taxes, on Adjusted Income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures.\nAlthough depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non-cash expenses, we do not add these charges in calculating Adjusted Income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement.\nA reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. to Adjusted Income (in thousands except per share amounts) is as follows:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,032\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>284,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus (less):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration fair value adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,375\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes on intangible assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax amortization benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. tax rate adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,361\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,164\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income (Loss) per diluted share Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc.

We adjust for the impact of amortization of management contract assets and the impact of fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities, if any, which arise from acquisitions to reflect the fact that these items distort comparison of our operating results with results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Impairment charges and income (loss) of CIVs are removed from Operating Income (Loss) in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations. We use Operating Revenues, as Adjusted, in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate\nour distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed-end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. Operating Revenues, as Adjusted, also include our advisory revenues we receive from CIVs that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP.\nWe believe that Operating Margin, as Adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities. It excludes items that have no impact on Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, amortization related to intangible assets, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, if any, impairment charges, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above. The consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact on Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc.

The net change of other assets and liabilities adjustment aligns with the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This definition results in a metric that is the same amount as EBITDA used in covenants in our revolving credit facility agreement.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as a liquidity measure that provides additional information with regard to our compliance with debt covenants and ability to meet future working capital requirements. This measure is provided in addition to Cash provided by operating activities and may not be comparable to non-GAAP liquidity measures, including measures of EBITDA or cash flow measures, of other companies. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is not to be confused\nwith Cash provided by operating activities or other measures of cash flows under GAAP, and is provided as a supplement to, and not in replacement of, a GAAP measure.\nA reconciliation of Cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Trailing twelve months ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities, GAAP basis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus (less):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt redemption payments allocated to operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net of accretion and amortization of debt discounts and premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change of other assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118,919\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, principally transition-related costs in fiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>621,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>686,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>617,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe primary objective of our capital structure is to appropriately support our business strategies and to provide needed liquidity at all times, including maintaining required capital in certain subsidiaries. Liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations. Our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses. We intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business. These opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require, among other things, and subject to existing covenants, the raising of additional equity capital and/or the issuance of additional debt.\nThe consolidation of variable interest entities discussed above does not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no rights to the benefits from, nor do we bear the risks associated with, the assets and liabilities of the CIVs and other consolidated sponsored investment vehicles beyond our investments in and investment advisory fees generated from these vehicles, which are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, creditors of the CIVs and other consolidated sponsored investment vehicles have no recourse to our general credit beyond the level of our investment, if any, so we do not consider these liabilities to be our obligations.\nOur assets consist primarily of intangible assets, goodwill, cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, and investment advisory and related fee receivables. Our assets have been principally funded by equity capital, long-term debt and the results of our operations. At March 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents, total assets, long-term debt and stockholders' equity were $1.3 billion, $7.5 billion, $1.7 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Total assets include amounts related to CIVs of $0.1 billion.\nCash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in liquid domestic and non-domestic money market funds that hold principally domestic and non-domestic corporate commercial paper and bonds, government and agency securities, and bank deposits. We have not recognized any losses on these investments. Our monitoring of cash and cash equivalents partially mitigates the potential that material risks may be associated with these balances.\nThe following table summarizes our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended March 31 (in millions):\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>568.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by/(used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(244.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(208.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by/(used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>465.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(507.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(639.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>659.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>669.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>933.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,329.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>669.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>858.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016, were $454.5 million, primarily related to Net Loss, adjusted for non-cash items. Cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2015 were $568.1 million, primarily related to Net Income, adjusted for non-cash items, and net activity related to CIVs. Cash inflows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 were $437.3 million, primarily related to Net Income, adjusted for non-cash items, offset in part by net purchases of trading and other investments and a decrease in net activity related to CIVs, primarily due to the wind-down of a consolidated loan obligation (\"CLO\"). See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the CLO.\nCash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal 2016, were $244.6 million, primarily related to payments associated with the acquisitions of RARE Infrastructure and PK Investments, and the investment in Precidian Investments, aggregating $234.1 million (net of acquired cash). Cash outflows used in investing activities during fiscal 2015, were $208.0 million, primarily related to payments associated with the acquisitions of Martin Currie and QS Investors of $183.7 million (net of acquired cash) and payments made for fixed assets of $45.8 million; offset in part by the proceeds from businesses sold of $47.0 million. Cash inflows provided by investing activities during fiscal 2014, were $137.6 million, primarily related to net activity related to CIVs, offset in part by payments made for fixed assets.\nCash inflows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016, were $465.7 million, primarily related to the proceeds of the issuance of $699.8 million of long-term debt, offset in part by the repurchase of 4.5 million shares of our common stock for $209.6 million. Cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal 2015, were $507.0 million, primarily related to the repayment of long-term debt of $645.8 million, the repurchase of 6.9 million shares of our common stock for $356.5 million, the repayment of long-term debt of CIVs of $79.2 million, and dividends paid of $70.8 million, offset in part by the proceeds from the issuance of $658.8 million of long-term debt. Cash outflows used in financing activities during fiscal 2014, were $639.0 million, primarily related to the repayment of long-term debt of $500.4 million, the repayment of long-term debt of CIVs of $133.0 million, the repurchase of 9.7 million shares of our common stock for $360.0 million, and dividends paid of $62.0 million, offset in part by the proceeds from the long-term debt issuances of $393.7 million.\nFinancing Transactions\nThe table below reflects our primary sources of financing (in thousands) as of March 31, 2016:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available at March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount Outstanding at\nMarch 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.7% Senior Notes due July 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.70%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.95% Senior Notes due July 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.95%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.75% Senior Notes Due March 2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 2026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.625% Senior Notes due January 2044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.625%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 2044\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.375% Junior Subordinated Notes Due March 2056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.375%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 2056\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eurocurrency Rate + 1.25% + 0.175% annual commitment fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 2020\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn March 2016, we issued $250 million of 6.375% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2056 (the \"2056 Notes\") and $450 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\"). The net proceeds of these offerings were used to finance the acquisitions of Clarion Partners in April 2016 and EnTrust in May 2016, as further discussed below and in Note 18 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2015, we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement which provides for a $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, and borrowed $40 million under this revolving credit facility, which remained outstanding as of March 31, 2016. The proceeds were used to repay the $40 million of outstanding borrowings under our previous revolving credit facility, which were used to partially finance the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure in October 2015, as further discussed below. In May 2016, we used $460 million of additional borrowings under the new revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of EnTrust and to replenish cash used to complete the acquisitions of Clarion Partners and RARE Infrastructure. The amount of total borrowings outstanding under this facility is $500 million as of the date of filing.\nThe new revolving credit facility may be increased by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, to $1.5 billion, subject to the approval of the lenders, expires in December 2020, and can be repaid at any time. This revolving credit facility is available to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes.\nThe financial covenants under our credit agreement were modified in March 2016 and include: maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 to 1 for the period from March 31, 2016 through September 30, 2016, 3.25 to 1 for the period from October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and 3.0 to 1 thereafter; and minimum EBITDA to interest ratio of 4.0 to 1. Debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money, excluding non-recourse debt of CIVs and capital leases. Under these net debt covenants, our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or $300 million, by the lesser of 50% of the aggregate amount of our seed capital investments or $125 million, and an amount equal to 50% of our hybrid capital securities. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus/minus tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, any extraordinary expense or losses, any non-cash charges, and certain transition-related costs, as defined in the agreements. As of March 31, 2016, Legg Mason's net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.3 to 1 and EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 13.0 to 1, and therefore, Legg Mason has maintained compliance with the applicable covenants.\nIf our net income (loss) significantly declines, or if we spend our available cash, it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants. If we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure at a time when we either have outstanding borrowings under this facility, want to utilize available borrowings, or otherwise desire to keep borrowings available, we may elect to take a number of actions, including reducing our expenses in order to increase our EBITDA, using available cash to repay all or a portion of our outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt. Using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions. Entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments.\nIn May 2012, we refinanced our then outstanding 2.5% Senior Convertible Notes (the \"Convertible Notes\"). The refinancing was effected through the issuance of $650 million of 5.5% Senior Notes, the net proceeds of which, together with cash on hand and $250 million of remaining borrowing capacity under a then existing revolving credit facility, were used to repurchase all $1.25 billion of the Convertible Notes. The terms of the repurchase included the issuance of warrants to the holders of the Convertible Notes. The warrants replaced a conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, and provide for the purchase, in the aggregate and subject to adjustment, of 14.2 million shares of our common stock, on a net share settled basis, at an exercise price of $88 per share. The warrants expire in July 2017 and can be settled, at our election, in either shares of common stock or cash.\nIn June 2012, we entered into an unsecured credit agreement which provided for a $500 million revolving credit facility and a $500 million term loan, which was repaid in fiscal 2014, as further discussed below. The proceeds of the term loan were used to repay $500 million of outstanding borrowings under a previous revolving credit facility, which was then terminated.\nIn January 2014, we issued $400 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2044, the net proceeds of which, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the $450 million of then outstanding borrowings under the five-year term loan entered into in conjunction with the unsecured credit agreement noted above. The 5.625% Senior Notes were sold at a discount of $6.3 million, which is being amortized to interest expense over the 30 year term.\nAlso in January 2014, we entered into a $250 million incremental revolving credit facility, which was contemplated in, and was in addition to the $500 million revolving credit facility available under, the credit agreement we entered into in June 2012. These revolving credit facilities were available to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes and were to expire in June 2017. There were no borrowings outstanding under either facility as of March 31, 2015. In October 2015, Legg Mason borrowed $40 million under these facilities to partially finance the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure, which was repaid in December 2015 upon entering into a new unsecured credit agreement, as discussed above. These revolving credit facilities were terminated effective upon the repayment.\nIn June 2014, we issued $250 million of 2.7% Senior Notes due 2019 at a discount of $0.6 million, $250 million of 3.95% Senior Notes due 2024 at a discount of $0.5 million, and an additional $150 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2044 at a premium of $9.8 million. In July 2014, these proceeds of $659 million, net of related fees, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the then outstanding $650 million of the 5.5% Senior Notes. The retirement of the 5.5% Senior Notes resulted in a pre-tax, non-operating charge of $107.1 million in July 2014, consisting of a cash make-whole premium payment of $98.6 million, net of $0.6 million from a reverse treasury lock, to call the 5.5% Senior Notes and $8.5 million associated with existing deferred costs and original issue discount.\nOur outstanding revolving credit facility agreement is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies. The interest rate and annual commitment fee on our revolving line of credit are based on the higher credit rating of the two rating agencies. In June 2011, our rating by one of these agencies was downgraded one grade below the other. Should the other agency downgrade our rating, absent an upgrade from the former agency, our interest costs will rise modestly.\nSee Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.\nOther Transactions\nWe expect that over the next 12 months cash generated from our operating activities and available cash on hand will be adequate to support our operating and investing cash needs, other than acquisitions, as discussed below. In May 2016, we utilized $460 million of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and the proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes and the 2056 Notes to finance the acquisition of EnTrust, as further discussed below, and to replenish cash used to complete the acquisitions of Clarion Partners in April 2016 and RARE Infrastructure in October 2015. We may also utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, seed capital investments in new products, repurchase of shares of our common stock, repayment of outstanding debt, or payment of increased dividends. In addition to our ordinary operating cash needs, we anticipate other cash needs during the next 12 months, as discussed below.\nAcquisitions\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RARE Infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Martin Currie\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PK Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>QS Investors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fauchier\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum Remaining Contingent Consideration(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>467.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>609.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-current Contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance as of March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Using the applicable exchange rate as of March 31, 2016 for amounts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn May 2, 2016, we closed the transaction to combine Permal and EnTrust, to create EnTrustPermal, of which we own 65%. The transaction required a cash payment of $400 million, which was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as well as a portion of the proceeds from the 2026 Notes and the 2056 Notes that were issued in March 2016. In connection with the combination, we expect to incur restructuring and transition costs of approximately $100 million, of which approximately 15% are non-cash charges. As of March 31, 2016, approximately $43 million of these charges have been incurred, and approximately $24 million have been paid. A significant portion of the remaining costs will be paid in the year ending March 31, 2017. See Notes 2 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn April 13, 2016, we acquired a majority interest in Clarion Partners. The acquisition required a cash payment of $577 million, which was funded with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes and the 2056 Notes in March 2016. In conjunction with the acquisition, we committed to provide $100 million of seed capital to Clarion Partners products within two years of closing. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn October 21, 2015, we acquired a majority interest in RARE Infrastructure. The acquisition required an initial cash payment of approximately $214 million (using the foreign exchange rate as of October 21, 2015 for the 296 million Australian dollar payment), which was funded with $40 million of net borrowings under our previous revolving credit facility, as well as existing cash resources. Contingent consideration may be due March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, aggregating up to approximately $81 million (using the foreign exchange rate as of March 31, 2016 for the maximum 106 million Australia dollar amount per the contract), dependent on the achievement of certain net revenue targets, and subject to potential catch-up adjustments extending through March 31, 2019. Noncontrolling interests of 25% are subject to put and call provisions that may result in future cash outlays.\nOn October 1, 2014, we acquired all outstanding equity interests of Martin Currie. The transaction included an initial cash payment of $203 million (using the foreign exchange rate as of October 1, 2014 for the \u00a3125 million payment), which was funded from existing cash. Contingent consideration payments may be due on the March 31 following the second and third anniversaries of closing, aggregating up to approximately $467 million (using the foreign exchange rate as of March 31, 2016 for the maximum \u00a3325 million contract amount), inclusive of the payment of certain potential pension and other obligations, and dependent on the achievement of certain financial metrics, as specified in the share purchase agreement, at March 31, 2017 and 2018. No contingent consideration payment was due as of March 31, 2016, for the first anniversary payment. Actual payments to be made may also include amounts for certain potential pension and other obligations that are accounted for separately. In addition, Martin Currie and the trustees of the pension plan referenced above have received a notice that the Pensions Regulator in the U.K. is reviewing the plan's current structure and funding status. While the review is still in process, there can be no assurance that the review will not result in accelerated funding.\nIn December 2015, Martin Currie acquired certain assets of PK Investments. The business acquisition was comprised of an initial cash payment of $5.0 million and a contingent payment, due on December 31, 2017, which is currently estimated at $2.5 million. The amount of any ultimate contingent payment will be based on certain financial metrics. The initial cash payment was funded with existing cash resources.\nEffective May 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition of QS Investors. In July 2016, we may be required to pay up to $10 million for the second anniversary contingent consideration, with the amount of the payment dependent on the achievement\nof certain net revenue targets. We intend to fund any amount due with existing cash resources. In addition, contingent consideration of up to $20 million for the fourth anniversary payment may be due in July 2018, also dependent on the achievement of certain net revenue targets, and subject to a potential catch-up adjustment in the fourth anniversary payment for any second anniversary payment shortfall.\nIn March 2013, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of Fauchier. Contingent consideration of up to approximately $29 million (using the exchange rate as of March 31, 2016, for the \u00a320 million maximum contractual amount), may be due on or about the fourth anniversary of closing, dependent on achieving certain levels of revenue, net of distribution costs.\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the acquisitions of RARE Infrastructure, Martin Currie, QS Investors, and Fauchier.\nOther\nIn March 2016, we implemented an affiliate management equity plan with the management of Royce. Under this management equity plan, minority interests equivalent to 16.9% in the Royce entity were issued to its management team. In addition, in June 2013 and March 2014, we implemented affiliate management equity plans that will entitle certain key employees of Permal and ClearBridge, respectively, to participate in 15% of the future growth of the respective enterprise value (subject to appropriate discounts), if any, as further discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Repurchases of units granted under these plans may impact future liquidity requirements. In conjunction with the acquisition of Clarion Partners, we implemented an affiliate management equity plan similar to the plan implemented for ClearBridge, with immediate vesting for the initial grant.\nCertain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes. Certain affiliates are subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies. All such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements during the periods presented.\nIn January 2015, our Board of Directors authorized $1.0 billion for additional purchases of our common stock, approximately $800 million of which remained available as of March 31, 2016. We intend to utilize up to $90 million of cash generated from future operations to purchase shares of our common stock on a quarterly basis, subject to market conditions and other potential uses of cash.\nFuture Outlook\nAs described above, we currently project that our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our present and foreseeable, near-term liquidity needs, other than for the acquisitions of Clarion Partners in April 2016 and EnTrust in May 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents in excess of our working capital requirements, $689 million of which was used to fund the previously discussed acquisitions of Clarion Partners and EnTrust. As discussed above, we intend to utilize up to $90 million of cash generated from future operations to purchase shares of our common stock during each quarter of the year ending March 31, 2017, subject to market conditions and other cash needs. We temporarily interrupted share repurchases in November 2015 and resumed share repurchases in March 2016. We intend to catch up an additional $12 million in share repurchases in the quarter ending June 30, 2016. In addition, in fiscal 2017, we intend to repay approximately $50 million of the outstanding $500 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, subject to market conditions and other cash needs. After drawing $460 million on our revolving credit facility in May 2016, in connection with the acquisitions of Clarion Partners and EnTrust, subject to compliance with applicable covenants, we have approximately $350 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2020. We do not currently expect to raise incremental debt or equity financing over the next 12 months beyond our current levels, unless we enter into one or more acquisitions or refinancings. Going forward, there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect, events may occur that require additional liquidity in excess of amounts under our revolving credit facility, such as an opportunity to refinance indebtedness, or market conditions might significantly worsen, affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash. If these events result in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs, we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases, reducing operating expenses, reducing our expected expenditures on investments, selling assets (such as investment securities), repatriating earnings from foreign subsidiaries, reducing our dividend, or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and/or employees. Should these types of actions prove insufficient, or should an acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise, we would likely utilize borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or seek to raise additional equity or debt.\nOur liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents, and certain current investment securities. At March 31, 2016, our total liquid assets were $1.7 billion, $689 million of which was used to fund the previously discussed acquisitions of Clarion Partners in April 2016 and EnTrust in May 2016. The remaining $1.0 billion of liquid assets included $378 million of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries. Other net working capital amounts of foreign subsidiaries are not significant. In order to increase our cash available in the U.S. for general corporate purposes, we plan to utilize up to $170 million of foreign cash over the next several years, of which $8.5 million is accumulated foreign earnings. Any additional tax provision associated with these repatriations was previously recognized. No further repatriation of accumulated prior period foreign earnings is currently planned. However, if circumstances change, we will provide for and pay any applicable additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriation of offshore earnings. It is not practical at this time to determine the income tax liability that would result from any further repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings.\nCredit and Liquidity Risk\nCash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a number of high quality financial institutions or funds and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions. The balances with these financial institutions or funds and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation, such as certain contingent obligations, certain guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support. Disclosure is required for any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. We generally do not enter into off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined, other than those described in the Contractual Obligations section that follows and Consolidation discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual and Contingent Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations to make future payments, principally in connection with our long-term debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, acquisition agreements and service agreements. See Notes 6 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments.\nThe following table sets forth these contractual obligations (in millions) by fiscal year, and excludes contractual obligations of CIVs, as we are not responsible or liable for these obligations:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Under the program, certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level. The following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk.\nRevenues and Net Income (Loss)\nThe majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the value of the underlying securities will cause our AUM, and thus our revenues, to decrease. In addition, our fixed income and liquidity AUM are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations, as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts. In the ordinary course of our business, we may also reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. Market conditions, such as the current historical low interest rate environment, may lead us to take such actions. Performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks, and strong markets tend to increase these fees. Declines in market values of AUM will result in reduced fee revenues and net income. We generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets. Declines in market values of AUM in this asset class will have a greater impact on our revenues. In addition, under revenue sharing arrangements, certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs, including compensation. Our net income (loss), profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues, and a change in AUM at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary.\nTrading and Non-Trading Assets\nOur trading and non-trading assets are comprised of investment securities, including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and certain other investment products.\nTrading and other current investments, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2016 and 2015, subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities, excluding CIVs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading investments relating to long-term incentive compensation plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading investments of proprietary fund products and other trading investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity method investments relating to long-term incentive compensation plans, proprietary fund products and other investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total current investments, excluding CIVs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTrading and other current investments of $113.0 million and $89.2 million at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relate to long-term incentive plans which will have offsetting liabilities at the end of the respective vesting periods, but for which the related liabilities may not completely offset at the end of each reporting period due to vesting provisions. Therefore, fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense, non-operating income (expense) and, dependent on the vesting provisions of the plan, our net income (loss).\nApproximately $402.3 million and $365.5 million of trading and other current investments at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non-operating income (expense). Of these amounts, the fluctuations in market value related to approximately $35.8 million and $37.5 million of proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share arrangements. The fluctuations in market value related to approximately $141.3 million and $163.0 million in proprietary fund products as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are substantially offset by gains (losses) on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. Investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated before the related fund establishes a track record, has other investors, or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy.\nNon-trading assets, excluding CIVs, at March 31, 2016 and 2015, subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities, excluding CIVs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in partnerships, LLCs and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity method investments in partnerships and LLCs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-trading assets, excluding CIVs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment securities of CIVs totaled $48.7 million and $48.0 million as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We and certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage a portion of the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations. We do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income (loss) or liquidity.\nInterest Rate Risk\nExposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is substantially mitigated as our $250 million of 3.95% Senior Notes due July 2024, $550 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due July 2044, $450 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due March 2026, and $250 million of 6.375% Junior Subordinated Notes due March 2056 are at fixed interest rates. In June 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap contract, designated as a fair value hedge, to effectively convert our $250 million of 2.7% Senior Notes due July 2019 from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. In addition, the $40 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement as of March 31, 2016, is also subject to fluctuations in interest rates. As of March 31, 2016, and as a result of the interest rate swap and the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, we estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of $2.9 million. On an economic basis, the interest rate swap contract wholly or partially hedges interest rate exposure on operating cash.\nOn April 21, 2016, the interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge was terminated. Therefore, as of this date, the $250 million of 2.7% Senior Notes are at a fixed interest rate. In addition, on April 29, 2016, we entered into a 4.67-year amortizing interest rate swap, designated as a cash flow hedge, that reduces our exposure to interest rate risk on the $500 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nSee Notes 6 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of debt and derivatives and hedging, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nAccounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Understanding these policies, therefore, is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information. Certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Therefore, actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nWe consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments.\nConsolidation\nIn the normal course of our business, we sponsor and manage various types of investment vehicles. For our services, we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees. Our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make, and any earned but uncollected management fees. Uncollected management fees from managed investment vehicles were not material at March 31, 2016, we have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these investment vehicles or their investors, and we did not sell or transfer assets to any of these investment vehicles. In accordance with financial accounting standards, we consolidate certain sponsored investment vehicles, some of which are designated as CIVs.\nCertain investment vehicles we sponsor and are the manager of are considered to be variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") (further described below) while others are considered to be voting rights entities ( VREs\u201d) subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights. Sponsored investment vehicles that are considered VREs are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle, absent substantive investor rights to replace the manager of the entity (kick-out rights). We may also fund the initial cash investment in certain VRE investment vehicles to generate an investment performance track record in order to attract third-party investors in the product. Our initial investment in a new product typically represents 100% of the ownership in that product. As further discussed below, these seed capital investments\u201d are consolidated as long as we maintain a controlling financial interest in the product, but they are not designated as CIVs unless the investment is longer-term.\nA VIE is an entity which does not have adequate equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; or the equity investors, as a group, do not have the normal characteristics of equity for a potential controlling financial interest.\nInvestment Company VIEs\nFor most sponsored investment fund VIEs deemed to be investment companies, including money market funds, we determine we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE if we absorb a majority of the VIE's expected losses, or receive a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns, if any. Our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker if certain criteria are met. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of an investment company VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders; economic participation of all parties, including how fees are earned and paid to us; related party (including employees') ownership; guarantees and implied relationships.\nIn determining the primary beneficiary, we must make assumptions and estimates about, among other things, the future performance of the underlying assets held by the VIE, including investment returns, cash flows, and credit and interest rate risks. In determining whether a VIE is significant for disclosure purposes, we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary.\nOther VIEs\nFor other sponsored investment funds that do not meet the investment company criteria, such as collateralized debt obligation entities and CLO entities, we determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that potentially could be significant to the VIE. We consider the management fee structure, including the seniority level of our fees, the current and expected economic performance of the entity, as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return.\nIn evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to a VIE, we consider factors regarding the design, terms, and characteristics of the investment vehicles, including the following qualitative factors: if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services; if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle; if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle; if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle; and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is more than insignificant.\nWe must consolidate any VIE for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.\nSee Notes 1, 3, and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of CIVs and other VIEs.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our AUM. The underlying securities within the portfolios we manage, which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements, are generally valued as follows: (i) with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith.\nFor most of our mutual funds and other pooled products, their boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities. Each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which, in turn, may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services, the fund accounting agent, the fund manager, broker-dealers, and others (or a combination thereof). The funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate. Management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition.\nAs manager and advisor for separate accounts, we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts (or may share this responsibility with others) and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition. Management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account AUM. Separate account customers typically select the custodian.\nValuation processes for AUM are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients. Equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales\nprice or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Debt securities under management are usually valued at bid, or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices, provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities. Short-term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. The vast majority of our AUM is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services, fund accounting agents, custodians and brokers. This varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class. Regardless of the valuation process or pricing source, we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided. Where market prices are not readily available, or are determined not to reflect fair value, value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on, among other things, unobservable inputs. Management fees on AUM where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material. As of March 31, 2016, equity, fixed income, and liquidity AUM values aggregated $180.5 billion, $376.8 billion and $112.3 billion, respectively.\nAs the vast majority of our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying the value of our AUM. Economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility; however, the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations. As of March 31, 2016, less than 1% of total AUM is valued based on unobservable inputs. All AUM related to Clarion Partners will be Level 3.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nSubstantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, except a portion of our long-term debt. Trading investments, investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include forms of financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in Net Income (Loss) or Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument.\nFor equity investments where we do not control the investee, and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we follow the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of an investee requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights, any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund's operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity. Our equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee's underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee. Our share of the investee's net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain (loss) on investments within non-operating income (expense).\nFor investments, we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations, when available. Fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices. We evaluate our non-trading investment securities for \"other than temporary\" impairment. Impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time. If an \"other than temporary\" impairment is determined to exist, the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined.\nFor investments in illiquid or privately-held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, excluding investments in CIVs, we owned approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs.\nAt March 31, 2016 and 2015, we also had approximately $45.3 million and $62.9 million, respectively, of other investments, such as investment partnerships, that are included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which approximately $37.3 million and $48.3 million, respectively, are accounted for under the equity method. The remainder is\naccounted for under the cost method, which considers if factors indicate there may be an impairment in the value of these investments. In addition, as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $15.4 million and $16.2 million, respectively, of equity method investments that are included in Investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of non-performance.\nThe accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.\nOur financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\nLevel 1 - Financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets, which, for us, include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or prices are based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such as models or other valuation methodologies. For us, this category may include fixed income securities, certain proprietary fund products, and certain long-term debt.\nLevel 3 - Financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs, including those for which there is little or no market activity. This category includes investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, and private equity funds. This category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions.\nThe valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nProprietary fund products and certain investments held by CIVs are valued at net asset value (\"NAV\") determined by the fund administrator. These funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices. Their valuations may be classified as Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 based on whether the fund is exchange traded, the frequency of the related NAV determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions. For investments in illiquid and privately-held securities (private equity and investment partnerships) for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available, including certain investments held by CIVs, management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources, including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value. These valuation processes for illiquid and privately-held securities inherently require management's judgment and are therefore classified in Level 3.\nFutures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as Level 1.\nAs a practical expedient, we rely on the NAVs of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date.\nAs of March 31, 2016, approximately 1% of total assets (3% of financial assets measured at fair value) and 3% of total liabilities (82% of financial liabilities measured at fair value) meet the definition of Level 3. Excluding the assets and liabilities of CIVs, approximately 1% of total assets (3% of financial assets measured at fair value) and 3% of liabilities (82% of financial liabilities measured at fair value) meet the definition of Level 3.\nAny transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period.\nSee Note 3 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nBalances as of March 31, 2016, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortizable intangible asset management contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indefinite-life intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade names\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,479,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,626,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts, contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds-of-hedge funds, and trade names resulting from acquisitions. Asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract. Contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds-of-hedge funds are indefinite-life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Similarly, trade names are considered indefinite-life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.\nIn allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets, we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows, which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins, growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience and other factors, estimated contract lives, discount rates, projected net client flows and market performance. The determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed. The discount rate employed is a weighted-average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset, as more fully described below.\nGoodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities.\nGiven the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements, on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business or the legal or regulatory environment, loss of key personnel, significant business dispositions, or other events, including changes in economic arrangements with our affiliates that will impact future operating results. If a triggering event has occurred, we perform quantitative tests, which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions, to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired. If we have not qualitatively concluded that it is more likely than not that the respective fair values exceed the related carrying values, we perform these tests for indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill annually at December 31.\nWe completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets as of December 31, 2015. As a result of these impairment tests, our Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts and trade name indefinite-life intangible assets were determined to be partially impaired, resulting in aggregate pre-tax operating charges of $371 million. Neither goodwill nor any other intangible assets were deemed to be impaired. Further, no impairments in the value of amortizable intangible assets were recognized during the year ended March 31, 2016, as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values. We also determined that no triggering events had occurred as of March 31, 2016, therefore, no additional indefinite-life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary. As a result of uncertainty regarding future market conditions, assessing the fair value of the reporting unit and intangible assets requires management to exercise significant judgment. Details of our intangible assets and goodwill and the related impairment tests follow.\nOur acquisition of RARE Infrastructure resulted in the addition of an indefinite-life mutual fund contracts asset, an amortizable separate accounts asset, a trade name asset and goodwill of $123 million, $68 million, $5 million, and $162 million (170 million Australian dollars, 94 million Australian dollars, 7 million Australian dollars, and 225 million Australian dollars), respectively, using the foreign exchange rate as of October 21, 2015. Because the fair values of the RARE Infrastructure indefinite-life mutual fund contracts asset and amortizable separate accounts asset were established as of the October 21, 2015 acquisition date, our December 31, 2015, impairment consideration was limited to a review of AUM trends and other critical valuation inputs, which noted no significant changes.\nAmortizable Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts. Projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current AUM for the applicable contracts. Contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset. The remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates. If the amortization periods are no longer appropriate, the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed. Actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the estimated remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets range from three to 12 years with a weighted-average life of approximately 10.9 years.\nIndefinite-Life Intangible Assets\nFor intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite, fair value is determined from a market participant's perspective based on projected discounted cash flows, taking into account the values market participants would pay in a taxable transaction to acquire the respective assets. We have two primary types of indefinite-life intangible assets: proprietary fund contracts and, to a lesser extent, trade names.\nWe determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows, which take into consideration estimates of future fees, profit margins, growth rates, taxes, and discount rates. The determination of the fair values of our indefinite-life intangible assets is highly dependent on these estimates and changes in these inputs could result in a material impairment of the related carrying values. An asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an Operating expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to exist.\nContracts that are managed and operated as a single unit, such as contracts within the same family of funds, are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions. Similarly, cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset. The Fauchier acquisition completed by Permal in March 2013 included a funds-of-hedge fund business, which was merged with the existing Permal fund business through common management, shared resources (including infrastructure, employees and processes) and co-branding initiatives. Accordingly, the related carrying values and cash flows of these funds have been aggregated for impairment testing.\nProjected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward 40 years, assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance. To estimate the projected cash flows, projected growth rates by affiliate are used to project their AUM. Cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both AUM flows and market expectations by asset class (equity, fixed income and liquidity) and by investment manager based upon, among other things, historical experience and expectations of future market and investment performance from internal and external sources. Currently, our market growth assumptions are 6% for equity, 3% for fixed income, and 0% for liquidity products, with a general assumption of 2% organic growth for all products, subject to exceptions for organic growth (contraction), generally in years one through five.\nThe starting point for these assumptions is our corporate planning process that includes three-year AUM projections from the management of each operating affiliate that consider the specific business circumstances of each affiliate, with flow\nassumptions for certain affiliates adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect a market participant view. Beyond year three, the estimates move towards our general organic growth assumption of 2%, as appropriate for each affiliate and asset class, through year 20. The resulting cash flow growth rate for year 20 is held constant and used to further project cash flows through year 40. Based on projected AUM by affiliate and asset class, affiliate advisory fee rates are applied to determine projected revenues. The domestic mutual fund contracts projected revenues are applied to a weighted-average margin for the applicable affiliates that manage the AUM. Margins are based on arrangements currently in place at each affiliate. Projected operating income is further reduced by an appropriate tax rate to calculate the projected cash flows.\nWe believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs, including internal and external sources, although our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions. Our assumptions are also subject to change due to, among other factors, poor investment performance by one or more of our operating affiliates, the withdrawal of AUM by clients, changes in business climate, adverse regulatory actions, or loss of key personnel. We consider these risks in the development of our growth assumptions and discount rates, discussed further below. Further, actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.\nOur process includes comparison of actual results to prior growth projections. However, differences between actual results and our prior projections are not necessarily indicative of a need to reassess our estimates given that: our discounted projected cash flow analyses include projections well beyond three years and variances in the near-years may be offset in subsequent years; fair value assessments are point-in-time, and the consistency of a fair value assessment with other indicators of value that reflect expectations of market participants at that point-in-time is critical evidence of the soundness of the estimate of value. In subsequent periods, we consider the differences in actual results from our prior projections in considering the reasonableness of the growth assumptions used in our current impairment testing.\nDiscount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and equity capital using a market participant perspective. We estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates. We estimate the cost of equity capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, peer-group betas, and company and equity risk premiums. The equity risk is further adjusted to consider the relative risk associated with each of our indefinite-life intangible asset and our reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values.\nConsistent with standard valuation practices for taxable transactions, the projected discounted cash flow analysis also factors in a tax benefit value, as appropriate. This tax benefit represents the discounted tax savings a third party that purchased an asset on a given valuation date would receive from future tax deductions for the amortization of the purchase price over 15 years.\nThe Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts of $698 million accounted for approximately 20% of our indefinite-life intangible assets, prior to the previously discussed impairment charge, and are supported by the combined funds-of-hedge funds business. These funds have continued to experience periods of moderate inflows or outflows over recent years and certain increased risks, as follows. The past several years have seen declines in the traditional high net worth client funds-of-hedge funds business, Permal's historical focus, which Permal has offset to some extent with inflows in their institutional business. Further, funds-of-hedge fund managers are subject to certain market influences, as evidenced in Permal's growth in institutional funds and separate accounts, adding additional uncertainty to our estimates. Due in part to these factors, actual results for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, generally compared unfavorably to growth assumptions for the Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts used in the asset impairment testing at December 31, 2014. Additionally, the historical Fauchier portion of Permal's business is now subject to risk associated with the loss of certain key staff. As a result, in our December 2015 testing, the growth assumptions for these contracts were reduced in the first five years, which, together with the impact of decreased margins in the first two years, led to decreased projected cash flows from the business. Also, the projected cash flows from the Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts were discounted at 16.5%, compared to 14.5% used in the prior year's impairment testing, reflecting the factors noted above.\nBased upon our projected discounted cash flow analyses, the carrying value of the Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts asset exceeded its fair value of $335 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $364 million for the excess. Cash flows on the Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts are assumed to have an average annual growth rate of approximately 7% (5% market and 2% organic/other). However, given current experience, projected near-year cash flows reflect moderate AUM outflows in years one and two, no net AUM flows in year three, and trend to modest AUM inflows in year four. Investment\nperformance, including its expected impact on future asset flows, is a significant factor in our growth projections for the Permal funds-of-hedge funds contracts. Our market performance projections are supported by the fact that the two largest funds that comprise approximately half of the contracts asset AUM, have 10-year average returns approximating 5%. Our market projections are further supported by industry statistics.\nThe domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the Citigroup Asset Management ( CAM\u201d) transaction of $2.1 billion, account for approximately 70% of our indefinite-life intangible assets. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $150 billion of AUM, primarily managed by ClearBridge and Western Asset, are associated with this asset, with approximately 35% in each of equity and fixed income AUM and 30% in liquidity AUM. Previously disclosed uncertainties regarding market conditions and asset flows and risks related to potential regulatory changes in the liquidity business, are reflected in our projected discounted cash flow analyses. Based on our projected discounted cash flow analyses, the related fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately $1.0 billion. For our impairment test, cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts are assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 6%, and reflect moderate AUM inflows in years 1 and 2. Projected cash flows of the domestic mutual fund contracts are discounted at 13.0%. Results for the 12 months through December 31, 2015, compared favorably to the growth assumptions related to the domestic mutual fund contracts asset impairment testing at December 31, 2014.\nAssuming all other factors remain the same, our actual results and/or changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund contracts cash flow projections over the long-term would have to deviate more than 30% from previous projections, or the discount rate would have to be raised from 13.0% to more than 16.5%, for the asset to be deemed impaired. Despite the higher excess of fair value over the related carrying value, given the current uncertainty regarding future market conditions, it is reasonably possible that fund performance, flows and AUM levels may decrease in the near term such that actual cash flows from the domestic mutual funds contracts could deviate from the projections by more than 30% and the asset could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount.\nTrade names account for 2% of indefinite-life intangible assets and are primarily related to Permal, which had a carrying value of $45 million. We tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite-life contracts. The Permal trade name carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value of $38 million, resulting in a $7 million impairment for the excess. The resulting fair values of the other trade names significantly exceeded the related carrying amounts.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. In estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit, we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows and EBITDA multiples, similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition. We continue to manage our business as one Global Asset Management operating segment. Internal management reporting of discrete financial information regularly received by the chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, is at the consolidated Global Asset Management business level. As a result, goodwill is recorded and evaluated at one Global Asset Management reporting unit level. Our Global Asset Management reporting unit consists of the operating businesses of our asset management affiliates and our centralized global distribution operations. In our impairment testing process, all consolidated assets (except for certain tax benefits) and liabilities are allocated to our single Global Asset Management reporting unit. Similarly, the projected operating results of the reporting unit include our holding company corporate costs and overhead, including costs associated with executive management, finance, human resources, legal and compliance, internal audit and other central corporate functions.\nGoodwill principally originated from the acquisitions of CAM, Permal, Royce, Martin Currie, and more recently RARE Infrastructure. The value of the reporting unit is based in part, on projected consolidated net cash flows, including all cash flows of assets managed in our mutual funds, closed-end funds and other proprietary funds, in addition to separate account assets of our managers.\nSignificant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method are consistent with the methodology discussed above for indefinite-life intangible assets. Also, at the reporting unit level, future corporate costs are estimated and consolidated with the projected operating results of all our affiliates.\nActual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows.\nDiscount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of equity using a market participant perspective, also consistent with the methodology discussed above for indefinite-life intangible assets.\nWe also perform a market-based valuation of our reporting unit value, which applies an average of EBITDA multiples paid in change of control transactions for peer companies to our EBITDA. The results of our two estimates of value for the reporting unit (the discounted cash flow and EBITDA multiple analyses) are compared and any significant differences, if any, are assessed to determine the reasonableness of each value and whether any adjustment to either result is warranted. Once the values are accepted, the appropriately weighted average of the two reporting unit valuations (the discounted cash flow and EBITDA multiple analyses) is used as the implied fair value of our Global Asset Management reporting unit, which at December 31, 2015, exceeded the carrying value by a material amount. Considering the relative merits of the details involved in each valuation process, we used an equal weighting of the two values for the December 2015 testing.\nWe further assess the accuracy of the reporting unit value determined from these valuation methods by comparing their results to our market capitalization to determine an implied control premium. The reasonableness of this implied control premium is considered by comparing it to control premiums that have been paid in relevant actual change of control transactions. This assessment provides evidence that our underlying assumptions in our analyses of our reporting unit fair value are reasonable.\nIn calculating our market capitalization for these purposes, market volatility can have a significant impact on our capitalization, and if appropriate, we may consider the average market prices of our stock for a period of one or two months before the test date to determine market capitalization. A control premium arises from the fact that in an acquisition, there is typically a premium paid over current market prices of publicly traded companies that relates to the ability to control the operations of an acquired company. Further, assessments of control premiums in the asset management industry are difficult because many acquisitions involve privately held companies, or involve only portions of a public company, such that no control premium can be calculated.\nBased on our analysis and consideration, we believe the implied control premium determined by our reporting unit value estimation at December 31, 2015, which is at the lower end of the observed range, is reasonable.\nContingent Consideration Liabilities\nIn connection with business acquisitions, we may be required to pay additional future consideration based on the achievement of certain designated financial metrics. We estimate the fair value of these potential future obligations at the time a business combination is consummated and record a Contingent consideration liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair values of contingent consideration liabilities are revised as of each quarterly reporting date. As of March 31, 2016, the fair values of our contingent consideration liabilities aggregate $84.6 million, relating to our acquisitions of RARE Infrastructure, Martin Currie, QS Investors, and PK Investments. There was no contingent consideration liability associated with the Fauchier acquisition as of March 31, 2016.\nWe estimate the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities using probability-weighted modeling specific to each business acquisition and its arrangement for contingent consideration. Estimated payments are discounted to their present value at the measurement date.\nThe Martin Currie purchase agreement requires us to pay additional consideration based on the achievement of certain financial metrics, as specified in the share purchase agreement, at certain future dates over the three and one-half year earn-out term. Our modeling of the Martin Currie contingent payment arrangement includes Monte Carlo simulation of projected AUM, performance fees and product performance to determine the related estimated payment amounts. If the expected payment amounts subsequently change, the contingent consideration liabilities are (reduced) or increased in the current period, resulting in a (gain) or loss, which is reflected within Other operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Significant increases (decreases) in projected AUM or performance fee levels for Martin Currie would result in significantly higher (lower) contingent consideration liability fair value and the resulting changes could be material to our operating results. The RARE Infrastructure, Fauchier, and QS Investors purchase agreements require us to pay additional consideration based on whether certain future revenue thresholds are achieved. Likewise, significant increases (decreases)\nin projected revenue levels for RARE Infrastructure, Fauchier, and QS Investors would result in significantly higher (lower) contingent consideration liability fair value and the resulting changes could be material to our operating results.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation plans include stock options, an employee stock purchase plan, market-based performance shares payable in common stock, restricted stock awards and units, affiliate management equity plans and deferred compensation payable in stock. Under our stock compensation plans, we issue equity awards to directors, officers, and key employees.\nIn accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, includes compensation cost for all non-vested share-based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight-line method. Also, under the accounting guidance, cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock-based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows.\nWe granted 0.9 million, 0.9 million, and 1.2 million stock options in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. During fiscal 2016, we implemented an affiliate management equity plan with Royce which resulted in the issuance of minority equity interests in the affiliate to its management team. These interests allow the holders to receive quarterly distributions of the affiliate's net revenues in amounts equal to the percentage of ownership represented by the equity they hold. During fiscal 2014, we also implemented management equity plans for Permal and ClearBridge and granted units to certain of their employees that entitle them to participate in 15% of the future growth of the respective affiliate's enterprise value (subject to appropriate discounts). For additional information on share-based compensation, see Notes 1 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, except for market-based grants, for which we use a Monte Carlo option-pricing model. Both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables. The inputs for the Black-Scholes model include: stock price on the date of grant, exercise price of the option, dividend yield, volatility, expected life and the risk-free interest rate, all of which, with the exception of the grant date stock price and the exercise price, require estimates or assumptions. We calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the expected life of the options. We estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant. The expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled, based upon our historical option exercise experience. The risk-free interest rate is the rate available for zero-coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued. If we used different methods to estimate our variables for the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models, or if we used a different type of option-pricing model, the fair value of our option grants might be different.\nWe also determine the fair value of option-like affiliate management equity plan grants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, subject to any post-vesting illiquidity discounts. Inputs to the Black-Scholes model are generally determined in a fashion similar to the fair value of grants of options in our own stock, described above. However, because our affiliates are private companies without quoted stock prices, we utilize discounted cash flow analyses and market-based valuations, similar to those discussed above under the heading Intangible Assets and Goodwill\u201d, to determine the respective business enterprise values, subject to appropriate discounts for lack of control and marketability.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests include affiliate minority interests, third-party investor equity in consolidated sponsored investment vehicles, and vested management equity plan interests. Noncontrolling interests where the holder may be able to request settlement are classified as redeemable, and are reported at their estimated settlement values. When settlement is not expected to occur until a future date, changes in the expected settlement value are recognized over the settlement period. Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests do not permit the holder to request settlement, and are reported at their issuance value, together with undistributed net income allocated to noncontrolling interests.\nWe estimate the settlement value of noncontrolling interests as their fair value. For consolidated sponsored investment vehicles, where the investor may request withdrawal at any time, fair value is based on market quotes of the underlying securities held by the investment vehicles. For affiliate minority interests and management equity plan interests, fair value reflects the related total business enterprise value, after appropriate discounts for lack of marketability and control. There\nmay also be features of these equity interests, such as dividend subordination, that are contemplated in their valuations. The fair value of option-like management equity plan interests also relies on Black-Scholes option pricing model calculations, as noted above.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the federal, state and local jurisdictions of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction. Due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes.\nThese estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes. Management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. If it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision.\nAs a result of the prospective application of new accounting guidance, we have offset all deferred tax assets, liabilities, and any related valuation allowances, and present them as a single non-current amount as of March 31, 2016. We have not retrospectively adjusted prior periods.\nSubstantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. federal and state, and U.K. taxing jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2016, U.S. federal deferred tax assets aggregated $711.5 million, realization of which is expected to require $3.2 billion of future U.S. earnings, of which $740 million must be foreign sourced earnings. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. Based on estimates of future taxable income, using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing, it is more likely than not that substantially all of the current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable. With respect to those resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards, it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to the utilization of approximately $23.5 million of foreign taxes as credits will not be realized and a valuation allowance has been established. Further, our estimates and assumptions do not contemplate certain possible future changes in the ownership of Legg Mason stock, which, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, could limit our utilization of net operating loss and foreign tax credit benefits.\nAs of March 31, 2016, federal valuation allowances aggregated $21.0 million. The decrease in federal valuation allowances from the prior year relates to $12.7 million of expiring foreign tax credits. The release was offset in part by $6.9 million, of which $2.5 million relates to foreign tax credits, $3.4 million relates to charitable contributions, and $1.0 million relates to Martin Currie's operating losses.\nWhile tax planning may enhance our tax positions, the realization of tax benefits on deferred tax assets for which valuation allowances have not been provided is not dependent on implementation of any significant tax strategies.\nAs of March 31, 2016, U.S. state deferred tax assets aggregated $175.7 million. Due to limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and taking into consideration state tax planning strategies, the related valuation allowance was $26.8 million, substantially all of which relates to prior years for state net operating loss benefits generated in certain jurisdictions in cases where it is more likely that these benefits will not ultimately be realized. Due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates, the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary.\nFor foreign jurisdictions, a decrease in valuation allowances of $11.4 million in fiscal 2016 primarily relates to the change in statutory rates, tax planning to utilize attributes previously considered realizable, and adjustments to intercompany pricing models.\nTo the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities, we have considered the timing, nature and jurisdiction of reversals, as well as, future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets. In the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable, we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the\nincome tax provision in the period in which that determination is made. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the charge could be material to our earnings.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nSee discussion of Recent Accounting Developments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nThe rate of inflation can directly affect various expenses, including employee compensation, communications and technology and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nLegg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise \"Legg Mason\") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company-sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the U.S. and the U.K. and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. All references to fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014, refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" and \"Company\" refer to Legg Mason.\nOur operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks or hurdle rates. The largest portion of our performance fees is earned based on 12-month performance periods that end in differing quarters during the year, with a portion based on quarterly performance periods. Distribution and service fees are received for distributing investment products and services, for providing other support services to investment portfolios, or for providing non-discretionary advisory services, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management (\"AUM\") and assets under advisement (\"AUA\") and fee rates, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain AUM and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our AUM varies in large part from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets as well as market performance and changes in foreign exchange rates. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance (both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products) of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential client's situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions.\nThe fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of AUM, the asset management affiliate that provides the services, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income or liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues and average operating revenue yields will be affected by the composition of our AUM, with changes in the relative level of equity assets and alternatives typically more significantly impacting our revenues and average operating revenue yields. Average operating revenue yields are calculated as the ratio of annualized investment advisory fees, distribution and service fees, and other revenues, less performance fees, to average AUM. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. We have revenue sharing arrangements in place for most of our asset management affiliates, under which specified percentages of the affiliates' revenues are required to be distributed to us and the balance of the revenues is retained by the affiliates to pay their operating expenses, including compensation expenses, but excluding certain expenses and income taxes. Under these arrangements, our asset management affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs. As such, our Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates and products generate our AUM, and a change in AUM at one affiliate or with respect to one product or class of products can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another affiliate or in another product or class of products. In addition, from time to time, we may agree to changes in revenue sharing and other arrangements with our asset management personnel, which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability.\nThe most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels, non-compensation related operating expense levels at revenue share-based affiliates, and our overall profitability. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing expense, which consists primarily of fees paid to third-party distributors for selling\nour asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are typically consistent from period to period, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity.\nOur financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of global financial markets. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our AUM, and the volatility and general level of securities prices, and interest rates, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, among other things. Periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to have an adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attraction and retention of key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in the attraction and retention of clients. In the last few years, the industry has seen flows into products for which we do not currently garner significant market share. For a further discussion of factors that may affect our results of operations, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors included herein.\nThe financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, commercial banks, insurance companies and other financial services companies. The industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty, the constant introduction of new products and services, and the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been and will continue to be impacted by regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes and keeping abreast of regulatory developments, has required, and will continue to require, us to incur costs that impact our profitability.\nOur strategic priorities are focused on four primary areas listed below. Management keeps these strategic priorities in mind when it evaluates our operating performance and financial condition. Consistent with this approach, we have also presented in the table below the most important initiatives on which management currently focuses in evaluating our performance and financial condition.\n\nThe strategic priorities discussed above are designed to drive improvements in our net flows, earnings, cash flows, AUM and other key metrics, including operating margin. Certain of these key metrics are discussed in our annual results discussion to follow.\nIn connection with these strategic priorities (principally products and productivity):\n \u2022 On May 2, 2016, we completed the transaction to combine The Permal Group, Limited (\"Permal\"), our existing hedge fund platform, with EnTrust Capital (\"EnTrust\"). EnTrust is a leading alternative asset management firm headquartered in New York with approximately $10 billion in AUM and $2 billion in AUA and committed capital. We own 65% of the combined entity, which is branded EnTrustPermal. \nThe combination of the businesses of EnTrust and Permal creates a new global alternatives firm with over $26 billion in AUM and total client assets (including AUA and committed capital) of approximately $30 billion. In connection with the restructuring of Permal for the combination with EnTrust, we expect to incur up to $100 million of total restructuring and transition-related costs, of which $43.3 million was incurred during the year ended March 31, 2016. Approximately $40 million to $50 million of the anticipated remaining costs associated with the restructuring are expected to be incurred in the year ending March 31, 2017. We expect to achieve approximately $35 million in annual savings from the cost structures of the two businesses. See Notes 2 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n \u2022 On April 13, 2016, we acquired an 82% majority equity interest in Clarion Partners, a diversified real estate asset management firm based in New York. Clarion Partners managed approximately $41.5 billion in AUM as of April 30, 2016. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 In March 2016, we completed the implementation of a management equity plan with the management of Royce & Associates (\"Royce\"). We incurred a non-cash charge of $21.4 million upon the issuance of management equity plan units in fiscal 2016. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Royce management equity plan. \n \u2022 In March 2016, we issued $450 million of Senior Notes due 2026, and $250 million of Junior Subordinated Notes due 2056, the net proceeds of which were used to finance the acquisitions of EnTrust and Clarion Partners. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 On January 22, 2016, we acquired a 20% minority equity position in Precidian Investments, LLC (\"Precidian\"), a firm specializing in creating innovative products and solutions and solving market structure issues, particularly with regard to the exchange-traded fund (\"ETF\") marketplace. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 In December 2015, we launched four new ETF products on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. These outcome-oriented index-based ETF funds are managed by our wholly-owned asset management affiliate QS Investors Holdings, LLC (\"QS Investors\"). \n \u2022 On October 21, 2015, we acquired a 75% majority interest in RARE Infrastructure Limited (\"RARE Infrastructure\"). RARE Infrastructure specializes in global listed infrastructure investing, is headquartered in Sydney, Australia, and had approximately $6.8 billion in AUM at closing. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nNet Loss Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2016, was $25.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, as compared to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. of $237.1 million, or $2.04 per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2015. In addition to the $43.3 million of expenses related to the restructuring of Permal for the combination with EnTrust and the $21.4 million charge related to the Royce management equity plan, as discussed above, the year ended March 31, 2016, included pre-tax impairment charges of $371.0 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, related to Permal indefinite-life intangible assets, inclusive of the related intangible asset from Fauchier Partners Management Limited (\"Fauchier\"). The year ended March 31, 2015, included a pre-tax, non-operating charge of $107.1 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, related to the refinancing of our previously outstanding 5.5% Senior Notes, as well as $35.8 million in expenses related to the integration of two of our existing affiliates, Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. (\"Batterymarch\") and Legg Mason Global Asset Management, LLC (\"LMGAA\") into QS Investors. Average AUM and total revenues decreased in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, as further discussed below.\nTotal AUM decreased during the year ended March 31, 2016, due to the negative impact of market performance and other and net client outflows in both long-term and liquidity AUM, which were offset in part by the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure in October 2015.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides additional information regarding our financial condition and results of operations.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDuring fiscal 2016, while the U.S. economic environment was characterized by continued growth and improving fundamentals, the business environment was strongly influenced by overall markets, which remained sensitive to increasing concerns over economic and political conditions in other countries, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's decision to increase the target federal funds rate in December 2015 for the first time since 2006.\nBoth U.S. and international equity markets experienced significant volatility during fiscal 2016. Despite recovering a significant portion of the losses experienced as a result of this volatility, all three major U.S. equity market indices decreased during fiscal 2016, after increasing for the past two fiscal years, while bond indices were mixed, as illustrated in the table below:\n\n (1) Indices are trademarks of Dow Jones & Company, McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., and Barclays Capital, respectively, which are not affiliated with Legg Mason. \n (2) Excludes the impact of the reinvestment of dividends and stock splits. \nIn December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board increased the target federal funds rate for the first time since 2006, from 0.25% to 0.50%. While the economic outlook for the U.S. has remained more positive in recent years, the financial environment in which we operate continues to reflect a heightened level of sensitivity as we move into fiscal 2017.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as a percentage of operating revenues and the increase (decrease) by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period:\n\nn/m-not meaningful\n (1) Calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount. \nASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND ASSETS UNDER ADVISEMENT\nAssets Under Management\nOur AUM is primarily managed across the following asset classes:\n\nThe components of the changes in our AUM (in billions) for the years ended March 31, were as follows:\n\n (1) Subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes. \n (2) Other is primarily the reclassification of $0.5 billion and $12.8 billion of client assets from AUM to AUA for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the reinvestment of dividends. \n (3) Includes $6.8 billion related to the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure and $0.1 billion related to the acquisition of PK Investments, LLP (\"PK Investments\") during the year ended March 31, 2016; and $9.5 billion related to the acquisition of Martin Currie (Holdings) Limited (\"Martin Currie\") and $5.0 billion related to the acquisition of QS Investors, offset in part by $9.5 billion related to the disposition of Legg Mason Investments Counsel and Trust (\"LMIC\"), for the year ended March 31, 2015. \nAUM at March 31, 2016, was $669.6 billion, a decrease of $33.1 billion, or 4.7%, from March 31, 2015. Total net client outflows were $26.1 billion, consisting of net client outflows from the liquidity and long-term asset classes of $14.9 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively. Net long-term asset outflows were comprised of equity and fixed income net outflows of $10.8 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. Equity net outflows were primarily in products managed by Royce, for which outflows are expected to continue for the near-term, and ClearBridge Investments, LLC ( ClearBridge\u201d), offset in part by equity net inflows at QS Investors. Fixed income net outflows were primarily in products managed by Western Asset Management Company (\"Western Asset\") and Permal, offset in part by fixed income net inflows at Brandywine Global\nInvestment Management, LLC (\"Brandywine\"). We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in the equity asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. than would outflows in other asset classes. Market performance and other was $(15.3) billion and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was $1.4 billion. Acquisitions of $6.9 billion primarily relate to the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure in October 2015.\nAUM at March 31, 2015, was $702.7 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion, or 0.1%, from March 31, 2014. Total net client outflows were $5.7 billion, as net client outflows of $22.2 billion from the liquidity asset class were substantially offset by $16.5 billion of net client inflows into long-term asset classes. In fiscal 2015, we experienced net inflows into long-term asset classes for the only time since fiscal 2007. Net long-term asset inflows were comprised of fixed income net inflows of $19.2 billion offset in part by equity net outflows of $2.7 billion. Fixed income net inflows were primarily in products managed by Brandywine and Western Asset. Equity net outflows were primarily in products managed by Royce and QS Investors and were partially offset by equity inflows at ClearBridge and Brandywine. Market performance and other totaled $20.1 billion, as the positive impact of market performance and other of $32.9 billion was offset in part by the reclassification of $12.8 billion of client assets from AUM to AUA in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as further discussed below. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was $(18.5) billion. Acquisitions (dispositions), net, totaled $5.0 billion, with $9.5 billion related to the acquisition of Martin Currie and $5.0 billion related to the acquisition of QS Investors, offset in part by $9.5 billion related to the disposition of LMIC.\nOur investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third-party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance.\nAUM by Asset Class\nAUM by asset class (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows:\n\nAverage AUM by asset class (in billions) for the years ended March 31 were as follows:\n\nThe component changes in our AUM by asset class (in billions) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were as follows:\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nLegg Mason, Inc., a holding company, with its subsidiaries (which collectively comprise \"Legg Mason\") is a global asset management firm. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company-sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We have operations principally in the U.S. and the U.K. and also have offices in Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dubai, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. All references to fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014, refer to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. Terms such as \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" and \"Company\" refer to Legg Mason.\nOur operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees from separate accounts and funds, and distribution and service fees. Investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage. In addition, performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks or hurdle rates. The largest portion of our performance fees is earned based on 12-month performance periods that end in differing quarters during the year, with a portion based on quarterly performance periods. Distribution and service fees are received for distributing investment products and services, for providing other support services to investment portfolios, or for providing non-discretionary advisory services, and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio. Our revenues, therefore, are dependent upon the level of our assets under management (\"AUM\") and assets under advisement (\"AUA\") and fee rates, and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions, our ability to attract and maintain AUM and key investment personnel, and investment performance. Our AUM varies in large part from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets as well as market performance and changes in foreign exchange rates. Client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management, and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services, may be based on one or more of a number of factors. These factors include our reputation in the marketplace, the investment performance (both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products) of our products and services, the fees we charge for our investment services, the client or potential client's situation, including investment objectives, liquidity needs, investment horizon and amount of assets managed, our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment, including market conditions.\nThe fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product, the amount of AUM, the asset management affiliate that provides the services, and the type of services (and investment objectives) that are provided. Fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income or liquidity asset management services. Accordingly, our revenues and average operating revenue yields will be affected by the composition of our AUM, with changes in the relative level of equity assets and alternatives typically more significantly impacting our revenues and average operating revenue yields. Average operating revenue yields are calculated as the ratio of annualized investment advisory fees, distribution and service fees, and other revenues, less performance fees, to average AUM. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. We have revenue sharing arrangements in place for most of our asset management affiliates, under which specified percentages of the affiliates' revenues are required to be distributed to us and the balance of the revenues is retained by the affiliates to pay their operating expenses, including compensation expenses, but excluding certain expenses and income taxes. Under these arrangements, our asset management affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs. As such, our Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc., operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates and products generate our AUM, and a change in AUM at one affiliate or with respect to one product or class of products can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another affiliate or in another product or class of products. In addition, from time to time, we may agree to changes in revenue sharing and other arrangements with our asset management personnel, which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability.\nThe most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits, of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels, non-compensation related operating expense levels at revenue share-based affiliates, and our overall profitability. The next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing expense, which consists primarily of fees paid to third-party distributors for selling\nour asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature. Certain other operating costs are typically consistent from period to period, such as occupancy, depreciation and amortization, and fixed contract commitments for market data, communication and technology services, and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or, conversely, usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity.\nOur financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of global financial markets. Results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results. Our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the amount and composition of our AUM, and the volatility and general level of securities prices, and interest rates, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, among other things. Periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to have an adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, the diversification of services and products offered, investment performance, access to distribution channels, reputation in the market, attraction and retention of key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in the attraction and retention of clients. In the last few years, the industry has seen flows into products for which we do not currently garner significant market share. For a further discussion of factors that may affect our results of operations, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors included herein.\nThe financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive. Our competition includes numerous global, national, regional and local asset management firms, commercial banks, insurance companies and other financial services companies. The industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty, the constant introduction of new products and services, and the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. The industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws. Like most firms, we have been and will continue to be impacted by regulatory and legislative changes. Responding to these changes and keeping abreast of regulatory developments, has required, and will continue to require, us to incur costs that impact our profitability.\nOur strategic priorities are focused on four primary areas listed below. Management keeps these strategic priorities in mind when it evaluates our operating performance and financial condition. Consistent with this approach, we have also presented in the table below the most important initiatives on which management currently focuses in evaluating our performance and financial condition.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Strategic Priorities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Initiatives\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Create an innovative portfolio of investment products and promote revenue growth by developing new products and leveraging the capabilities of our affiliates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Identify and execute strategic acquisitions to increase product offerings, strengthen our affiliates, and fill gaps in products and services\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Performance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Deliver compelling and consistent performance against both relevant benchmarks and the products and services of our competitors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Evaluate and reallocate resources within and to our distribution platform to continue to maintain and enhance our leading distribution function with the capability to offer solutions to relevant investment challenges and grow market share worldwide\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Productivity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Operate with a high level of effectiveness and improve ongoing efficiency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Manage expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u009f\n</td> <td>Align economic relationships with affiliate management teams, including retained affiliate management equity and the implementation of affiliate management equity plan agreements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe strategic priorities discussed above are designed to drive improvements in our net flows, earnings, cash flows, AUM and other key metrics, including operating margin. Certain of these key metrics are discussed in our annual results discussion to follow.\nIn connection with these strategic priorities (principally products and productivity):\n \u2022 On May 2, 2016, we completed the transaction to combine The Permal Group, Limited (\"Permal\"), our existing hedge fund platform, with EnTrust Capital (\"EnTrust\"). EnTrust is a leading alternative asset management firm headquartered in New York with approximately $10 billion in AUM and $2 billion in AUA and committed capital. We own 65% of the combined entity, which is branded EnTrustPermal. \nThe combination of the businesses of EnTrust and Permal creates a new global alternatives firm with over $26 billion in AUM and total client assets (including AUA and committed capital) of approximately $30 billion. In connection with the restructuring of Permal for the combination with EnTrust, we expect to incur up to $100 million of total restructuring and transition-related costs, of which $43.3 million was incurred during the year ended March 31, 2016. Approximately $40 million to $50 million of the anticipated remaining costs associated with the restructuring are expected to be incurred in the year ending March 31, 2017. We expect to achieve approximately $35 million in annual savings from the cost structures of the two businesses. See Notes 2 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n \u2022 On April 13, 2016, we acquired an 82% majority equity interest in Clarion Partners, a diversified real estate asset management firm based in New York. Clarion Partners managed approximately $41.5 billion in AUM as of April 30, 2016. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 In March 2016, we completed the implementation of a management equity plan with the management of Royce & Associates (\"Royce\"). We incurred a non-cash charge of $21.4 million upon the issuance of management equity plan units in fiscal 2016. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Royce management equity plan. \n \u2022 In March 2016, we issued $450 million of Senior Notes due 2026, and $250 million of Junior Subordinated Notes due 2056, the net proceeds of which were used to finance the acquisitions of EnTrust and Clarion Partners. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 On January 22, 2016, we acquired a 20% minority equity position in Precidian Investments, LLC (\"Precidian\"), a firm specializing in creating innovative products and solutions and solving market structure issues, particularly with regard to the exchange-traded fund (\"ETF\") marketplace. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 In December 2015, we launched four new ETF products on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. These outcome-oriented index-based ETF funds are managed by our wholly-owned asset management affiliate QS Investors Holdings, LLC (\"QS Investors\"). \n \u2022 On October 21, 2015, we acquired a 75% majority interest in RARE Infrastructure Limited (\"RARE Infrastructure\"). RARE Infrastructure specializes in global listed infrastructure investing, is headquartered in Sydney, Australia, and had approximately $6.8 billion in AUM at closing. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nNet Loss Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2016, was $25.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, as compared to Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. of $237.1 million, or $2.04 per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2015. In addition to the $43.3 million of expenses related to the restructuring of Permal for the combination with EnTrust and the $21.4 million charge related to the Royce management equity plan, as discussed above, the year ended March 31, 2016, included pre-tax impairment charges of $371.0 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, related to Permal indefinite-life intangible assets, inclusive of the related intangible asset from Fauchier Partners Management Limited (\"Fauchier\"). The year ended March 31, 2015, included a pre-tax, non-operating charge of $107.1 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, related to the refinancing of our previously outstanding 5.5% Senior Notes, as well as $35.8 million in expenses related to the integration of two of our existing affiliates, Batterymarch Financial Management, Inc. (\"Batterymarch\") and Legg Mason Global Asset Management, LLC (\"LMGAA\") into QS Investors. Average AUM and total revenues decreased in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, as further discussed below.\nTotal AUM decreased during the year ended March 31, 2016, due to the negative impact of market performance and other and net client outflows in both long-term and liquidity AUM, which were offset in part by the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure in October 2015.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides additional information regarding our financial condition and results of operations.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDuring fiscal 2016, while the U.S. economic environment was characterized by continued growth and improving fundamentals, the business environment was strongly influenced by overall markets, which remained sensitive to increasing concerns over economic and political conditions in other countries, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's decision to increase the target federal funds rate in December 2015 for the first time since 2006.\nBoth U.S. and international equity markets experienced significant volatility during fiscal 2016. Despite recovering a significant portion of the losses experienced as a result of this volatility, all three major U.S. equity market indices decreased during fiscal 2016, after increasing for the past two fiscal years, while bond indices were mixed, as illustrated in the table below:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change for the year ended March 31:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indices(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dow Jones Industrial Average(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P 500(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NASDAQ Composite Index(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Indices are trademarks of Dow Jones & Company, McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., and Barclays Capital, respectively, which are not affiliated with Legg Mason. \n (2) Excludes the impact of the reinvestment of dividends and stock splits. \nIn December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board increased the target federal funds rate for the first time since 2006, from 0.25% to 0.50%.

classes. \n (2) Other is primarily the reclassification of $0.5 billion and $12.8 billion of client assets from AUM to AUA for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the reinvestment of dividends. \n (3) Includes $6.8 billion related to the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure and $0.1 billion related to the acquisition of PK Investments, LLP (\"PK Investments\") during the year ended March 31, 2016; and $9.5 billion related to the acquisition of Martin Currie (Holdings) Limited (\"Martin Currie\") and $5.0 billion related to the acquisition of QS Investors, offset in part by $9.5 billion related to the disposition of Legg Mason Investments Counsel and Trust (\"LMIC\"), for the year ended March 31, 2015. \nAUM at March 31, 2016, was $669.6 billion, a decrease of $33.1 billion, or 4.7%, from March 31, 2015. Total net client outflows were $26.1 billion, consisting of net client outflows from the liquidity and long-term asset classes of $14.9 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively. Net long-term asset outflows were comprised of equity and fixed income net outflows of $10.8 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. Equity net outflows were primarily in products managed by Royce, for which outflows are expected to continue for the near-term, and ClearBridge Investments, LLC ( ClearBridge\u201d), offset in part by equity net inflows at QS Investors. Fixed income net outflows were primarily in products managed by Western Asset Management Company (\"Western Asset\") and Permal, offset in part by fixed income net inflows at Brandywine Global\nInvestment Management, LLC (\"Brandywine\"). We generally earn higher fees and profits on equity AUM, and outflows in the equity asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. than would outflows in other asset classes. Market performance and other was $(15.3) billion and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was $1.4 billion. Acquisitions of $6.9 billion primarily relate to the acquisition of RARE Infrastructure in October 2015.\nAUM at March 31, 2015, was $702.7 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion, or 0.1%, from March 31, 2014. Total net client outflows were $5.7 billion, as net client outflows of $22.2 billion from the liquidity asset class were substantially offset by $16.5 billion of net client inflows into long-term asset classes. In fiscal 2015, we experienced net inflows into long-term asset classes for the only time since fiscal 2007. Net long-term asset inflows were comprised of fixed income net inflows of $19.2 billion offset in part by equity net outflows of $2.7 billion. Fixed income net inflows were primarily in products managed by Brandywine and Western Asset. Equity net outflows were primarily in products managed by Royce and QS Investors and were partially offset by equity inflows at ClearBridge and Brandywine. Market performance and other totaled $20.1 billion, as the positive impact of market performance and other of $32.9 billion was offset in part by the reclassification of $12.8 billion of client assets from AUM to AUA in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as further discussed below. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was $(18.5) billion. Acquisitions (dispositions), net, totaled $5.0 billion, with $9.5 billion related to the acquisition of Martin Currie and $5.0 billion related to the acquisition of QS Investors, offset in part by $9.5 billion related to the disposition of LMIC.\nOur investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice.
