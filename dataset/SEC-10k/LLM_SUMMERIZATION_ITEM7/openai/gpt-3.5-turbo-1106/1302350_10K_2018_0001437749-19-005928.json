In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.\nImpact of Adopting Revenue Recognition Guidance\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, and clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The Company adopted this standard using a modified retrospective approach and the new revenue standard was applied prospectively in the Company's financial statements. The Company reported financial information for historical comparable periods that was not revised and will continue to report those historical periods under the accounting standards that were in effect then. The new standard does not apply to revenue from financial instruments, including loans and securities, and as a result, it did not have an impact on revenues closely associated with financial instruments, including principal transactions, interest income, and interest expenses. The new standard primarily impacts the presentation of our investment banking revenues, specifically underwriting revenues, strategic advisory revenues, and private placement fees. Certain investment banking revenues have historically been presented net of related expenses. Under the new standard, revenues and expenses related to investment banking transactions are presented gross in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For investment banking and asset management revenues, the Company has separately described the accounting policies in effect during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For additional information, see Note 3.\nThe Election for JMP Group LLC to be Taxed as a Corporation\nSince January 2015, JMP Group LLC has been a publicly traded partnership and, as such, has been taxed as a partnership, and not as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income.\u201d On January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than a partnership, going forward. The Company expects this election will be retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019. As a partnership, the Company has previously been treated as a disregarded entity for tax purposes and has only paid taxes on a few taxable corporate holding subsidiaries.\nAn entity taxed as a partnership generally does not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability, and any income, gains, losses or deductions are taken in by the owners of the partnership in computing their U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of any distributions from the partnership. In contrast, an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally pays U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income as it is considered a taxable entity. For years beginning after December 31, 2017, the maximum U.S. federal tax rate imposed on the net income of corporations is 21%. This rate may be subject to change in the future. Owners of a corporate entity generally do not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability on any earnings of the corporation unless the corporation makes a distribution of cash or property. Any distributions paid from current or accumulated earnings are treated as dividends, and these \"qualifying dividends\" are generally taxed at a lower rate than the ordinary income tax rate. Any distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings are treated as nontaxable returns of capital which reduce the owner's tax basis in the corporation. Any remaining excess is treated as capital gain. For corporate entities, as both the corporation and distributions from the corporation are taxed, there are two levels of potential tax on the income earned.\nOverview\nThe Company, is a diversified capital markets firm headquartered in San Francisco, California. We have a diversified business model with a focus on small and middle-market companies and provide:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> investment banking services, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and other strategic advisory services, to corporate clients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> sales and trading and related securities brokerage services to institutional investors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> equity research coverage of four target industries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> asset management products and services to institutional investors, high net-worth individuals and for our own account; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> management of collateralized loan obligations and a specialty finance company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Revenues\nWe derive revenues primarily from: fees from our investment banking business, net commissions from our sales and trading business, management fees and incentive fees from our asset management business, and interest income earned on collateralized loan obligations we manage. We also generate revenues from principal transactions, interest, dividends and other income.\nInvestment Banking\nWe earn investment banking revenues from underwriting securities offerings, arranging private capital markets transactions and providing advisory services in mergers and acquisitions and other strategic transactions.\nUnderwriting Revenues\nWe earn revenues from securities offerings in which we act as an underwriter, such as initial public offerings and follow-on equity offerings. Underwriting revenues include management fees, underwriting fees, selling concessions, and realized and unrealized net gains and losses on equity positions held in inventory for a period of time to facilitate the completion of certain underwritten offerings. We record underwriting revenues, gross of related syndicate expenses, on the trade date which is typically the date of pricing an offering (or the following day). The Company has determined that its performance obligations are completed and the related income is reasonably determinable on the trade date. In syndicated transactions, management estimates our share of transaction-related expenses incurred by the syndicate, and we recognize revenues gross of such expense. On final settlement by the lead manager, typically 90 days from the trade date of the transaction, we adjust these amounts to reflect the actual transaction-related expenses and our resulting underwriting fee. We receive a higher proportion of total fees in underwritten transactions in which we act as a lead manager.\nStrategic Advisory Revenues\nOur strategic advisory revenues primarily consist of success fees received upon the closing of mergers and acquisitions but also include retainer fees received when we are first engaged to provide advisory services. We also earn fees for related advisory work and other services, such as fairness opinions, valuation analyses, due diligence, and pre-transaction structuring advice. These revenues may be earned for providing services to either the buyer or the seller involved in a transaction. Depending on the nature of the engagement letter and the agreed upon services, customers may simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of services or services may culminate in the delivery of the advisory services at a point in time. The Company evaluates each contract individually and the performance obligations identified to determine if revenue should be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement or at a specific point in time. Any retainer fees received in connection with these agreements are individually evaluated and any unearned fees are deferred for revenue recognition.\nPrivate Capital Markets and Other Revenues\nWe earn fees for private capital markets and other services in connection with transactions that are not underwritten, such as private placements of equity securities, private investments in public equity ( PIPE\u201d) transactions and Rule 144A offerings. We record private placement revenues on the closing date of these transactions. Client reimbursements for costs associated for private placement fees are recorded gross within Investment banking and various expense captions, excluding compensation.\nSince our investment banking revenues are generally recognized at the time of completion of a transaction or the services to be performed, these revenues typically vary between periods and may be affected considerably by the timing of the closing of significant transactions.\nBrokerage Revenues\nOur brokerage revenues include trading commissions paid by customers for purchases or sales of exchange-listed and over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) equity securities. Commissions resulting from equity securities transactions executed on behalf of customers are recorded on a trade date basis. The Company believes that the performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer. Brokerage revenues also include net trading gains and losses that result from market-making activities and from our commitment of capital to facilitate customer transactions. Our brokerage revenues may vary between periods, in part depending on commission rates, trading volumes and our ability to deliver equity research and other value-added services to our clients. The ability to execute trades electronically, through the Internet and through other alternative trading systems, has increased pressure on trading commissions and spreads across our industry. We expect this trend toward alternative trading systems and the related pricing pressure in the brokerage business to continue. We are, to some extent, compensated through brokerage commissions for the equity research and other value-added services we deliver to our clients. These soft dollar\u201d practices have been the subject of discussion among regulators, the investment banking community and our sales and trading clients. In particular, commission sharing arrangements have been adopted by some large institutional investors. In these arrangements, an institutional investor concentrates its trading with fewer execution\u201d brokers and pays a fixed amount for execution, with a designated amount set aside for payments to other firms for research or other brokerage services. Accordingly, trading volume directed to us by investors that enter into such arrangements may be reduced, or eliminated, but we may be compensated for our research and sales efforts through allocations of the designated amounts. Depending on the extent to which we agree to this practice and depending on our ability to enter into arrangements on terms acceptable to us, this trend would likely impair the revenues and profitability of our brokerage business by negatively affecting both volumes and trading commissions.\nAsset Management Fees\nWe earn asset management fees for managing a family of investment partnerships, including hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, and private equity funds, a real estate fund, a capital debt fund, as well as a publicly traded specialty finance company, HCC. These fees include base management fees and incentive fees. Base management fees are generally determined by the fair value of the assets under management (\"AUM\") or the aggregate capital commitment and the fee schedule for each fund or account. Incentive fees are based upon the investment performance of the funds or accounts. For most of our funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the excess investment return above a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined period of time. For private equity funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the realized gain from the disposition of each portfolio investment in which each investor participates, which we earn after returning contributions by an investor for a portfolio investment. Some of these incentive fees are subject to contingent repayments to investors or clawback and cannot be recognized until it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. Any such fees earned are deferred for revenue recognition until the contingency is removed or the Company determines that it is not probable that a significant reversal of revenue will occur. Generally, we do not earn management fees calculated on the basis of average AUM.\nAs of December 31, 2018 the contractual base management fees earned from each of our investment funds or companies ranged between 1% and 2% of AUM or were between 1% and 2% of aggregate committed capital. The contractual incentive fees were generally 20%, subject to high-water marks, for the hedge funds; 5% to 20%, subject to high-water marks or a performance hurdle rate, for the hedge funds of funds; 20%, subject to high-water marks, for Harvest Growth Capital LLC ( HGC\u201d) and Harvest Growth Capital II LLC ( HGC II\u201d); and 30% for JMP Capital I LLC (\"JMP Capital I\"). Our asset management revenues are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors that are unpredictable, including the overall condition of the economy, the securities markets as a whole and our core sectors. These market and industry conditions can have a material effect on the inflows and outflows of AUM and on the performance of our asset management funds. For example, a significant portion of the performance-based or incentive fee revenues that we recognize are based on the value of securities held in the funds we manage. The value of these securities includes unrealized gains or losses that may change from one period to another.\nThe Company sold the general partnership interest in the Harvest Small Cap Partners (\"HSCP\") fund entities to a newly formed entity owned by the portfolio manager of the HSCP funds. The sale closed on December 31, 2018 upon which the Company's investment management contracts with the HSCP funds terminated. As a result, the Company's AUM decreased by $365.7 million on January 1, 2019. As part of the sale, the Company will receive contingent revenue generated by these funds over the next five years, subject to a limit on the total contingent revenue. These trailer fees will be recognized as other income.\nAsset management fees for the CLOs we manage currently consist only of senior and subordinated base management fees. We recognize base management fees for the CLOs on a monthly basis over the period during which the collateral management services are performed. The base management fees for the CLOs are calculated as a percentage of the average aggregate collateral balances for a specified period. As we consolidate the CLO's, the management fees earned at JMPCA are eliminated on consolidation in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO I and CLO II were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO III were 0.35% and 0.33%, respectively, of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO IV warehouse portfolio were 1.0% of the average collateral balance. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO IV, after securitization, were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO V warehouse portfolio were 1.0% of the average equity contributions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO V, after securitization, were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO VI warehouse portfolio were 1.0% of the average equity contributions.\nThe redemption provisions of our hedge funds require at least 60 to 90 days' advance notice. Redemptions are not permitted in our private equity funds or our private debt capital vehicles. The redemption provisions do not apply to the CLOs.\nThe following tables present certain information with respect to the investment funds managed by HCS, JMPAM, HCAP Advisors, and JMPCA:\nTable 145:

Principal transaction revenues also include earnings, or losses, attributable to interests in investment partnerships managed by our asset management subsidiaries, HCS and JMPAM, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. In addition, our principal transaction revenues include unrealized gains or losses on an investment in an entity that acquires buildings and land for the purpose of holding, managing and selling the properties and also include unrealized gains or losses on the investments in other private companies.\nGain (Loss) on Sale and Payoff of Loans\nGain (loss) on sale and payoff of loans consists of gains and losses from the sale and payoff of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities and loans held for investment. Gains are recorded when the proceeds exceed the carrying value of the loan.\nNet Dividend Income\nNet dividend income includes dividends from our investments offset by dividend expense resulting from short positions in our principal investment portfolio.\nOther Income\nOther income includes revenues from equity method investments, revenues from fee-sharing arrangements with our funds, and fees earned to raise capital for third-party investment partnerships.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of interest income earned on loans collateralizing asset-backed securities (\"ABS\") issued and loans held for investment. Interest income on loans is comprised of the stated coupon as a percentage of the face amount receivable as well as accretion of purchase discounts and deferred fees. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the respective loans, unless such loans are placed on non-accrual status.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense related to ABS issued, Senior Notes, notes payable, line of credit, and any warehouse credit facilities, as well as the amortization of bond issuance costs. Interest expense on ABS issued is the stated coupon payable as a percentage of the principal amount in addition to amortization of the liquidity discount that was recorded at the acquisition date. Interest expense is recorded on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the respective debt instrument.\nLoss on Repurchase, Reissuance, or Early Retirement of Debt\nLoss on repurchase, reissuance, or early retirement of debt primarily consists of losses incurred in the write-off of debt issuance costs related to Senior Notes or ABS issued that have been repurchased or retired sooner than the life of the instrument.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nProvision for loan losses includes the provision for losses recognized on our loan notes and non-revolving credit agreements at JMP Capital and JMP Investment Holdings (collectively loans held for investment) and on loans collateralizing ABS in order to record the loans held for investment and ABS at their estimated net realizable value. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that is intended to estimate loan losses inherent in our loan portfolios. A provision for loan losses is charged to expense to establish the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level, in the opinion of management, sufficient to offset estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. The appropriateness of the allowance and the allowance components are reviewed quarterly. Our estimate of each allowance component is based on observable information and on market and third-party data that we believe are reflective of the underlying loan losses being estimated. We employ internally developed and third-party estimation tools for measuring credit risk (loan ratings, probability of default, and exposure at default).\nA specific reserve is provided for loans that are considered impaired. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We measure impairment of a loan based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, if the loan is collateral-dependent, depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy. For loans deemed impaired at the date of acquisition, if there is a further decline in expected future cash flows, this reduction is recognized as a specific reserve in accordance with the guidance above. For those loans deemed impaired subsequent to the acquisition date, if the net realizable value is lower than the current carrying value, the carrying value is reduced, and the difference is booked as a provision for loan losses. If the total discount from unpaid principal balance to carrying value is larger than the expected loss at the date of assessment, no provision for loan losses is recognized.\nLoans which are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off, and the charged-off amount is deducted from the allowance.\nComponents of Expenses\nWe classify our expenses as compensation and benefits; administration; brokerage, clearing and exchange fees; travel and business development; managed deal expenses, communications and technology; occupancy; professional fees, depreciation, and other. A significant portion of our expense base is variable, including compensation and benefits; brokerage, clearing and exchange fees; travel and business development; managed deal expenses, communication and technology expenses.\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits is the largest component of our expenses and includes employees' base pay, performance bonuses, sales commissions, related payroll taxes, and medical and benefits expenses, as well as expenses for contractors, temporary employees, and equity-based compensation. Our employees receive a substantial portion of their compensation in the form of an individual, performance-based bonus. As is the widespread practice in our industry, we pay bonuses, for the most part, on an annual basis, and for senior professionals these bonuses typically make up a large portion of their total compensation. A portion of the performance-based bonuses paid to certain senior professionals is paid in the form of deferred compensation. Bonus payments may have a greater impact on our cash position and liquidity in the periods in which they are paid than would otherwise be reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We accrue for the estimated amount of these bonus payments ratably over the applicable service period.\nCompensation is accrued with specific ratios of total compensation and benefits to total revenues applied to specific revenue categories, with adjustments made if, in management's opinion, such adjustments are necessary and appropriate to maintain competitive compensation levels.\nAdministration\nAdministration expense primarily includes the cost of hosted conferences, non-capitalized systems and software expenditures, insurance, business tax (non-income), office supplies, recruiting, and regulatory fees.\nBrokerage, Clearing, and Exchange Fees\nBrokerage, clearing, and exchange fees include the cost of floor and electronic brokerage and execution, securities clearance, and exchange fees. Changes in brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees fluctuate largely in line with the volume of our sales and trading activity.\nTravel and Business Development\nTravel and business development expense primarily consists of costs incurred traveling to client locations for the purposes of executing transactions or meeting potential new clients, travel for administrative functions, and other costs incurred in developing new business. Travel costs related to existing clients for mergers and acquisitions and underwriting deals are sometimes reimbursed by clients. Under the new revenue standard ASC 606, reimbursed costs are presented as revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nManaged Deal Expenses\nManaged deal expenses primarily relate to costs incurred and/or allocated in the execution of investment banking transactions, including reimbursable costs. Under the new revenue standard ASC 606, reimbursed costs are presented as revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCommunications and Technology\nCommunications and technology expense primarily relates to the cost of communication and connectivity, information processing and subscriptions to certain market data feeds and services.\nOccupancy Expenses\nOccupancy costs primarily include payments made under operating leases that are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.\nProfessional Fees\nProfessional fees primarily relate to legal and accounting professional services.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation expenses include the straight-line amortization of purchases of certain furniture and fixtures, computer and office equipment, certain software costs, and leasehold improvements to allocate their depreciation amounts over their estimated useful life.\nOther Expenses\nOther operating expenses primarily includes bad debt expense and CLO administration expense.\nIncome Taxes\nSince January 2015, JMP Group LLC has been a publicly traded partnership and, as such, has been taxed as a partnership, and not as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income.\u201d On January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than a partnership, going forward. The Company expects this election will be retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019. In April 2019, the Company expects to initiate regular quarterly cash distributions, intended to reflect an annual payout ratio of approximately 50% of operating net income. As a partnership, the Company targeted an annual payout ratio of approximately 90% to 100%.\nThe Company's effective tax rate is directly impacted by the proportion of income subject to tax compared to income not subject to tax. JMP Group Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. The remainder of the Company's income is generally not subject to corporate-level taxation.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions using a two-step process: (i) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that each tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority\nThe Company's policy for recording interest and penalties associated with the tax audits or unrecognized tax benefits, if any, is to record such items as a component of income tax.\nNon-controlling Interest\nNon-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the interest of third parties in CLO III, HCS Strategic Investments LLC, and HCAP Advisors, partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements. Non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the interest of third parties in CLO I, CLO II, CLO III, and HCAP Advisors.\nThe Company currently manages several asset management funds, which are structured as limited partnerships, or limited liability companies, and is the general partner or managing member of each. The Company assesses whether the partnerships or companies meet the definition of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) in accordance with ASC 810-10-15-14 and whether the Company qualifies as the primary beneficiary. Funds determined not to meet the definition of a VIE are considered voting interest entities, for which the rights of the limited partners are evaluated to determine if consolidation is necessary. Such guidance provides that the presumption that the general partner or managing member controls the limited partnership or limited liability company may be overcome if the limited partners have substantive kick-out rights.\nThe Company owned approximately 94% of the subordinated notes of the issuer of CLO I. CLO I completed its liquidation in the first quarter of 2017. The Company was identified as the primary beneficiary, based on the ability to direct activities of CLO I through its subsidiary manager, JMPCA, and its equity ownership.\nThe Company, through JMPCA, a wholly-owned subsidiary, managed CLO II from issuance through its liquidation in the second quarter of 2017. From issuance through December 31, 2013, the Company owned $17.3 million, or 72.8%, of the subordinated notes of the issuer. In the first quarter of 2014, the Company repurchased $6.0 million of subordinated notes, increasing its ownership to 98.0%. In March 2017, the Company repurchased $7.0 million of Class F notes. CLO II completed its liquidation in the second quarter of 2017. The Company was identified as the primary beneficiary, based on the ability to direct activities of CLO II through its subsidiary manager, JMPCA, and its equity ownership.\nThe Company, through JMPCA, a wholly-owned subsidiary, has managed CLO III since issuance. From issuance through September 27, 2016, the Company owned $5.2 million or 13.5% of the subordinated notes of the issuer. On September 27, 2016, the Company repurchased $12.8 million face value of the subordinated notes, increasing its ownership to 46.7%. The Company was identified as the primary beneficiary, based on the ability to direct activities of CLO III through its subsidiary manager, JMPCA, and its equity ownership. In February 2018, the Company closed a refinancing of the asset-backed securities issued by CLO III, which lowered the weighted average costs of funds by 55 basis points and extended the reinvestment period for two years. In connection with the refinancing, the Company recorded losses on early retirement of debt related to unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nHCAP Advisors was formed on December 18, 2012. HCAP Advisors appointed JMP Holding LLC as its Manager effective May 1, 2013 and began offering investment advisory services. The Company owned a 51.0% equity interest in the entity until April 27, 2018 when the Company purchased an additional 18.4% of HCAP Advisors equity from a non-controlling interest holder. As of April 27, 2018, the Company owns a 69.4% of equity interest in the entity. The Company was identified as the primary beneficiary, based on the ability to direct activities of HCAP Advisors as the Manager and its equity ownership.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table

2017\nOverview\nTotal net revenues after provision for loan losses increased $26.0 million, or 23.6% from $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $136.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily resulting from a $10.8 million increase in investment banking revenue, a $4.2 million decrease in losses on principal transactions, a $9.5 million increase in net interest income, and a $3.3 million decrease in losses on repurchase, reissuance, or early retirement of debt.\nNon-interest revenues increased $14.0 million, or 12.4%, from $113.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $127.4 million in the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by a $10.8 million increase in investment banking revenues, a $1.1 million increase in asset management revenues, and a $4.2 million increase in revenues from principal transactions, partially offset by $1.3 million increases in losses on sale, payoff, and mark-to-market of loans. Of the total of investment banking revenues earned, $6.5 million of revenue is related to a gross up of expenses as a result of the Company's adoption of ASC 606. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the new revenue standard and accounts affected by adoption.\nNet interest income increased $9.4 million, or 127.2% from $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLoss on repurchase, reissuance, or early retirement of debt decreased $3.3 million, from a loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 to a loss of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProvision for loan losses increased $0.7 million, or 17.4% from $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTotal non-interest expenses increased $14.5 million, or 11.9% from $122.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $136.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a $6.8 million increase in compensation and benefits, a $1.4 million increase in administration expenses, $0.8 million increase in travel and business development, $4.8 million increase in managed deal expenses, and a $1.0 million increase in professional fee. Of the $14.5 million increase in expenses, $6.5 million of the increase is related to a gross-up of expenses as a result of the Company's adoption of ASC 606. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the new revenue standard and accounts affected by adoption.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased $1.5 million, or 61.6%, from $2.5 million to $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nNet income attributable to JMP Group LLC increased $13.7 million, or 86.2%, from a net loss $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a net loss of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily attributed to an increase in net revenue after provision for loan losses of $26.0 million partially offset by an increase in non-interest expenses of $14.5 million.\nOperating Net Income (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nManagement uses Operating Net Income as a key, non-GAAP metric when evaluating the performance of JMP Group LLC's core business strategy and ongoing operations, as management believes that this metric appropriately illustrates the operating results of JMP Group LLC's core operations and business activities. Operating Net Income is derived from our segment reported results and is the measure of segment profitability on an after-tax basis used by management to evaluate our performance. This non-GAAP measure is presented to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance. Additionally, management believes that Operating Net Income is a useful measure because it allows for a better evaluation of the performance of JMP Group LLC's ongoing business and facilitates a meaningful comparison of the Company's results in a given period to those in prior and future periods.\nHowever, Operating Net Income should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that, unless otherwise indicated, the adjustments concern gains, losses or expenses that JMP Group LLC generally expects to continue to recognize, and the adjustment of these items should not always be construed as an inference that these gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, management believes that both JMP Group LLC's GAAP measures of its financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together. Operating Net Income may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies.\nOperating Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the Company's GAAP net income as follows:\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> reverses share-based compensation expense recognized under GAAP related to equity awards granted in prior periods, as management generally evaluates performance by considering the full expense of equity awards in the period in which they are granted, even if the expense of such compensation will be recognized in future periods under GAAP;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> recognizes 100% of the cost of deferred compensation in the period for which such compensation was awarded, instead of recognizing such cost over the vesting period as required under GAAP, in order to match compensation expense with the actual period upon which the compensation was based;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> reverses amortization expense related to an intangible asset resulting from the repurchase of a portion of the equity of CLO III;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (iv)\n</td> <td>unrealized gains or losses on commercial real estate investments, adjusted for non-cash expenditures, including depreciation and amortization; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (v)\n</td> <td> reverses net unrealized gains and losses on strategic equity investments and certain warrant positions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (vi)\n</td> <td> excludes general loan loss provisions related to the CLOs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (vii)\n</td> <td> reverses the one-time transaction costs related to the refinancing of the debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (viii)\n</td> <td>reverses one-time expenses associated with the redemption of debt underlying the CLOs, the redemption of other debt, and the resulting acceleration of the amortization of remaining capitalized issuance costs for each; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (ix)\n</td> <td> assumes a combined federal, state and local income tax rate of 26% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 38% for the year ended December 31, 2017, at the Company's taxable direct subsidiary, adjusted for a cap on allowable interest expense deduction due to recent tax reform, while applying a tax rate of 0% to the Company's other direct subsidiary, which is a pass-through entity\u201d for tax purposes; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(x) </td> <td>presents revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates the CLOs and removes any non-controlling interest in consolidated but less than wholly owned subsidiaries. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDiscussed below is our Operating Net Income (Loss) by segment.

In addition, of the total investment banking revenue earned during the year ended December 31, 2018, $6.5 million is related to a gross up of expenses as a result of the Company's adoption of ASC 606.

Fees reported as other income were $1.0 million and $1.4 million for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, other income was 0.7% and 1.2% for both of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTotal segment asset management-related fees include base management fees and incentive fees from our funds, HCC, and CLOs under management, as well as other income from fee-sharing arrangements with, and fees earned to raise capital for, third-party or equity-method investment partnerships or funds. Total segment asset management-related fee revenues are reconciled to the GAAP measure, total asset management fee revenues, in the table above. We believe that presenting operating asset management-related fees is useful to investors as a means of assessing the performance of our combined asset management activities, including fundraising and other services for third parties. We believe that segment asset management-related fee revenues provides useful information by indicating the relative contributions of base management fees and performance-related incentive fees, thus facilitating a comparison of those fees in a given period to those in prior and future periods. We also believe that asset management-related fee revenue is a more meaningful measure than standalone asset management fees as reported, because asset management-related fee revenues represent the combined impact of the various asset management activities on the Company's total net revenues.\nTotal segment asset management related fee revenue increased $0.6 million, from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Total base management fees were $12.2 million and $14.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total incentive fees increased $3.7 million, from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $6.1 million for the same period in 2018. On an operating basis, asset management related fee revenues were 13.6% and 15.0% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a percentage of adjusted net revenues.\nPrincipal Transactions\nPrincipal transaction revenues changed $4.1 million, from a loss of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a loss of $2.3 million for the same period in 2018. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, principal transaction revenues were negative 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a negative 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTotal segment principal transaction revenues decreased $2.4 million, from a gain of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a gain of $1.0 million for the same period in 2018. Total segment principal transaction revenues are a non-GAAP financial measure that aggregates our segment reported principal transaction revenues across each segment. The principal transaction revenues for both 2018 and 2017 were reported in our Investment Income segment. Total segment principal transaction revenues are reconciled to the GAAP measure, total principal transaction revenues, in the table below.\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity and other securities excluding non-controlling interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(933 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,190 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warrants and other investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>760 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment partnerships\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total segment principal transaction revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,354 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating adjustment addbacks\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,317 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,791 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total principal transaction revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,287 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,437 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a GAAP basis, the increase in principal transaction revenues is primarily attributed to the cessation of recording equity-method losses in an investment whose carrying value has been reduced to zero on the balance sheet, partially offset by decreases in net income earned on hedge fund investments. On an operating basis, as a percentage of total adjusted net revenues, principal transaction revenues decreased from 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 0.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain and Loss on Sale and Payoff of Loans\nGain on sale and payoff of loans decreased from a gain of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gain and loss on sale and payoff of loans was incurred in our Investment Income segment. On an operating basis, gain on sale and payoff of loans decreased from a gain of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a loss of $0.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.\nNet Dividend Income\nNet dividend income was $1.3 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net dividend income primarily related to dividends from our HCC investment.\nNet Interest Income/Expense\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December

year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven primarily by the increased net asset balance at CLO V, which was in the warehouse phase in 2017 and securitized in July 2018. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, net interest income was 12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal segment net interest income increased from $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net interest income is reported in our Investment Income segment and reflects our portion of the net CLO contractual interest. Total segment net interest income is reconciled to the GAAP measure, total net interest expense, in the table above. As a percentage of total adjusted net revenues, net interest income was 9.0% and 2.8% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth contractual interest

As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, managed deal expenses increased from zero percent for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 3.6% for the same period in 2018. The increase is related to a gross up of expenses as a result of the Company's adoption of ASC 606. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the new revenue standard and accounts affected by adoption.\nCommunications and Technology\nCommunications and technology expenses were $4.1 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, communications and technology expense decreased to 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017\nOccupancy\nOccupancy expenses were $4.8 and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, occupancy expenses were 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and were 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProfessional Fees\nProfessional fees were $5.4 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, professional fees were 4.0% for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation expenses were $1.1 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, depreciation was 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses were $2.0 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, other expenses was 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest was $1.0 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the interest of third parties in CLO III, HCAP Advisors, and HCS Strategic Investments LLC. Non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes the interest of third parties in CLO I, CLO II, CLO III, and HCAP Advisors.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, while an income tax expense of $1.7 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the purposes of calculating operating net income, a combined federal and state tax rate of 26% is assumed for our taxable direct subsidiaries, adjusted for a cap on allowable interest expense deduction due to recent tax reform, while a rate of 0% is applied to our direct subsidiary, which is a pass-through entity\u201d for tax purposes.\nSegment income tax was an expense of $0.9 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe decrease was mainly due to a lower projected effective tax rate for the current year than the prior year.\nU.S. federal corporate income tax reform included a broad range of proposals affecting businesses, including corporate tax rates, business deductions and international tax provisions. The reduction in the federal corporate tax rate required a revaluation of our deferred tax assets at the corporate entity level. International tax provisions, including a shift to a territorial system, did not impact JMP Group LLC's investment in foreign corporations, as the Company has historically included accumulated earnings and profits from controlled foreign corporations.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nIn the section that follows, we discuss the significant changes in the components of our balance sheet, cash flows, and capital resources and liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2018 to demonstrate where our capital is invested and the financial condition of the Company.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had net liquid assets of $46.0 million consisting of cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from short sales on deposit, receivable from clearing broker, marketable securities owned, and general partner investments in hedge funds managed by HCS, net of marketable securities sold but not yet purchased, accrued compensation, deferred compensation paid in January 2019, and non-controlling interest. We have satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of the Senior Notes and internally generated cash from operations. Most of our financial instruments, other than loans collateralizing ASB issued, loans held for investment, and ABS issued, are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value.\nLiquidity Considerations Related to CLOs\nOur maximum exposure to loss of capital on the CLOs is the $13.3 million investment related to CLO III, $36.8 million investment in CLO IV and $28.7 million in CLO V as of December 31, 2018, plus our portion of the earnings retained in the CLOs since the inception dates. However, for U.S. federal tax purposes, the CLOs are treated as disregarded entities such that the taxable income earned in the CLO is taxable to us. If the CLOs are in violation of certain coverage tests, mainly any of their over-collateralization ratios, residual cash flows otherwise payable to us as owners of the subordinated notes would be required to be used to buy additional collateral or to repay indebtedness senior to us in the securitization. This could require us to pay income tax on earnings prior to the residual cash flow distributions to us.\nThe CLOs must comply with certain asset coverage tests, such as tests that restrict the amount of discounted obligations and obligations rated CCC\u201d or lower it can hold. Defaulted obligations, discounted assets and assets rated CCC\u201d or lower in excess of applicable limits in the CLOs investment criteria are not given full par credit for purposes of calculation of the CLO over-collateralization ( OC\u201d) tests. If any of the CLOs were to violate any of the secured note OC tests, we would be required to pay down the most senior notes with the residual cash flows until the violation was cured. In the most extreme case, if a CLO were in violation of the most senior OC test, the Class A note holders would have the ability to declare an event of default and cause an acceleration of all principal and interest outstanding on the notes. The CLOs were in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the loans and ABS of the CLOs are consolidated on our balance sheet. The loans are reported at their cost adjusted for credit reserves, purchase discounts, and allowance for loan losses. The ABS are recorded net of liquidity discounts and original issue discounts. At December 31, 2018, we had $1,161.5 million of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities, $26.0 million of loans held for investment, net, $58.4 million of restricted cash and $2.7 million of interest receivable funded by $1,122.2 million of asset-backed securities issued, net, $22.5 million of draws on warehouse credit facilities, and interest payable of $10.2 million. These assets and liabilities in the CLOs and CLO warehouse represented 87.9% of total assets and 87.7% of total liabilities, respectively, reported on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at December 31, 2018.\nThe tables below summarize the loans held by the CLOs and warehouse grouped by range of outstanding balance, Moody's Investors Services, Inc. (\"Moody's\") rating category and industry as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

payable, and warehouse credit facility. We have no outstanding balances on our revolving lines of credit with City National Bank ( CNB\u201d) held at JMP Securities or JMP Holding LLC.\nIn January 2013, we raised approximately $46.0 million from the issuance of 8.00% Senior Notes ( 2013 Senior Notes\u201d). In January 2014, we raised approximately $48.3 million from the issuance of 7.25% Senior Notes ( 2014 Senior Notes\u201d), which were fully redeemed on December 28, 2017 and for which the Company recognized a $0.8 million loss on the early retirement of the 2014 Senior Notes. In November 2017, we raised approximately $50.0 million from the issuance of 7.25% Senior Notes ( 2017 Senior Notes\u201d and, together with the 2013 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes\u201d). The 2013 Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after January 15, 2016, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2013 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per year, payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2017 Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2027 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after November 28, 2020, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2017 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year, payable quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year. The Company redeemed $10.0 million of the issued and outstanding 2013 Senior Notes on July 31, 2018. The Company recorded a loss of $0.2 million related to this partial retirement of the 2013 Senior Notes.\nIn connection with the Reorganization Transaction, pursuant to which JMP Group Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of JMP Group LLC, we entered into a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2014 (the Third Supplemental Indenture\u201d), among JMP Group Inc., as issuer, and JMP Group LLC and JMP Investment Holdings LLC, as guarantors (the Guarantors\u201d), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Third Supplemental Indenture became effective on January 1, 2015. Under the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Guarantors have jointly and severally provided a full and unconditional guarantee of the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest on the Senior Notes and the due and punctual payment or performance of all other obligations of JMP Group Inc. under the Indenture, dated as of January 24, 2013, between JMP Group Inc. and the Trustee, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 25, 2013, a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 29, 2014, a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2014, and a Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 28, 2017.\nThe Company's Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), dated as of August 3, 2006, was entered into by and between JMP Holding LLC and City National Bank ( CNB\u201d), and was subsequently amended. The Credit Agreement and subsequent amendments provide a $25.0 million line of credit with a revolving period through June 4, 2019. On such date, any outstanding amounts convert to a term loan. The term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments of 3.75% of funded debt for the first two years, 5.00% of funded debt for the next two years, and the remainder due at maturity. Proceeds for this line of credit will be used to make financial investments, for working capital purposes, for general corporate purposes, as well as a $5.0 million sublimit to issue letters of credit. The Company had no outstanding balance on this line of credit as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe Credit Agreement for the line of credit provides that the proceeds of the CNB loans are subject to the following restrictions: (i) up to $5.0 million of the revolving line of credit loans may not be used for any purpose other than to fund certain permitted investments and acquisitions and to fund JMP Holding's working capital needs in the ordinary course of its business; and (ii) all other proceeds of the revolving line of credit may not be used for any purpose other than to make investments in HCS and by HCS to make investments in loans that are made to persons that are not affiliates of borrower.\nThe Credit Agreement includes a minimum fixed charge applicable to us and our subsidiaries, a minimum net worth covenant applicable to us and our subsidiaries and a minimum liquidity covenant applicable to JMP Holding LLC and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of these financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes an event of default for a change of control\u201d that tests, in part, the composition of our ownership and an event of default if two or more of the members of the Company's executive committee fail to be involved actively on an ongoing basis in the management of JMP Holding LLC or any of its subsidiaries.\nSeparately, under a Revolving Note and Cash Subordination Agreement, JMP Securities holds a $20.0 million revolving line of credit with CNB to be used for regulatory capital purposes during its securities underwriting activities. The unused portion of the line bears interest at the rate of 0.25% per annum, paid monthly. On June 6, 2018, JMP Securities entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d). Pursuant to this Amendment, the $20.0 million line of credit was renewed for one year. On June 6, 2019, any existing outstanding amount will convert to a term loan maturing the following year. The remaining terms of this line of credit are consistent with those of the existing line of credit. There was no borrowing on this line of credit as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on debt, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. A violation of any one of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which would permit CNB to terminate the Company's note and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding principal and interest. At both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company was in compliance with the loan covenants.\nOn July 31, 2017, the Company, through an affiliate, established a $200.0 million revolving credit facility with BNP Paribas for the CLO V warehouse to finance the acquisition of a portfolio of assets, including certain debt obligations. The Company, through an affiliate, subsequently entered into amendments to the credit facility and as of June 21, 2018, the credit facility was increased to $340.0 million. On July 26, 2018, the credit facility was fully repaid using proceeds from the securitization of CLO V. The balance of the facility was zero as of December 31, 2018 and $61.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company, entered into a Repurchase Agreement with BNP Paribas to finance the acquisition of asset-backed securities issued by CLO III in connection with risk retention requirements. During the second quarter of 2018 the Company fully repaid the outstanding balance and sold the assets collateralizing the agreement. As of December 31, 2018, there was no balance outstanding in connection with the Repurchase Agreement.\nOn October 11, 2018, the Company established through its affiliate, JMP Credit Advisors Long-Term Warehouse Ltd., a Cayman Islands vehicle (the Borrower\u201d), and the Borrower's subsidiary, JMP Credit Advisors CLO VI Warehouse Ltd., a Cayman Islands vehicle (the CLO Subsidiary\u201d and, together with the Borrower, the Borrower Entities\u201d), a $100.0 million revolving credit facility with BNP Paribas for the CLO VI warehouse to finance the acquisition of a portfolio of assets, including certain debt obligations. All borrowings under the credit facility will be subject to the satisfaction of certain customary covenants, the accuracy of certain representations and warranties, concentration limitations and other restrictions. The credit facility will be primarily secured by a portfolio of broadly syndicated corporate loans. The credit facility is structured to have a revolving period of up to three years ending October 11, 2021, and a twelve-month amortization period. The credit facility has a market standard advance rate, and any outstanding balances bear interest at standard market interest rates based on LIBOR. The balance of the credit facility was $22.5 million as of December 31, 2018. JMPCA acts as collateral manager with duties including the selection of loans to be acquired by the Borrower Entities. JMP Capital LLC entered into a Preference Share Subscription Agreement with the Borrower to purchase mandatorily redeemable Preference Shares of the Borrower in an initial amount of $7,500,000 to support the initial borrowing under the Facility. JMP Capital LLC may purchase additional Preference Shares up to $33,333,333 in the aggregate to support additional borrowing under the Facility. The proceeds from the Preference Shares will be used to acquire portfolio assets, repay loans under the Facility, or as otherwise permitted under the transaction documentation. All or a portion of the Preference Shares will be redeemed upon the closing of a CLO transaction.\nThe timing of bonus compensation payments to our employees may significantly affect our cash position and liquidity from period to period. While our employees and managing directors are generally paid semi-monthly during the year, bonus compensation, which makes up a larger portion of total compensation, is generally paid once a year during the first two months of the following year. In the first two months of 2018, we paid out $37.1 million of cash bonuses for 2018, excluding employer payroll tax expense.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 194,959 of the Company's shares at an average price of $4.79 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $0.9 million on the open market.\nWe had total restricted cash of $61.9 million comprised primarily of $58.4 million of restricted cash related to the CLOs as of December 31, 2018. This balance was comprised of $18.5 million in interest received from loans in the CLOs, and $39.9 million in principal cash. The interest and fees will be restricted until the next payment date to note holders of the CLOs. The principal restricted cash will be used to buy additional loans or pay down the senior debt in the CLOs.\nBecause of the nature of our investment banking and sales and trading businesses, liquidity is important to us. Accordingly, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including our cash and net capital positions. We believe that our available liquidity and current level of equity capital, combined with the funds anticipated to be provided by our operating activities, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and regulatory capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. If circumstances required it, we could improve our liquidity position by discontinuing repurchases of the Company's common shares, halting cash distributions on our common shares and reducing cash bonus compensation paid.\nJMP Securities, our wholly-owned subsidiary and a registered securities broker-dealer, is subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1. JMP Securities had net capital of $29.8 million and $37.3 million, which were $28.7 million and $35.9 million in excess of the required net capital of $1.1 million and $1.4 million, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. JMP Securities' ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 0.57 to 1 and 0.58 to 1 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nA condensed table of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is presented below.\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change from 2017 to 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>597.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(333,910 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(130,359 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(203,551 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-156.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided (used in) by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>307,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48,550 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>356,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>734.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash flows\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,513 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(175,827 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2018\nCash decreased by $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of cash used in investing activities, partially offset by cash provided by operating and financing activities.\nOur operating activities provided $21.5 million of cash from the net loss of $1.2 million, adjusted for the cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of $11.4 million, and provided by non-cash revenue and expense items of $11.4 million. The cash provided by the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in other assets of $6.0 million, an increase of $4.7 million in interest payable, a $2.6 million decrease in receivables, and a $2.0 million decrease in marketable securities owned, partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in marketable securities sold, but not yet purchased.\nOur investing activities used $333.9 million of cash primarily due to a $434.8 million funding of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued and $339.9 million of funding for loans held for investment, partially offset by the $399.2 million of receipts from loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued, $29.5 million of receipts from loans held for investments, and $15.2 million from the sale of other investments.\nOur financing activities provided $307.9 million of cash primarily due to $669.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of asset-backed securities due to the refinancing of CLO III and the securitization of CLO V, $286.3 million in proceeds from draws on the CLO warehouse credit facilities, partially offset by $332.4 million of repayments on asset-backed securities issued, $325.0 million in repayments on the CLO warehouse credit facilities, $10.0 million of repayments on bonds payable and $7.9 million in distributions and distribution equivalents paid on common shares and restricted share units.\nCash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2017\nCash decreased by $175.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of cash used in investing and financing activities, partially offset by cash provided from operating activities.\nOur operating activities provided $3.1 million of cash from the net loss of $13.4 million, adjusted for the cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $3.0 million, and provided by non-cash revenue and expense items of $19.5 million. The cash used by the change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a $7.7 million decrease in other liabilities and a $4.0 increase in receivables, partially offset by a $6.8 million decrease in accrued compensation and a $3.2 million increase in market securities sold but not yet purchased.\nOur investing activities used $130.4 million of cash primarily due $507.6 million of funding for loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued and $82.0 million of funding of loans held for investment, partially offset by $389.6 million of receipts from loans collateralizing asset-backed securities, $33.0 million of proceeds from loans held for sale, $25.0 million of cash provided by changes in cash collateral posted for derivative transactions, and $14.6 million of proceeds from sale of other investments.\nOur financing activities used $48.6 million of cash primarily due to $503.6 million of repayments of asset-backed securities issued relating to the liquidation of CLO I and CLO II and $47.9 million in repurchases of bonds payable related to redemptions of the 2014 Senior Notes, partially offset by $408.4 million of proceeds from issuance of asset-backed securities due to the securitization of CLO IV, $61.3 million of proceeds from draws on the CLO V warehouse facility, and $50.0 million in proceeds from the 2017 Senior Notes.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, our aggregate minimum future commitment on our leases was $35.1 million. See Note 13 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2018, $86.0 million of bonds payable were outstanding, of which $36.0 million, which carries interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum, is due in 2023 and the remaining $50.00 million, which carries interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum, is due in 2027. The bonds require quarterly payments of interest. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, $22.5 million was outstanding on the CLO VI Warehouse Credit Facility which is due October 11, 2021 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.250%. The Company also had a $0.8 million note payable outstanding which is due in 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 12.5% per annum. See Note 7 to the notes to the consolidated financials for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2018, $1,121.3 million of asset-backed securities were outstanding of which $332.1 million are due in 2028, $414.0 million are due in 2029 and $377.5 million are due in 2030. The asset-backed securities bear interest at rates ranging from LIBOR plus 0.85% to LIBOR plus 5.75%. All interest is deferred and payable only payable subject to cash available from the proceeds of the related CLO portfolio. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had unfunded commitments to lend of $1.4 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Had the borrower drawn on these, the Company would have been obligated to fund them. The funds for the unfunded commitments to lend and the cash collateral supporting these standby letters of credit are included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2018. The CLO-related commitments do not extend to JMP Group LLC. See Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in connection with the CLOs.\nUnfunded commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower, provided that all conditions have been met. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each borrower's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to borrowers.\nWe had no other material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018. However, through indemnification provisions in our clearing agreements with our clearing broker, customer activities may expose us to off-balance sheet credit risk, which we seek to mitigate through customer screening and collateral requirements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The use of different estimates and assumptions could produce materially different results. For example, if factors such as those described under the caption Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements in our Annual Report cause actual events to differ from the assumptions we used in applying the accounting policies, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We regard an accounting estimate or assumption to be most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations where:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the impact of the estimates or assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUsing the foregoing criteria, we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies:\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures with respect to fair value measurements. The accounting principles related to fair value measurement apply to all financial instruments that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis. This includes those items currently reported in marketable securities owned, at fair value, other investments and marketable securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nMost of our financial instruments, other than loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued, loans held for investment, and asset-backed securities issued, are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Marketable securities owned, other investments, including warrant positions and investments in partnerships in which HCS is the general partner, and marketable securities sold, but not yet purchased, are stated at fair value, with related changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in the line item Principal transactions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFair value of our financial instruments is generally obtained from quoted market prices, third-party pricing services, or alternative pricing methodologies that we believe offer reasonable levels of price transparency. Valuations obtained from pricing services are considered reflective of executable prices. Data obtained from multiple sources are compared for consistency and reasonableness. To the extent that certain financial instruments trade infrequently or are non-marketable securities and, therefore, do not have readily determinable fair values, we estimate the fair value of these instruments using various pricing models and the information available to us that we deem most relevant. Among the factors considered by us in determining the fair value of financial instruments are discounted anticipated cash flows, the cost, terms and liquidity of the instrument, the financial condition, operating results and credit ratings of the issuer or underlying company, the quoted market price of publicly traded securities with similar duration and yield, the Black-Scholes Options Valuation methodology and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of financial instruments.\nMarketable securities owned and securities sold, but not yet purchased, consist of U.S. listed and over-the-counter (\"OTC\") equity securities. Other investments include investments in private investment funds managed by us or our affiliates, as well as cash paid for a subscription in a private investment fund managed by a third party. Such investments held by non-broker-dealer entities are accounted for under the equity method based on our share of the earnings (or losses) of the investee. The financial position and operating results of the private investment funds are generally determined on an estimated fair value basis. Generally, securities are valued (i) at their last published sale price if they are listed on an established exchange or (ii) if last sales prices are not published, at the highest closing bid\u201d price (for securities held long\u201d) and the lowest closing asked\u201d price (for short\u201d positions) as recorded by the composite tape system or such principal exchange, as the case may be. Where the general partner determines that market prices or quotations do not fairly represent the value of a security in the investment fund's portfolio (for example, if a security is a restricted security of a class that is publicly traded) the general partner may assign a different value. The general partner will determine the estimated fair value of any assets that are not publicly traded.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its investments in private investment funds managed by third parties using the net asset value per share of those funds, as a practical expedient.\nThe Company uses the fair value option which allows an entity to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. The fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been chosen is reflected on the face of the balance sheet. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following tables summarize our marketable securities and other investments, as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, by valuation methodology as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

mainly of U.S. listed and OTC equity securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Management Investment Partnerships\nInvestments in partnerships include our general partnership and limited partnership interests in investment partnerships, managed by our asset management subsidiaries. Such investments are accounted for under the equity method based on our proportionate share of the earnings (or losses) of the investment partnership or under the fair value option using the net asset value per share of those funds, as a practical expedient. Under the fair value option, these interests are carried at estimated fair value based on our capital accounts in the underlying partnerships. The assets of the investment partnerships consist primarily of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities, real estate and real estate-related enterprises and corporate loans. The underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on quoted market prices or estimated fair value if there is no public market for such assets. Such estimates of fair value of the partnerships' non-marketable investments are ultimately determined by our asset management subsidiaries in their capacity as general partner. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation, fair values of these non-marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments, and the differences could be material. Adjustments to carrying value are made, as required by GAAP, if there are third-party transactions evidencing a change in value. Downward adjustments are also made, in the absence of third-party transactions, if the general partner determines that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value.\nWe earn base management fees from the investment partnerships that we manage generally based on the net assets of the underlying partnerships. In addition, we are entitled to allocations of the appreciation and depreciation in the fair value of the underlying partnerships from our general partnership interests in the partnerships. Such allocations are based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements.\nWe are also entitled to receive incentive fee allocations from the investment partnerships when the return exceeds a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined performance period. Incentive fees are recorded after the quarterly or annual investment performance period is complete and may vary depending on the terms of the fee structure applicable to an investor.\nLoans Collateralizing Asset-Backed Securities Issued\nLoans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued are recorded at their fair value as of the acquisition date, which then becomes the new basis of the loans. Any unamortized deferred fees or costs that existed prior to the acquisition are written off at that date.\nFor those loans acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination, the total discount from unpaid principal balance to fair value consists of a non-accretable credit discount and an accretable liquidity discount. The accretable portion of the discount is recognized into interest income as an adjustment to the yield of the loan over the contractual life of the loan using the interest method.\nFor those loans without evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination, any difference between the Company's initial investment in the loan and its par value is recorded as a premium or discount, which is amortized or accreted in interest income as a yield adjustment over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method, in accordance with ASC 310-20, Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs.\nThe Company reviews its loan portfolio at the end of each quarter to identify specific loss reserves on impaired loans or to record losses inherent in the homogenous loan portfolio. As loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued are considered similar in nature, given the loan terms, ratings and average life expectancy, they are reviewed collectively in the quarterly assessment of loan loss reserves. Even when there are no credit losses identified in any individual loans, experience indicates there are losses inherent in the pooled loan portfolios as of the balance sheet date. The Company uses its loan loss model to estimate the unidentified losses that are inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date and records provisions to its allowance for loan losses quarterly.\nFor loans acquired at a discount that are not accounted for under ASC 310-30, the allowance for loan losses recorded subsequent to the date of the loan acquisition is determined using the guidance in ASC 450. No allowance on these loans will be recognized until the current book value is accreted past the level of incurred loss. For loans acquired at a premium, the allowance for loan losses recorded subsequent to the date of the loan acquisition is determined in accordance with ASC 450, based on the contractual principal balances. Given the existence of the premium on these loans, the allowance recorded subsequent to acquisition is based on the Company's quarterly allowance methodology and represents losses inherent in the homogeneous loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Accordingly, if the Company were to acquire loans at a premium during a particular period, the Company would record an allowance at the end of the quarter in which the loans were acquired.\nRefer to Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section below for the Company's quarterly assessment process.\nThe accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due or when, in the opinion of management, reasonable doubt exists as to the full collection of principal and/or interest. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Any reversals of income from previous years are recorded against the allowance for loan losses. When the Company receives a cash interest payment on a non-accrual loan, it is applied as a reduction of the principal balance. Non-accrual loans are returned to accrual status when the borrower becomes current as to principal and interest and has demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance. The amortization of loan fees is discontinued on non-accrual loans and may be considered for write-off. Depending on the terms of the loan, a fee may be charged upon a prepayment which is recognized in the period of the prepayment.\nRestructured loans are considered a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The Company may receive an asset from the debtor in a TDR, but the value of the asset received is typically significantly less than the amount of the debt forgiven. The Company has received equity interest in certain debtors as compensation for reducing the loan principal balance in some cases.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses that is intended to estimate loan losses inherent in its loan portfolio. A provision for loan losses is charged to expense to establish the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level, in the opinion of management, sufficient to offset estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. The appropriateness of the allowance and the allowance components are reviewed quarterly. The Company's estimate of each allowance component is based on observable information and on market and third-party data that the Company believes are reflective of the underlying loan losses being estimated.\nThe Company employs internally developed and third-party estimation tools for measuring credit risk (loan ratings, probability of default, and exposure at default), which are used in developing an appropriate allowance for loan losses. The Company performs periodic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to identify risks and to assess the overall collectability of loans.\nIn accordance with the authoritative guidance under GAAP on loan impairment, any required impairment allowances are included in the allowance for loan losses. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company measures impairment of a loan based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan if the loan is collateral dependent, depending on the circumstances and the Company's collection strategy.\nLoans which are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance. The provision for loan losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance.\nAsset-backed Securities Issued\nABS represent securities issued to third parties by the CLOs. The Company consolidated the CLOs for financial reporting purposes. At the issuance date of the instrument, the Company made a policy election not to update the estimated life of the asset on a prospective basis. This conclusion established at the issuance date, was therefore fixed for the instrument.\nLegal and Other Contingent Liabilities\nWe are involved in various pending and potential claims, arbitrations, legal actions, investigations and proceedings related to our business from time to time. Some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts, including claims for punitive and other special damages. The number of claims, legal actions, investigations and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions like us has been increasing in recent years. We have, after consultation with counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management, recorded estimated losses in accordance with authoritative guidance under GAAP on contingencies, to the extent that a claim may result in a probable loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management and our ultimate liabilities may be materially different. In making these determinations, management considers many factors, including, but not limited to, the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant, the basis and validity of the claim, the likelihood of successful defense against the claim and the potential for, and magnitude of, damages or settlements from such pending and potential claims, legal actions, arbitrations, investigations and proceedings, and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies.\nIf a potential adverse contingency should become probable or resolved for an amount in excess of the established reserves during any period, our results of operations in that period and, in some cases, succeeding periods, could be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, and are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions using a two-step process: (i) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that each tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position; and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nThe Company's policy for recording interest and penalties associated with the tax audits or unrecognized tax benefits, if any, is to record such items as a component of income tax.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements affecting the Company, refer to Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Form 10-K contains an overview of the company's operations and financial performance.

In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company adopted this standard using a modified retrospective approach and the new revenue standard was applied prospectively in the Company's financial statements. The Company reported financial information for historical comparable periods that was not revised and will continue to report those historical periods under the accounting standards that were in effect then. The new standard does not apply to revenue from financial instruments, including loans and securities, and as a result, it did not have an impact on revenues closely associated with financial instruments, including principal transactions, interest income, and interest expenses. The new standard primarily impacts the presentation of our investment banking revenues, specifically underwriting revenues, strategic advisory revenues, and private placement fees. Certain investment banking revenues have historically been presented net of related expenses. Under the new standard, revenues and expenses related to investment banking transactions are presented gross in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For investment banking and asset management revenues, the Company has separately described the accounting policies in effect during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For additional information, see Note 3.\nThe Election for JMP Group LLC to be Taxed as a Corporation\nSince January 2015, JMP Group LLC has been a publicly traded partnership and, as such, has been taxed as a partnership, and not as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income.\u201d On January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than a partnership, going forward. The Company expects this election will be retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019. As a partnership, the Company has previously been treated as a disregarded entity for tax purposes and has only paid taxes on a few taxable corporate holding subsidiaries.\nAn entity taxed as a partnership generally does not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability, and any income, gains, losses or deductions are taken in by the owners of the partnership in computing their U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of any distributions from the partnership. In contrast, an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally pays U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income as it is considered a taxable entity. For years beginning after December 31, 2017, the maximum U.S. federal tax rate imposed on the net income of corporations is 21%. This rate may be subject to change in the future. Owners of a corporate entity generally do not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability on any earnings of the corporation unless the corporation makes a distribution of cash or property. Any distributions paid from current or accumulated earnings are treated as dividends, and these \"qualifying dividends\" are generally taxed at a lower rate than the ordinary income tax rate. Any distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings are treated as nontaxable returns of capital which reduce the owner's tax basis in the corporation. Any remaining excess is treated as capital gain. For corporate entities, as both the corporation and distributions from the corporation are taxed, there are two levels of potential tax on the income earned.\nOverview\nThe Company, is a diversified capital markets firm headquartered in San Francisco, California. We have a diversified business model with a focus on small and middle-market companies and provide:\n \u2022 investment banking services, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and other strategic advisory services, to corporate clients; \n \u2022 sales and trading and related securities brokerage services to institutional investors; \n \u2022 equity research coverage of four target industries; \n \u2022 asset management products and services to institutional investors, high net-worth individuals and for our own account; and \n \u2022 management of collateralized loan obligations and a specialty finance company. \nComponents of Revenues\nWe derive revenues primarily from: fees from our investment banking business, net commissions from our sales and trading business, management fees and incentive fees from our asset management business, and interest income earned on collateralized loan obligations we manage. We also generate revenues from principal transactions, interest, dividends and other income.\nInvestment Banking\nWe earn investment banking revenues from underwriting securities offerings, arranging private capital markets transactions and providing advisory services in mergers and acquisitions and other strategic transactions.\nUnderwriting Revenues\nWe earn revenues from securities offerings in which we act as an underwriter, such as initial public offerings and follow-on equity offerings. Underwriting revenues include management fees, underwriting fees, selling concessions, and realized and unrealized net gains and losses on equity positions held in inventory for a period of time to facilitate the completion of certain underwritten offerings. We record underwriting revenues, gross of related syndicate expenses, on the trade date which is typically the date of pricing an offering (or the following day). The Company has determined that its performance obligations are completed and the related income is reasonably determinable on the trade date. In syndicated transactions, management estimates our share of transaction-related expenses incurred by the syndicate, and we recognize revenues gross of such expense. On final settlement by the lead manager, typically 90 days from the trade date of the transaction, we adjust these amounts to reflect the actual transaction-related expenses and our resulting underwriting fee. We receive a higher proportion of total fees in underwritten transactions in which we act as a lead manager.\nStrategic Advisory Revenues\nOur strategic advisory revenues primarily consist of success fees received upon the closing of mergers and acquisitions but also include retainer fees received when we are first engaged to provide advisory services. We also earn fees for related advisory work and other services, such as fairness opinions, valuation analyses, due diligence, and pre-transaction structuring advice. These revenues may be earned for providing services to either the buyer or the seller involved in a transaction. Depending on the nature of the engagement letter and the agreed upon services, customers may simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of services or services may culminate in the delivery of the advisory services at a point in time. The Company evaluates each contract individually and the performance obligations identified to determine if revenue should be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement or at a specific point in time. Any retainer fees received in connection with these agreements are individually evaluated and any unearned fees are deferred for revenue recognition.\nPrivate Capital Markets and Other Revenues\nWe earn fees for private capital markets and other services in connection with transactions that are not underwritten, such as private placements of equity securities, private investments in public equity ( PIPE\u201d) transactions and Rule 144A offerings. We record private placement revenues on the closing date of these transactions. Client reimbursements for costs associated for private placement fees are recorded gross within Investment banking and various expense captions, excluding compensation.\nSince our investment banking revenues are generally recognized at the time of completion of a transaction or the services to be performed, these revenues typically vary between periods and may be affected considerably by the timing of the closing of significant transactions.\nBrokerage Revenues\nOur brokerage revenues include trading commissions paid by customers for purchases or sales of exchange-listed and over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) equity securities. Commissions resulting from equity securities transactions executed on behalf of customers are recorded on a trade date basis. The Company believes that the performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer. Brokerage revenues also include net trading gains and losses that result from market-making activities and from our commitment of capital to facilitate customer transactions. Our brokerage revenues may vary between periods, in part depending on commission rates, trading volumes and our ability to deliver equity research and other value-added services to our clients. The ability to execute trades electronically, through the Internet and through other alternative trading systems, has increased pressure on trading commissions and spreads across our industry. We expect this trend toward alternative trading systems and the related pricing pressure in the brokerage business to continue. We are, to some extent, compensated through brokerage commissions for the equity research and other value-added services we deliver to our clients. These soft dollar\u201d practices have been the subject of discussion among regulators, the investment banking community and our sales and trading clients. In particular, commission sharing arrangements have been adopted by some large institutional investors. In these arrangements, an institutional investor concentrates its trading with fewer execution\u201d brokers and pays a fixed amount for execution, with a designated amount set aside for payments to other firms for research or other brokerage services. Accordingly, trading volume directed to us by investors that enter into such arrangements may be reduced, or eliminated, but we may be compensated for our research and sales efforts through allocations of the designated amounts. Depending on the extent to which we agree to this practice and depending on our ability to enter into arrangements on terms acceptable to us, this trend would likely impair the revenues and profitability of our brokerage business by negatively affecting both volumes and trading commissions.\nAsset Management Fees\nWe earn asset management fees for managing a family of investment partnerships, including hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, and private equity funds, a real estate fund, a capital debt fund, as well as a publicly traded specialty finance company, HCC. These fees include base management fees and incentive fees. Base management fees are generally determined by the fair value of the assets under management (\"AUM\") or the aggregate capital commitment and the fee schedule for each fund or account. Incentive fees are based upon the investment performance of the funds or accounts. For most of our funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the excess investment return above a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined period of time. For private equity funds, incentive fees equate to a percentage of the realized gain from the disposition of each portfolio investment in which each investor participates, which we earn after returning contributions by an investor for a portfolio investment. Some of these incentive fees are subject to contingent repayments to investors or clawback and cannot be recognized until it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. Any such fees earned are deferred for revenue recognition until the contingency is removed or the Company determines that it is not probable that a significant reversal of revenue will occur. Generally, we do not earn management fees calculated on the basis of average AUM.\nAs of December 31, 2018 the contractual base management fees earned from each of our investment funds or companies ranged between 1% and 2% of AUM or were between 1% and 2% of aggregate committed capital. The contractual incentive fees were generally 20%, subject to high-water marks, for the hedge funds; 5% to 20%, subject to high-water marks or a performance hurdle rate, for the hedge funds of funds; 20%, subject to high-water marks, for Harvest Growth Capital LLC ( HGC\u201d) and Harvest Growth Capital II LLC ( HGC II\u201d); and 30% for JMP Capital I LLC (\"JMP Capital I\"). Our asset management revenues are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors that are unpredictable, including the overall condition of the economy, the securities markets as a whole and our core sectors. These market and industry conditions can have a material effect on the inflows and outflows of AUM and on the performance of our asset management funds. For example, a significant portion of the performance-based or incentive fee revenues that we recognize are based on the value of securities held in the funds we manage. The value of these securities includes unrealized gains or losses that may change from one period to another.\nThe Company sold the general partnership interest in the Harvest Small Cap Partners (\"HSCP\") fund entities to a newly formed entity owned by the portfolio manager of the HSCP funds. The sale closed on December 31, 2018 upon which the Company's investment management contracts with the HSCP funds terminated. As a result, the Company's AUM decreased by $365.7 million on January 1, 2019. As part of the sale, the Company will receive contingent revenue generated by these funds over the next five years, subject to a limit on the total contingent revenue. These trailer fees will be recognized as other income.\nAsset management fees for the CLOs we manage currently consist only of senior and subordinated base management fees. We recognize base management fees for the CLOs on a monthly basis over the period during which the collateral management services are performed. The base management fees for the CLOs are calculated as a percentage of the average aggregate collateral balances for a specified period. As we consolidate the CLO's, the management fees earned at JMPCA are eliminated on consolidation in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO I and CLO II were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO III were 0.35% and 0.33%, respectively, of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO IV warehouse portfolio were 1.0% of the average collateral balance. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO IV, after securitization, were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO V warehouse portfolio were 1.0% of the average equity contributions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO V, after securitization, were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO VI warehouse portfolio were 1.0% of the average equity contributions.\nThe redemption provisions of our hedge funds require at least 60 to 90 days' advance notice. Redemptions are not permitted in our private equity funds or our private debt capital vehicles. The redemption provisions do not apply to the CLOs.\nThe following tables present certain information with respect to the investment funds managed by HCS, JMPAM, HCAP Advisors, and JMPCA:\n\n (1) For hedge funds, funds of funds, HGC, HGC II, Harvest Intrexon Enterprise Fund, and Other, AUM represent the net assets of such funds. For JMP Realty Partners I and JMP Capital I, assets under management represent the commitment amount. For JMP Realty Partners I the commitment amount is subject to the management fee calculation. For CLOs, AUM represent the sum of the aggregate collateral balance and restricted cash to be reinvested in collateral, upon which management fees are earned. (2) The Company sold the general partnership interest in the HSCP fund entities to a newly formed entity owned by the portfolio manager of the HSCP funds. The sale closed on December 31, 2018 upon which the Company's investment management contracts with the HSCP funds terminated. As a result, the Company's AUM decreased by $365.7 million on January 1, 2019. As part of the sale, the Company will receive contingent revenue generated by these funds over the next five years, subject to a limit on the total contingent revenue. (3) Harvest Agriculture Select ( HAS\u201d) includes managed accounts in which the Company has neither equity investment nor control. These are included as they follow the respective funds' strategy and earn fees. (4) JMP Masters Fund began the process of liquidation on December 31, 2015. (5) CLO III, CLO IV, CLO V (effective July 26, 2018), CLO V warehouse (through July 26, 2018), and CLO VI warehouse (effective October 18, 2019) were consolidated in the Company's Statements of Financial Condition for the year ended December 31, 2018. CLO III, CLO IV, and CLO V warehouse were consolidated in the Company's Statements of Financial Condition for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>The Company sold the general partnership interest in the HSCP fund entities to a newly formed entity owned by the portfolio manager of the HSCP funds.

In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.\nImpact of Adopting Revenue Recognition Guidance\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, and clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The Company adopted this standard using a modified retrospective approach and the new revenue standard was applied prospectively in the Company's financial statements. The Company reported financial information for historical comparable periods that was not revised and will continue to report those historical periods under the accounting standards that were in effect then. The new standard does not apply to revenue from financial instruments, including loans and securities, and as a result, it did not have an impact on revenues closely associated with financial instruments, including principal transactions, interest income, and interest expenses. The new standard primarily impacts the presentation of our investment banking revenues, specifically underwriting revenues, strategic advisory revenues, and private placement fees. Certain investment banking revenues have historically been presented net of related expenses. Under the new standard, revenues and expenses related to investment banking transactions are presented gross in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For investment banking and asset management revenues, the Company has separately described the accounting policies in effect during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For additional information, see Note 3.\nThe Election for JMP Group LLC to be Taxed as a Corporation\nSince January 2015, JMP Group LLC has been a publicly traded partnership and, as such, has been taxed as a partnership, and not as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income.\u201d On January 31, 2019, the Company filed an election with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes, rather than a partnership, going forward. The Company expects this election will be retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019. As a partnership, the Company has previously been treated as a disregarded entity for tax purposes and has only paid taxes on a few taxable corporate holding subsidiaries.\nAn entity taxed as a partnership generally does not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability, and any income, gains, losses or deductions are taken in by the owners of the partnership in computing their U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of any distributions from the partnership. In contrast, an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally pays U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income as it is considered a taxable entity. For years beginning after December 31, 2017, the maximum U.S. federal tax rate imposed on the net income of corporations is 21%. This rate may be subject to change in the future. Owners of a corporate entity generally do not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability on any earnings of the corporation unless the corporation makes a distribution of cash or property. Any distributions paid from current or accumulated earnings are treated as dividends, and these \"qualifying dividends\" are generally taxed at a lower rate than the ordinary income tax rate. Any distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings are treated as nontaxable returns of capital which reduce the owner's tax basis in the corporation. Any remaining excess is treated as capital gain. For corporate entities, as both the corporation and distributions from the corporation are taxed, there are two levels of potential tax on the income earned.\nOverview\nThe Company, is a diversified capital markets firm headquartered in San Francisco, California. We have a diversified business model with a focus on small and middle-market companies and provide:\n \u2022 investment banking services, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and other strategic advisory services, to corporate clients; \n \u2022 sales and trading and related securities brokerage services to institutional investors; \n \u2022 equity research coverage of four target industries; \n \u2022 asset management products and services to institutional investors, high net-worth individuals and for our own account; and \n \u2022 management of collateralized loan obligations and a specialty finance company. \nComponents of Revenues\nWe derive revenues primarily from: fees from our investment banking business, net commissions from our sales and trading business, management fees and incentive fees from our asset management business, and interest income earned on collateralized loan obligations we manage.
