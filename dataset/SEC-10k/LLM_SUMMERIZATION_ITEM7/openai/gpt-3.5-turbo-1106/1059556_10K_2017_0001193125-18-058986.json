See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d commencing on page 58 and Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d commencing on page 18 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.\nTHE COMPANY\nMoody's is a provider of (i) credit ratings; (ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools; (iii) software solutions that support financial risk management activities; (iv) quantitatively derived credit scores; (v) financial services training and certification services; (vi) offshore financial research and analytical services; and (vii) company information and business intelligence products. Moody's reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA.\nMIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations which consist primarily of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA's non-ratings operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.\nThe MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit-related events. The RD&A business also produces economic research and data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores as well as business intelligence and company information products. Within its ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The PS business provides offshore research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nMoody's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody's to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody's evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets (including the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets), pension and other retirement benefits and UTBs. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management's judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.\nPursuant to ASC Topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nThe Company's products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company's control. In instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or, if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price. In instances where the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history, the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASC Topic 605, when the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.\nIn the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, structured credit, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which was approximately 24 years on a weighted average basis at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $140.1 million, $133.0 million, and $121.0 million.\nMultiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. In instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company generally uses ESP in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely provides initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings.\nMIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers' most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, accounts receivable included approximately $27.0 million, $25.0 million, and $24.0 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, accounts receivable included approximately $185.0 million, $159.1 million, and $146.4 million, respectively, relating to accrued annual monitoring service revenue.\nIn the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.\nProducts and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.\nIf the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nresidual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation services are considered essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d), once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized over the coverage period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period. If VSOE does not exist for PCS at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation, revenue not recognized due to the absence of VSOE will be recognized on a cumulative basis.\nAccounts Receivable Allowance\nMoody's records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are charged against the allowance. Moody's evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and invoice adjustment experience as well as the current aging status of customer accounts. Moody's also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody's adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody's results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the Company's consolidated results of operations.\nContingencies\nAccounting for contingencies, including those matters described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management's best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.\nFor claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, but discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.\nThe Company's wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker's compensation, employment practices litigation, employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nrelated to professional liability claims. For matters insured by the Company's insurance subsidiary, Moody's records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion. The Company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management's best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates. Defense costs for matters not self-insured by the Company's wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided.\nFor income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nAs of July 31 of each year, Moody's evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.\nThe Company has seven primary reporting units: two within the Company's ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody's other ratings operations) and five reporting units within MA: RD&A, ERS, FSTC, MAKS and Bureau van Dijk. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The ERS reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry. These products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis. The FSTC reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services. The MAKS reporting unit provides offshore research and analytical services. The Bureau van Dijk reporting unit consists of the newly acquired Bureau van Dijk business, which was acquired on August 10, 2017, and primarily provides business intelligence and company information products.\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments. For the reporting units where the Company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the Company's accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. At July 31, 2017, the Company performed a qualitative assessment on all reporting units except for MAKS, which resulted in no indicators of impairment of goodwill.\nIn January 2017 there was a management change in the MAKS business. A quantitative impairment assessment for the MAKS reporting unit was performed as of July 31, 2017 to reflect the completion of a new strategic plan for this reporting unit under new management (the Company's annual strategic plan is completed in the third quarter of each year). This quantitative assessment resulted in no impairment of goodwill for the MAKS reporting unit at July 31, 2017.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and appropriate comparable market metrics. However, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates. In addition, the Company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.\nOther assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSensitivity Analyses and Key Assumptions for Deriving the Fair Value of a Reporting Unit\nThe following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of December 31, 2017 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350, assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sensitivity Analysis </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Deficit Caused by a Hypothetical Reduction to Fair Value </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>MIS </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>RD&A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ERS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FSTC </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>MAKS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ICRA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bureau van Dijk* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,684.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,753.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70.2 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>* </td> <td>Bureau van Dijk was acquired subsequent to the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment as of July 31, 2017.

Additionally, the Company has not completed its allocation of certain of the goodwill acquired to other MA reporting units that are anticipated to benefit from synergies resulting from the Bureau van Dijk acquisition. </td> </tr>\n</table> Methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining of the fair value of reporting units:\nThe following is a discussion regarding the Company's methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding ICRA, as of the date of each reporting unit's last quantitative assessment (July 31, 2017 for MAKS; July 31, 2016 for the remaining reporting units). As ICRA is a publicly traded company in India, the Company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization.\nThe fair value of each reporting unit, excluding ICRA, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. The DCF analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Company's financial position and results of operations. Moody's allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition.\nThe sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and WACC assumptions described below are as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit. The following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\u00bb </td> <td> </td> <td>Future cash flow assumptions-The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. These projections are consistent with the Company's operating and strategic plan. Cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets, new customer acquisition and new products. Beyond five years, a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on expected inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units. For all reporting units, a 10% decrease in the revenue growth rates used would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\u00bb </td> <td> </td> <td>WACC-The WACC is the rate used to discount each reporting unit's estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is based on a risk-free interest rate, an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit's cash flows. The cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the Company's outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 8.5% to 10.5%. Differences in the WACC used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting units whereby an increase in the WACC of one percentage point would not result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no such events or changes during 2017 that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the Company's reporting units may not be recoverable. This determination was made based on continued growth, consistent with operating and strategic plans for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides.\nPension and Other Retirement Benefits\nThe expenses, assets and liabilities that Moody's reports for its Retirement Plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These significant assumptions include the following:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\u00bb </td> <td> </td> <td>future compensation increases are based on the Company's long-term actual experience and future outlook; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\u00bb </td> <td> </td> <td>long-term expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan's portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments); and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\u00bb </td> <td> </td> <td>discount rates are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds. </td> </tr>\n</table> The discount rates used to measure the present value of the Company's benefit obligation for its Retirement Plans as of December 31, 2017 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares each plan's projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank pension discount curve. The cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.\nMoody's major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with third-party actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company's Retirement Plans. Additionally, the Company has updated its mortality assumption by adopting the newly released mortality improvement scale MP-2017 to accompany the RP-2014 mortality tables to reflect the latest information regarding future mortality expectations by the Society of Actuaries.\nWhen actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. Excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets, the Company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. For Moody's Retirement Plans, the total actuarial losses as of December 31, 2017 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $123.2 million, and Moody's expects to recognize a net periodic expense of $6.0 million in 2018 related to the amortization of actuarial losses.\nFor Moody's funded U.S. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under ASC Topic 715, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets' component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has an unrecognized asset loss of $16.1 million, of which $2.1 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets' component of 2019 expense.\nThe table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody's 2018 income before provision for income taxes. These effects have been calculated using the Company's current projections of 2018 expenses, assets and liabilities related to Moody's Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>Assumption Used for 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Impact on\n2018 income before provision\nfor income taxes\n(Decrease)/Increase </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted Average Discount Rates* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.46%/3.45% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.71% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Assumed Long-Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>* </td> <td>Weighted average discount rates of 3.46% and 3.45% for pension plans and Other Retirement Plans, respectively. </td> </tr>\n</table> A one percentage-point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2018 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to Retirement Plans will be approximately $31 million in 2018, a decrease compared to the $32.6 million recognized in 2017.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company's tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.\nThe Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for UTBs. The Company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses.\nFor UTBs, ASC Topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to UTBs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the Company's operating results or financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law which resulted in significant changes to U.S. corporate tax laws. The Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time deemed repatriation tax (\u201ctransition tax\u201d) on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Due to the complexities involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, in 2017 the Company recorded a provisional estimate of $247.3 million related to the transition tax. A portion of this amount will be payable over eight years, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest. Also in 2017, a provisional estimate of $56.2 million was recorded decreasing net deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. The above provisional estimates may be impacted by a number of additional considerations, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations and our ongoing analysis of the new law.\nOther Estimates\nIn addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moody's consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, valuation of investments in affiliates and the estimated lives of amortizable intangible assets. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody's consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moody's consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moody's.\nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nThe Company is organized into two reportable segments at December 31, 2017: MIS and MA.\nThe MIS segment is comprised primarily of all of the Company's ratings operations consisting of five LOBs-CFG, SFG, FIG, PPIF and MIS Other. The ratings LOBs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. The MIS Other LOB consists of certain non-ratings operations managed by MIS which consists of non-rating revenue from ICRA and fixed income pricing service operations in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets as well as serving as provider of business intelligence and company information. The MA segment consists of three lines of business-RD&A, ERS and PS. The results of operations for MA and revenue for the RD&A LOB for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 include the financial results from Bureau van Dijk which was acquired on August 10, 2017.\nThe following is a discussion of the results of operations of the Company and its reportable segments. Total MIS revenue and total MA expenses include the intersegment royalty revenue for MIS and expense charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. The royalty rate charged by MIS approximates the fair value of the aforementioned content, data and products developed by MIS. Total MA revenue and total MIS expenses include intersegment fees charged to MIS from MA for the\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nuse of certain MA products and services in MIS's ratings process. These fees charged by MA are generally equal to the costs incurred by MA to provide these products and services. Overhead charges and corporate expenses that exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company that benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenue-split methodology. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and information technology.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2017, in conjunction with the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk, the Company modified its definition of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS to exclude the impact of amortization of all acquisition-related intangible assets.

Additionally, the increase over prior year reflects benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were partially offset by lower U.S. public finance refunding volumes.\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $196.9 million increase in MA revenue primarily reflects higher RD&A revenue across all regions driven by growth in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data as well as the contribution from the Bureau van Dijk acquisition of approximately $92 million (net of an approximate $36 million reduction relating to a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting as further described in Note 7 to the financial statements).\nTransaction revenue accounted for 50% of global MCO revenue in 2017, compared to 49% in 2016.\nU.S. revenue of $2,348.4 million in 2017 increased $242.9 million over the prior year, reflecting growth in both reportable segments.\nNon-U.S. revenue increased $357.0 million from 2016 reflecting growth in both reportable segments.\nOperating expenses were $1,222.8 million in 2017, up $196.2 million from 2016, primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation expenses (including annual bonuses, a profit sharing contribution and performance-based equity compensation), which is correlated with the strong financial performance of the Company in 2017. This increase also reflects higher salaries and employee benefit expenses resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases and increases in headcount coupled with Bureau van Dijk expenses.\nSG&A expenses of $991.4 million in 2017 increased $55.0 million from the prior year period primarily due to higher performance-based compensation costs (including annual bonuses, a profit sharing contribution and performance-based equity compensation), which is correlated with the strong financial performance of the Company in 2017 coupled with Bureau van Dijk expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of cost management initiatives implemented in 2016 that have benefited 2017 as well as lower legal costs.\nD&A increased $31.6 million primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the Bureau van Dijk acquisition.\nAcquisition-Related Expenses represent expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk.\nOperating income of $1,809.1 million increased $1,170.4 million from 2016. Operating margin was 43.0% compared to 17.7% in 2016. Operating income and operating margin in 2016 were suppressed by the $863.8 million Settlement Charge. Adjusted Operating Income was $1,989.9 million in 2017, an increase of $348.7 million compared to 2016. Adjusted Operating Margin of 47.3% increased 180 BPS compared to the prior year.\nInterest (expense) income, net in 2017 was $(188.4) million, a $50.6 million increase in expense compared to 2016 primarily due to: i) interest on the 2017 Senior Notes and 2017 Floating Rate Senior Notes which were issued in the first quarter of 2017 to fund the payment of the 2016 Settlement Charge and repayment of the Series 2007-1 Notes; ii) interest on the 2017 Private Placement Notes Due 2023 and 2028 both issued in June 2017 coupled with interest on the 2017 Term Loan drawn down in August 2017, all of which were issued to fund the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk; and iii) fees on the undrawn 2017 Bridge Credit Facility also related to the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk.\nOther non-operating (expense) income, net was $(4.7) million in 2017, a $61.8 million change compared to 2016 primarily reflecting approximately $17 million in FX losses in 2017 compared to approximately $50 million in FX gains in the prior year. The FX gains in 2016 included an approximate $35 million gain related to the liquidation of a non-U.S. subsidiary.\nAdditionally, Moody's recognized the $59.7 million CCXI Gain and the $111.1 million Purchase Price Hedge Gain in 2017.\nThe ETR of 43.6% in 2017 includes a net charge of approximately $246 million in the fourth quarter related to the impacts of corporate tax reform in the U.S. and Belgium partially offset by the non-taxable CCXI Gain and an approximate $40 million benefit reflecting the adoption on a prospective basis of a new accounting standard relating to Excess Tax Benefits on stock-based compensation. In accordance with a new accounting standard, these Excess Tax Benefits are now recorded to the provision for income taxes, whereas in the prior year were recorded to capital surplus (refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this new accounting standard). The 2016 ETR of 50.6% included the non-deductible nature of the federal portion of the Settlement Charge. The impact of the aforementioned tax reform in the U.S. is expected to reduce the Company's ETR in years subsequent to 2017. For the full-year ended December 31, 2018, the Company expects the ETR to be between 22% and 23%.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDiluted EPS increased $3.79 compared to 2016.

expenses:\nGlobal MIS revenue of $2,773.8 million in 2017 was up 17% compared to 2016, most notably from strong leveraged finance rated issuance volumes within CFG coupled with strong growth in banking-related revenue in FIG and increases across most asset classes in SFG. Also contributing to the growth was the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases.\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransaction revenue for MIS was 65% in 2017 compared to 61% in 2016.\nIn the U.S., revenue was $1,702.8 million in 2017, an increase of $200.9 million or 13%, compared to 2016 primarily reflecting strong growth in CFG, SFG and FIG revenue being partially offset by declines in PPIF and MIS Other revenue.\nNon-U.S. revenue was $1,071.0 million in 2017, an increase of $202.1 million or 23%, compared to 2016 reflecting growth across all LOBs excluding MIS Other.\nGlobal CFG revenue of $1,392.7 million in 2017 was up 24% compared to 2016 primarily due to strength in leveraged finance issuance in the U.S., EMEA and Asia-Pacific as issuers took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance obligations and fund M&A activity. The growth in leveraged finance revenue also reflects benefits from a favorable issuance mix in 2017 compared to the prior year where issuance volumes included a greater number of lower-yielding jumbo deals. The increase over the prior year also reflects higher investment-grade corporate debt revenue in the U.S. reflecting continued favorable market conditions and benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as growth in monitoring fees across all regions. Transaction revenue represented 73% of total CFG revenue in 2017, compared to 68% in the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue was $909.7 million, or 19% higher compared to the prior year. Internationally, revenue of $483.0 million increased 34% compared to the prior year.\nGlobal SFG revenue of $495.5 million in 2017 increased $58.7 million, or 13%, compared to 2016. In the U.S., revenue of $340.1 million increased $46.8 million over 2016 primarily due to strong growth in CLO issuance reflecting an increase in bank loan supply and favorable market conditions which enabled both new securitizations and a surge in refinancing activity. Non-U.S. revenue in 2017 of $155.4 million increased $11.9 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth across most asset classes in the EMEA region. Transaction revenue was 65% of total SFG revenue in 2017 compared to 62% in the prior year.\nGlobal FIG revenue of $435.8 million in 2017 increased $66.9 million, or 18%, compared to 2016. In the U.S., revenue of $186.1 million increased $26.0 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher issuance in the banking sector and benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and price increases. Internationally, revenue was $249.7 million in 2017, up $40.9 million compared to 2016 primarily due to higher banking revenue in EMEA from opportunistic issuance amidst current favorable market conditions as well as benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. The non-U.S. growth also reflects strength in banking revenue in the Asia-Pacific region reflecting higher cross-border issuance from Chinese banks and the non-bank financial sector. Transaction revenue was 45% of total FIG revenue in 2017 compared to 37% in 2016.\nGlobal PPIF revenue was $431.3 million in 2017 and increased $19.1 million, or 5%, compared to 2016. In the U.S., revenue in 2017 was $266.4 million and decreased $9.8 million compared to 2016 primarily due to strong PFG refunding volumes in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by growth in infrastructure finance revenue coupled with benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue was $164.9 million and increased $28.9 million compared to 2016 reflecting strong growth in infrastructure finance revenue in the Asia-Pacific region and growth in public finance revenue in EMEA. Transaction revenue was 65% of total PPIF revenue in 2017 compared to 63% in the prior year.\nOperating and SG&A expenses in 2017 increased $128.8 million compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in performance-based compensation resulting from strong financial performance in 2017 coupled with increased headcount and higher salaries and employee benefits costs reflecting annual compensation increases. These increases were partially offset by lower legal fees and continued cost control initiatives.\nAdjusted Operating Income and operating income in 2017, which includes intersegment royalty revenue and intersegment expenses, were $1,638.6 million and $1,563.9 million, respectively, and increased $283.2 million and $1,156.3 million, respectively, compared to 2016. Adjusted Operating Margin was 56.8% or 190 BPS higher than the prior year. Operating margin was 54.2% in 2017 compared to 16.5% in the prior year. Operating income and operating margin in 2016 were suppressed due to the Settlement Charge.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2016 primarily due to growth in RD&A (which included approximately $92 million in revenue, or 7 percentage points of the growth, from the Bureau van Dijk acquisition) coupled with growth in ERS, which included revenue from the first quarter 2016 acquisition of GGY. Additionally, the growth over the prior year reflects benefits from higher fees within MA's recurring revenue base due to enhanced content and continued alignment of usage and licensing parameters. Recurring revenue comprised 78% and 75% of total MA revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn the U.S., revenue of $645.6 million in 2017 increased $42.0 million, and reflected growth across all LOBs.\nNon-U.S. revenue of $784.7 million in 2017 was $154.9 million higher than in 2016 reflecting growth in RD&A, which included approximately $82 million in non-U.S. Bureau van Dijk revenue, and higher ERS revenue.\nGlobal RD&A revenue of $832.7 million, which comprised 58% and 54% of total external MA revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively, increased $165.1 million, or 25%, over the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue of $424.4 million increased $35.1 million compared to 2016. Non-U.S. revenue of $408.3 million increased $130.0 million compared to the prior year. RD&A revenue in 2017 included approximately $92 million in revenue, or 14 percentage points of the growth, from the Bureau van Dijk acquisition (net of an approximate $36 million reduction relating to a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting as further described in Note 7 to the financial statements). RD&A revenue growth also reflects strong results in the credit research and rating data feeds product lines, where enhanced content and continued alignment of usage and licensing parameters have generated higher fees.\nGlobal ERS revenue of $448.6 million in 2017 increased $29.8 million, or 7%, over 2016. The growth is primarily due to higher revenue from risk and finance analytics products coupled with incremental revenue from GGY, which was acquired in March 2016. Additionally, the revenue growth reflects benefits from pricing increases within ERS's recurring revenue base. Revenue in ERS is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of software implementation and license revenue in a relatively small number of engagements. In the U.S., revenue of $166.6 million increased $3.7 million compared to the prior year. Non-U.S. revenue of $282.0 million increased $26.1 million compared to the prior year.\nGlobal PS revenue of $149.0 million in 2017 increased 1% compared to 2016 reflecting higher revenue from analytical and research services in the U.S. mostly offset by lower revenue from these services internationally. In the U.S., revenue in 2017 was $54.6 million, up 6% compared to 2016. International revenue was $94.4 million, down 1% compared to 2016.\nOperating and SG&A expenses in 2017 increased $122.4 million compared to 2016. The expense growth includes an approximate $74 million increase in compensation costs reflecting $32 million in Bureau van Dijk compensation costs coupled with annual salary\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nincreases, higher performance-based compensation and higher severance costs partially offset by the impact of cost control initiatives. Non-compensation costs increased approximately $48 million primarily due to Bureau van Dijk expenses.\nThere were $22.5 million in Acquisition-Related Expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $30.7 million primarily due to the amortization of Bureau van Dijk's intangible assets.\nAdjusted Operating Income was $351.3 million in 2017 and increased $65.5 million compared to the same period in 2016. Operating income of $245.2 million in 2017 increased $14.1 million compared to the same period in 2016. Adjusted Operating Margin in 2017 was 24.3%, up 140BPS from 2016. Operating margin was 17.0% in 2017, down 150BPS from the prior year reflecting the aforementioned $22.5 million in Bureau van Dijk Acquisition-Related Expenses coupled with approximately $31 million of higher D&A primarily relating to Bureau van Dijk's intangible assets.

These increases were mostly offset by challenges in the first half of 2016 in the high-yield and investment-grade corporate debt sectors due to elevated credit spreads and market volatility. Additionally, there was lower securitization activity in the U.S. in the first half of 2016, most notably in the U.S. CLO and CMBS asset classes, which reflected the aforementioned elevated credit spreads and market volatility as well as uncertainty relating to the implementation of risk retention regulatory requirements for these asset classes. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00bb </td> <td> </td> <td>MA revenue grew 7% compared to the prior year reflecting growth in ERS and RD&A, most notably in the U.S. Revenue grew in most product areas of ERS and included revenue from the acquisition of GGY.

The growth also reflected benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were mostly offset by challenges in the first half of 2016 in the high-yield and investment-grade corporate debt sectors due to elevated credit spreads and market volatility.

In RD&A, revenue growth was primarily driven by credit research, subscriptions and licensing of ratings data partially offset by the impact of unfavorable changes in FX rates. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX translation rates, MA revenue grew 10%.\nTransaction revenue accounted for 49% of global MCO revenue in 2016 compared 50% of global MCO revenue in 2015.\nU.S. revenue of $2,105.5 million in 2016 increased $96.5 million over the prior year, reflecting strong growth in MA coupled with modest growth in MIS.\nNon-U.S. revenue increased $23.2 million from 2015 reflecting modest growth in both reportable segments.\nOperating expenses were $1,026.6 million in 2016 up $50.3 million from 2015 and included an increase in compensation costs of approximately $71 million. This increase reflects higher salaries and employee benefit expenses resulting from the impact of annual compensation increases and headcount growth in MA which includes headcount from the acquisition of GGY. The increase in compensation expenses also reflects higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement relative to targeted results compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by an approximate $21 million decrease in non-compensation expenses reflecting cost reduction initiatives in response to challenging business conditions in MIS earlier in the year.\nSG&A expenses of $936.4 million in 2016 increased $15.1 million from the prior year period reflecting increased compensation costs primarily due to annual compensation increases company-wide and headcount growth in MA which included headcount from the GGY acquisition. The increase in compensation expenses also reflects higher incentive compensation reflecting greater achievement relative to targeted results compared to the prior year. Additionally, there was an increase in non-compensation expenses reflecting higher rent and occupancy costs being mostly offset by the impact of cost reduction initiatives in response to challenging business conditions in MIS earlier in the year.\nThe restructuring charge of $12.0 million relates to cost management initiatives in 2016 in the MIS segment as well as in certain corporate overhead functions.\nD&A increased $13.2 million reflecting amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions as well as higher depreciation reflecting an increase in capital expenditures to support IT infrastructure and business growth.\nThe $863.8 million Settlement Charge relates to an agreement with the U.S. DOJ and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to resolve pending and potential civil claims related to the MIS segment.\nOperating income of $638.7 million in 2016, which included the aforementioned $863.8 million Settlement Charge, was down $834.7 million compared to 2015 and resulted in an operating margin of 17.7%, compared to 42.3% in the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income of $1,641.2 million in 2016 was up modestly compared to 2015, while Adjusted Operating Margin of 45.5% remained flat compared to 2015.\nInterest expense, net in 2016 was ($137.8) million, a $22.7 million increase in expense compared to 2015 reflecting interest on the 2015 Senior Notes which were issued in March 2015 as well as interest on the $300 million of additional borrowings under the 2014 Senior Notes (30-Year) in November 2015.\nOther non-operating income, net was $57.1 million in 2016, a $35.8 million increase in income compared to 2015. This increase reflected FX gains of approximately $35 million related to the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary and approximately $15 million of gains relating to the appreciation of the euro relative to the British pound during 2016. FX gains in 2015 were immaterial. This increase in income was partially offset by a $6.4 million benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter in 2015 compared to a $1.6 million benefit in 2016.\nThe ETR was 50.6% in 2016 compared to 31.2% in the prior year with the increase primarily reflecting the non-deductible nature of the federal portion of the aforementioned Settlement Charge.\nNet Income in 2016, which included an approximate $701 million net Settlement Charge more fully described above, was $266.6 million, or $674.7 million lower than prior year. Diluted EPS of $1.36 in 2016, which included: i) a $3.59 Settlement Charge; ii) a $0.04 restructuring charge and iii) an $0.18 FX gain relating to the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary; and iv) $0.13 in Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization, decreased $3.27 compared to 2015. Excluding all of the aforementioned items in 2016 and a $0.03 benefit from a Legacy Tax Matter and $0.11 in Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization in the prior year, Adjusted Diluted EPS of $4.94 in 2016 increased $0.23 primarily reflecting lower diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding reflects share repurchases under the Company's Board authorized share repurchase program partially offset by shares issued under the employee stock-based compensation programs.\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017

expenses:\nGlobal MIS revenue of $2,370.8 million in 2016 was up 2% compared to 2015 reflecting robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt, bank loans and public finance in the second half of 2016 as capital market volatility and elevated credit spreads that hindered issuance in the first half of 2016 subsided. Additionally, the growth reflects the favorable impact of changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were mostly offset by challenges in the first half of 2016 in both the speculative-grade and investment-grade corporate debt sectors due to elevated credit spreads and market volatility at the time coupled with an unfavorable shift in issuance mix for investment-grade corporate debt. Additionally, there was lower securitization activity in the U.S. in the first half of 2016, primarily in the U.S. CLO and CMBS asset classes, which reflected the aforementioned elevated credit spreads and market volatility as well as uncertainty earlier in the year relating to the December 2016 implementation deadline for certain risk retention regulatory requirements for these asset classes.\nTransaction revenue for MIS was 61% in both 2016 and 2015.\nIn the U.S., revenue was $1,501.9 million in 2016, an increase of $27.6 million compared to 2015 and reflected benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases coupled with second half of 2016 growth in rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as strong public finance issuance. These increases were partially offset by lower rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt in the first half of 2016 and a decline in investment-grade corporate debt rated issuance volumes which was most notable in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, there were declines in securitization activity in the CLO and CMBS asset classes within SFG in the first half of 2016.\nNon-U.S. revenue was $868.9 million in 2016, an increase of $9.0 million compared to 2015 primarily reflecting second half of 2016 growth in high-yield corporate debt and bank loans as well as investment-grade corporate debt. This growth in the second half reflected improved market sentiment following volatility in the first half of 2016 as well as the ECB sponsored CSPP providing a ballast to corporate debt issuance in the EMEA region. The growth over the prior year also reflects changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue in the first half of 2016 primarily reflecting declines in investment-grade and high-yield corporate debt across all regions.\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGlobal CFG revenue of $1,122.3 million in 2016 was up 1% compared to 2015. The increase reflects benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases coupled with robust rated issuance volumes for high-yield corporate debt and bank loans in the U.S. and EMEA in the second half of 2016 as capital market volatility and elevated credit spreads that hindered issuance in the first half of 2016 subsided. The increase also reflects higher investment-grade rated issuance volumes in EMEA in the second half of 2016 reflecting additional liquidity in the region resulting from the ECB sponsored CSPP. These increases were partially offset by lower rated issuance volumes in the first half of 2016 for investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate debt across all regions due to elevated credit spreads and capital market volatility at the time. Also, there were lower U.S. investment-grade rated issuance volumes in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflecting an increase in benchmark interest rates immediately following the U.S. presidential election in November. Transaction revenue represented 68% of total CFG revenue in 2016, compared to 69% in the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue in 2016 was $762.9 million, or $10.0 million higher than the prior year. Internationally, revenue of $359.4 million in the 2016 was flat compared to the prior year.\nGlobal SFG revenue of $436.8 million in 2016 decreased $12.3 million, or 3%, compared to 2015. In the U.S., revenue of $293.3 million decreased $18.2 million compared to 2015. This decrease primarily reflected lower CLO formation in the first half of 2016 due to elevated credit spreads and declining availability of collateral for these instruments earlier in the year. Additionally, the decrease reflected lower securitization activity in the CMBS asset class reflecting higher average credit spreads over the course of 2016, particularly in the first quarter, as well as uncertainties relating to the implementation of certain risk retention regulatory requirements for this asset class. These declines were partially offset by benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases. Non-U.S. revenue in 2016 of $143.5 million increased $5.9 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting growth in RMBS and ABS in EMEA. Transaction revenue was 62% of total SFG revenue in 2016 compared to 64% in the prior year.\nGlobal FIG revenue of $368.9 million in 2016 increased $3.3 million, or 1%, compared to 2015. In the U.S., revenue of $160.1 million increased $3.7 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as higher M&A related issuance volumes in the insurance sector. These increases were partially offset by reduced banking-related issuance volumes due to market volatility in the first half of 2016. Internationally, revenue was $208.8 million in 2016, or flat compared to 2015 with benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases and growth in the Asia-Pacific region reflecting higher cross-border issuance from Chinese banks and asset managers being offset by declines in banking-related issuance in EMEA. Transaction revenue was 37% of total FIG revenue in both 2016 and 2015.\nGlobal PPIF revenue was $412.2 million in 2016 and increased $35.8 million, or 10%, compared to 2015. In the U.S., revenue in 2016 was $276.2 million and increased $31.5 million compared to 2015 primarily due to benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as strong growth in public finance issuance in the second half of 2016. This growth in issuance reflects opportunistic refunding activity amidst favorable market conditions as well as higher new issuance volumes to fund municipal infrastructure investment needs. Additionally, the growth in the U.S. reflects higher infrastructure finance revenue. Outside the U.S., PPIF revenue was $136.0 million and increased $4.3 million compared to 2015 reflecting benefits from changes in the mix of fee type, new fee initiatives and pricing increases as well as higher infrastructure finance revenue in the Americas region. These increases were partially offset by lower project finance revenue across all non-U.S. regions. Transaction revenue was 63% of total PPIF revenue in 2016 compared to 60% in the prior year.\nGlobal MIS Other revenue of $30.6 million in 2016 was flat compared to 2015.\nOperating and SG&A expenses in 2016 decreased $5.1 million compared to 2015 primarily reflecting lower non-compensation costs of approximately $25.0 million reflecting overall cost control initiatives. This decrease was partially offset by higher compensation expenses of approximately $20 million compared to the prior year reflecting annual salary increases coupled with higher incentive compensation costs resulting from higher achievement against full-year targeted results compared to the prior year.\nThe increase in D&A compared to the prior year reflects capital expenditures related to investments in the Company's IT and operational infrastructure.\nThe restructuring charge in 2016 relates to cost management initiatives in the MIS segment as well as in certain corporate overhead functions.\nThe Settlement Charge is pursuant to an agreement with the DOJ and the attorneys general of 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.\nAdjusted Operating Income was $1,355.4 million and increased $48.0 million compared to the prior year. Operating income in 2016, which includes the aforementioned $863.8 million Settlement Charge, was $407.6 million and decreased $833.8 million compared to the prior year. Adjusted Operating Margin was 54.9% or 100 BPS higher than the prior year. Operating margin was 16.5% in 2016 compared to 51.1% in the prior year, with the decline primarily due to the aforementioned Settlement Charge. Adjusted Operating Income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

compared to 2015 and reflected growth in RD&A as well as ERS, which included revenue from the acquisition of GGY. Additionally, the growth over the prior year reflects benefits from pricing increases within MA's recurring revenue base. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX rates, MA revenue grew 10% compared to the prior year. Recurring revenue comprised 75% and 74% of total MA revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIn the U.S., revenue of $603.6 million in 2016 increased $68.9 million, and reflected growth in RD&A and ERS. The growth in RD&A reflected strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data as well as higher revenue within SAV and ECCA. The increase in ERS revenue reflected growth across all product verticals and included revenue from the acquisition of GGY in March 2016.\nNon-U.S. revenue of $629.8 million in 2016 was $14.2 million higher than in 2015 reflecting growth in RD&A and ERS partially offset by unfavorable changes in FX rates. The growth in RD&A primarily reflects strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data in the Asia-Pacific region. The increase in ERS was primarily due to higher revenue from the Assets Liability & Capital and Credit Assessment & Origination product verticals in the EMEA region coupled with revenue from the acquisition of GGY. These increases were partially offset by declines in the Credit Assessment & Origination product vertical in the Americas region.\nGlobal RD&A revenue of $667.6 million, which comprised 54% of total external MA revenue in both 2016 and 2015, increased $41.2 million, or 7%, over the prior year period. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX rates, RD&A revenue increased 9% over the prior year. The growth reflected strength in credit research subscriptions and licensing of ratings data as well as higher revenue within SAV and ECCA. The growth compared to 2015 also reflects the benefits of pricing increases. In the U.S., revenue of $389.3 million increased $37.4 million compared to 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $278.3 million increased $3.8 million compared to the prior year.\nGlobal ERS revenue of $418.8 million in 2016 increased $44.8 million, or 12%, over 2015. Excluding unfavorable changes in FX rates, ERS revenue grew 15% reflecting increases across most product offerings and included revenue from the acquisition of GGY in March of 2016. Additionally, the revenue growth reflects benefits from pricing increases within ERS's recurring revenue base. Revenue in ERS is subject to quarterly volatility resulting from the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of software implementation and license revenue in a relatively small number of engagements. In the U.S., revenue of $162.9 million increased $31.7 million compared to the prior year. Non-U.S. revenue of $255.9 million increased $13.1 million compared to the prior year.\nGlobal PS revenue of $147.0 million in 2016 decreased $2.9 million, or 2%, from 2015. Excluding the unfavorable impact from changes in FX translation rates, PS revenue was flat compared to the prior year. In the U.S. and internationally revenue was $51.4 million and $95.6 million, respectively, or flat and down 3%, respectively.\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in D&A compared to the prior year reflects capital expenditures related to investments in the Company's IT and operational infrastructure as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nOperating and SG&A expenses in 2016 increased $70.5 million compared to 2015. The expense growth primarily reflects an approximate $68 million increase in compensation costs primarily due to higher headcount to support business growth as well as headcount from the acquisition of GGY coupled with annual merit increases.\nAdjusted Operating Income was $285.8 million in 2016 and increased $6.3 million compared to the same period in 2015. Operating income of $231.1 million in 2016 decreased $0.9 million compared to the same period in 2015. Adjusted Operating Margin in 2016 was 22.9%, down 110bps from 2015. Operating margin was 18.5% in 2016, down 140bps from the prior year. Operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin in 2016 were suppressed due to a larger proportion of overhead costs allocated to MA under the Company's revenue-split methodology. Adjusted operating income and operating income both include intersegment revenue and expense.\nMARKET RISK\nForeign exchange risk:\nMoody's maintains a presence in 40 countries outside the U.S. In 2017, approximately 40% and 39% of both the Company's revenue and expenses, respectively were denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 81% of Moody's assets were located outside the U.S. making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. The effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with non-U.S. functional currencies to the U.S. dollar are charged or credited to OCI.\nThe effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency are charged to other non-operating income (expense), net in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency. The following table shows the impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign Currency Forwards *\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Impact on fair value of contract if\nforeign currency strengthened by 10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sell\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Buy </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>British pound </td> <td> </td> <td>$47 million unfavorable impact </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>Canadian dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>$6 million unfavorable impact </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>Euro </td> <td> </td> <td>$47 million unfavorable impact </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>Japanese yen </td> <td> </td> <td>$3 million unfavorable impact </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>Singapore dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>$4 million unfavorable impact </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>* </td> <td>Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further detail on the forward contracts. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by FX revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency.\nAlso, the Company has designated \u0080500 million of the 2015 Senior Notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate FX exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries. If the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $56 million unfavorable adjustment to OCI related to this net investment hedge. This adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the Company's euro net investment in subsidiaries.\nMoody's aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short- term investments of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 included $1 billion located outside the U.S. Approximately 62% of the Company's aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at December 31, 2017 were held in currencies other than USD. As such, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro and GBP, could reduce the reported amount of USD cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nCredit and Interest rate risk:\nThe Company's interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. Moody's uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives.\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate of interest on certain of its borrowings to a floating rate based on the 3-month LIBOR. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>MOODY'S 2017 10-K </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nbased on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. A hypothetical change of 100bps in the LIBOR-based swap rate would result in an approximate $26 million change to the fair value of these interest rate swaps.\nAdditional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nMoody's cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the U.S. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit and issuers of high-grade commercial paper and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flow\nThe Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases from operating and financing cash flows.\nThe following is a summary of the changes in the Company's cash flows followed by a brief discussion of these changes:\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change\nFavorable\n(unfavorable) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change\nFavorable\n(unfavorable) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>747.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,259.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(511.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,259.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,198.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,420.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,522.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(92.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,607.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,042.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,650.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,042.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(505.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(537.4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Free Cash Flow * </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>656.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,144.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(487.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,144.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,109.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>* </td> <td>Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital expenditures.

The Company manages both its U.S. and international cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs.\nOther Material Future Cash Requirements\nThe Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow in 2018. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company's profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources.\nThe Company remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by investing in growing areas of the business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiatives, making selective acquisitions, repurchasing stock and paying a dividend, all in a manner consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity after giving effect to any additional indebtedness that may be incurred.\nIn January 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share of Moody's common stock, payable March 12, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2018.

In December 2015, the Board authorized $1.0 billion of share repurchase authority, which had a remaining repurchase authority of approximately $0.5 million at December 31, 2017. Full-year 2018 total share repurchases are expected to be approximately $200 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.\nThe Company has future cash requirements, including operating leases and debt service and principal payments, as noted in the tables that follow as well as future payments related to the transition tax under the Tax Act:\nIndebtedness\nAt December 31, 2017, Moody's had $5.5 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $0.9 billion of additional capacity available under the Company's CP program which is backstopped by the 2015 Facility as more fully discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. All of the Company's long-term debt agreements contain cross default provisions which state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2017, there were no such cross defaults.\nThe repayment schedule for the Company's borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2017, Moody's did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moody's is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose

These non-GAAP measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company. Below are descriptions of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure:\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin:\nThe Company presents Adjusted Operating Income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of Moody's. Adjusted Operating Income excludes depreciation and amortization, Acquisition-Related Expenses, restructuring and the Settlement Charge. Depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Acquisition-Related Expenses consist of expenses incurred to complete and integrate the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk and are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multi-year integration effort. Acquisition related expenses from previous acquisitions were not material. Restructuring charges are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies. The Settlement Charge is a material non-recurring event that is not expected to recur in the future at this magnitude. Management believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, Acquisition-Related Expenses, restructuring and the Settlement Charge, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the Company's operating results from period to period and across companies. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenue.\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,809.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>638.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,473.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition-Related Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Settlement Charge\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>863.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted Operating Income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,989.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,641.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,586.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted Operating Margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS attributable to Moody's common shareholders:\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2017, the Company modified this adjusted measure to exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different ages and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. Also, management believes that excluding acquisition-related amortization expense provides additional perspective when comparing operating results from period to period, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. Furthermore, U.S. tax reform as well as changes in statutory tax rates in Belgium were both enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in significant adjustments to the tax provision. The Company modified the adjusted measures to exclude these adjustments to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted EPS from period to period and across companies. In addition to excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the effects of U.S. tax reform as well as the statutory tax rate change in Belgium, current and prior-year adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the CCXI Gain, the Purchase Price Hedge Gain, Acquisition-Related Expenses, restructuring charges and the Settlement Charge. The Company excludes these items to provide additional perspective on the Company's operating results from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods. Additionally, the Acquisition-Related Expenses are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multi-year integration effort relating to Bureau van Dijk. Acquisition-Related Expenses from previous acquisitions were not material.\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td>

Management believes that Free Cash Flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company's cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company's product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody's operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of Moody's cash flow.

Other factors, risks and uncertainties relating to our acquisition of Bureau van Dijk could cause our actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, including risks relating to the integration of Bureau van Dijk's operations, products and employees into Moody's and the possibility that anticipated synergies and other benefits of the acquisition will not be realized in the amounts anticipated or will not be realized within the expected timeframe; risks that the acquisition could have an adverse effect on the business of Bureau van Dijk or its prospects, including, without limitation, on relationships with vendors, suppliers or customers; claims made, from time to time, by vendors, suppliers or customers; changes in the European or global marketplaces that have an adverse effect on the business of Bureau van Dijk.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nThis discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody's Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis MD&A contains Forward-Looking Statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d commencing on page 58 and Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d commencing on page 18 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.\nTHE COMPANY\nMoody's is a provider of (i) credit ratings; (ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools; (iii) software solutions that support financial risk management activities; (iv) quantitatively derived credit scores; (v) financial services training and certification services; (vi) offshore financial research and analytical services; and (vii) company information and business intelligence products. Moody's reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA.\nMIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations which consist primarily of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA's non-ratings operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.\nThe MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit-related events. The RD&A business also produces economic research and data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores as well as business intelligence and company information products. Within its ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The PS business provides offshore research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nMoody's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody's to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody's evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets (including the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets), pension and other retirement benefits and UTBs. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management's judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.\nPursuant to ASC Topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nThe Company's products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company's control. In instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.\n MOODY'S 2017 10-K 31 \nThe Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or, if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price. In instances where the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history, the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASC Topic 605, when the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.\nIn the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, structured credit, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which was approximately 24 years on a weighted average basis at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $140.1 million, $133.0 million, and $121.0 million.\nMultiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. In instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company generally uses ESP in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely provides initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings.\nMIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers' most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, accounts receivable included approximately $27.0 million, $25.0 million, and $24.0 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, accounts receivable included approximately $185.0 million, $159.1 million, and $146.4 million, respectively, relating to accrued annual monitoring service revenue.\nIn the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.\nProducts and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.\nIf the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the\n 32 MOODY'S 2017 10-K \nresidual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation services are considered essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d), once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized over the coverage period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period. If VSOE does not exist for PCS at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation, revenue not recognized due to the absence of VSOE will be recognized on a cumulative basis.\nAccounts Receivable Allowance\nMoody's records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are charged against the allowance. Moody's evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and invoice adjustment experience as well as the current aging status of customer accounts. Moody's also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody's adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody's results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the Company's consolidated results of operations.\nContingencies\nAccounting for contingencies, including those matters described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management's best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.\nFor claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, but discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.\nThe Company's wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker's compensation, employment practices litigation, employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs\n MOODY'S 2017 10-K 33 \nrelated to professional liability claims.

million, net of tax, or $3.59 per diluted share) in 2016. \n (2) The decline in operating cash flow in 2017 is primarily due to payments made relating to the Settlement Charge. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09 \u201cImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d. As required by ASU 2016-09, Excess Tax Benefits or shortfalls relating to employee stock-based compensation are reflected in operating cash flow and the Company has applied this provision on a retrospective basis. Under previous accounting guidance, Excess Tax Benefits or shortfalls were shown as a reduction to operating cash flow and an increase to financing cash flow. \n (3) Provision for income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a net charge of $245.6 million related to the impact of U.S. tax reform and a statutory tax rate reduction in Belgium as more fully discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n (4) The 2017 amount includes a $111.1 million Purchase Price Hedge Gain as well as the $59.7 million CCXI Gain. The 2016 amount includes an approximate $35 million FX gain relating to the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary. The 2015, 2014 and 2013 amounts include benefits of $7.1 million, $7.1 million and $22.8 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain Legacy Tax Matters. The 2014 amount also includes the ICRA Gain of $102.8 million. \n MOODY'S 2017 10-K 29 \n (5) The 2017 amount includes: i) a $245.6 million ($1.27 per share) net charge related to the impact of U.S. tax reform and a statutory tax rate reduction in Belgium; ii) a $72.3 million ($0.37 per share) Purchase Price Hedge Gain; and iii) the $59.7 million ($0.31 per share) CCXI Gain. The 2016 amount includes: i) a $700.7 million ($3.59 per share) Settlement Charge; ii) $8.1 million ($0.04 per share) restructuring charge; and iii) a $34.8 million ($0.18 per share) FX gain relating to the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary. The 2015, 2014 and 2013 amounts include benefits of $6.4 million ($0.03 per share), $6.4 million ($0.03 per share) and $21.3 million ($0.09 per share), respectively, related to the resolution of certain Legacy Tax Matters. Also, the 2014 amount includes the ICRA Gain of $78.5 million ($0.37 per share) and the 2013 amount includes a litigation settlement charge of $0.14 per share. \n (6) The 2017 amount excludes $429.4 million relating to the current portion of long-term debt and commercial paper. The 2016 amount excludes $300.0 million of the Series 2007-1 Notes which were due in 2017. \n 30 MOODY'S 2017 10-K \n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nThis discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody's Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis MD&A contains Forward-Looking Statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d commencing on page 58 and Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d commencing on page 18 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.\nTHE COMPANY\nMoody's is a provider of (i) credit ratings; (ii) credit, capital markets and economic research, data and analytical tools; (iii) software solutions that support financial risk management activities; (iv) quantitatively derived credit scores; (v) financial services training and certification services; (vi) offshore financial research and analytical services; and (vii) company information and business intelligence products. Moody's reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA.\nMIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations which consist primarily of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA's non-ratings operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.\nThe MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit-related events. The RD&A business also produces economic research and data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores as well as business intelligence and company information products. Within its ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The PS business provides offshore research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nMoody's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody's to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody's evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets (including the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets), pension and other retirement benefits and UTBs. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management's judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.\nPursuant to ASC Topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nThe Company's products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company's control. In instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.\n MOODY'S 2017 10-K 31 \nThe Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or, if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price. In instances where the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history, the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASC Topic 605, when the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.\nIn the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, structured credit, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which was approximately 24 years on a weighted average basis at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $140.1 million, $133.0 million, and $121.0 million.\nMultiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. In instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company generally uses ESP in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely provides initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings.\nMIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers' most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, accounts receivable included approximately $27.0 million, $25.0 million, and $24.0 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, accounts receivable included approximately $185.0 million, $159.1 million, and $146.4 million, respectively, relating to accrued annual monitoring service revenue.\nIn the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.\nProducts and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.\nIf the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the\n 32 MOODY'S 2017 10-K \nresidual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation services are considered essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d), once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized over the coverage period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period. If VSOE does not exist for PCS at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation, revenue not recognized due to the absence of VSOE will be recognized on a cumulative basis.\nAccounts Receivable Allowance\nMoody's records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are charged against the allowance. Moody's evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and invoice adjustment experience as well as the current aging status of customer accounts. Moody's also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody's adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody's results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the Company's consolidated results of operations.\nContingencies\nAccounting for contingencies, including those matters described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management's best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.\nFor claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, but discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.\nThe Company's wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker's compensation, employment practices litigation, employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs\n MOODY'S 2017 10-K 33 \nrelated to professional liability claims. For matters insured by the Company's insurance subsidiary, Moody's records liabilities based on the"}
