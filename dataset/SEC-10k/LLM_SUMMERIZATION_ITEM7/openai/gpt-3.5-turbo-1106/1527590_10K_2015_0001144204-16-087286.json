Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company invests in residential mortgage loans. GMFS, a mortgage banking platform the Company acquired in October 2014, originates, sells and services mortgage loans and the Company acquires performing, re-performing and newly originated loans through other channels. The Company also invests in, finances and manages non-Agency RMBS with an emphasis on securities that, when originally issued, were rated in the highest rating category by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and MSRs. The Company also has the discretion to invest in Agency RMBS, including through TBA contracts, and in other real estate-related and financial assets, such as IOs. The Company refers collectively to its assets as its 'target assets'.\nAs announced on November 4, 2015, the Company has engaged a financial advisor to assist in evaluating potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. The continuing strategic review includes the exploration of merger or sale transactions involving the Company or a liquidation of the Company's assets. The Company and its financial advisor have engaged in preliminary discussions with several potential counterparties. While the Company is currently engaged in discussions with a potential counterparty about a potential merger or sale transaction, there is no assurance that the discussions will lead to a definitive merger or sale transaction, which would be subject to approval by the Company's board of directors and its stockholders. In the event that the Company does not reach a definitive agreement with respect to a merger or sale transaction, management of the Company intends to present to the Company's board of directors for its consideration a plan of liquidation. There is no assurance that the Company's board of directors will approve any plan of liquidation and recommend its acceptance by the Company's stockholders. In light of the strategic review and in order to reduce current market risk in its investment portfolio, the Company has recently begun the process of selling its seasoned, re-performing mortgage loans from its residential mortgage investments segment. A sale of these assets is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2016. If completed, these mortgage loan sales are likely to result in a reduction of the Company's investment income and may therefore result in a decision to curtail dividends in the future. Additionally, as part of the strategic review, the Company has made the decision to cease the purchase of newly originated residential mortgage loans as part of its mortgage conduit purchase program and will begin the unwinding of the Company's mortgage conduit business. Consistent with these changes to the Company's strategy, on March 9, 2016, Brian Hargrave resigned as the Company's Chief Investment Officer and will be succeeded by Christian Zugel, the current Chairman of the Company's board of directors. The Company does not intend to disclose further developments until the review is complete and the Company's board of directors has taken action with respect to the strategic review.\nThe Company's income is generated primarily by the net spread between the income it earns on its assets and the cost of its financing and hedging activities in its residential mortgage investments segment, and the origination, sale and servicing of residential mortgage loans in its residential mortgage banking segment. The Company's objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders, primarily through quarterly distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company was incorporated in Maryland on May 24, 2011 and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2011. The Company is organized in a format pursuant to which it serves as the general partner of, and conducts substantially all of its business through, its Operating Partnership subsidiary, ZAIS Financial Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. The Company is externally managed by the Advisor, a subsidiary of ZAIS, and has no employees except for those employed by GMFS, its wholly-owned subsidiary. GMFS had 246 employees at December 31, 2015. The Company also expects to operate its business so that it is not required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act.\nPursuant to the terms of the GMFS Merger Agreement among Honeybee TRS, Honeybee Acquisitions, GMFS, and Honeyrep, LLC, solely in its capacity as the security holder representative, Honeybee Acquisitions merged with and into GMFS on October 31, 2014, with GMFS continuing as the surviving entity and an indirect subsidiary of the Company. GMFS is an approved Fannie Mae Seller-Servicer, Freddie Mac Seller-Servicer, Ginnie Mae issuer, HUD/FHA Mortgagee, USDA approved originator and VA Lender. GMFS currently originates loans that are eligible to be purchased, guaranteed or insured by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA and USDA through retail, correspondent and broker channels. GMFS also originates and sells reverse mortgage loans as part of its existing operations.\nThe final purchase price was approximately $61.2 million, net of approximately $1.7 million received from an escrow account pursuant to the GMFS Merger Agreement, based on the final reconciliation of GMFS's net tangible assets. The net tangible assets at closing were comprised of the estimated fair value of GMFS's MSR portfolio, the estimated value of GMFS's net tangible assets and a purchase price premium. In addition to cash paid at closing, two contingent $1 million deferred premium payments payable in cash over two years, plus the Production and Profitability Earn-Out. The $2 million of deferred premium payments is contingent on GMFS remaining profitable and retaining certain key employees. The Production and Profitability Earn-Out is dependent on GMFS achieving certain profitability and loan production goals and is capped at $20 million. Up to 50% of the Production and Profitability Earn-Out may be paid in common stock of the Company, at the Company's option. The estimated present value of the total contingent consideration at October 31, 2014 was $11.4 million based on the future production and earnings projections of GMFS over the four-year earn-out period (at December 31, 2015 the contingent consideration liability was $11.3 million). The Company funded the closing cash payment through a combination of available cash and the sale of a portion of its non-Agency RMBS portfolio. As discussed above, pursuant to the GMFS Merger Agreement, based on the final reconciliation of the October 31, 2014 values, the Company received $1,684,263 in June 2015 from an escrow account established at the time of the closing. The Company recorded a reduction to goodwill in the consolidated balance sheets that included this amount, along with other final closing adjustments. Additionally, in 2015 the goodwill and other intangible assets were measured for impairment. The Company determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of these assets are recoverable and therefore, the Company did not recognize any impairment of these assets under U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company is externally managed by the Advisor, a subsidiary of ZAIS. On March 17, 2015, a business combination was completed between HF2 Financial, a special purpose acquisition company, and ZGP, which wholly owns ZAIS, pursuant to a definitive agreement dated September 16, 2014. The current owners of ZGP did not receive any proceeds at the closing of the transaction and retained a significant equity stake in ZGP. Following the close of the transaction, ZAIS's management team has remained in place to continue to lead the combined organization.\nThe Company operated as one operating segment prior to the acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014. Subsequent to the acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014, the Company operates in two operating segments: residential mortgage investments and residential mortgage banking. These operating segments have been identified based on the Company's organizational and management structure. These segments are based on an internally-aligned segment structure, which is how the Company's results are monitored and performance is assessed.\nThe residential mortgage investments segment includes a portfolio of mortgage loans which were either distressed, re-performing or newly originated at the time of purchase. The residential mortgage banking segment includes the operations of GMFS, which originates mortgage loans for subsequent sale as either servicing retained or released, and expenses incurred by ZFC Honeybee TRS, LLC.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company held a diversified portfolio of mortgage loans, RMBS and MSRs with an aggregate fair value of $671.2 million, comprised of the following:\nResidential Mortgage Investments\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Performing, re-performing and newly originated loans with a fair value of $397.7 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>RMBS assets with a fair value of $109.3 million, consisting primarily of senior tranches of non-Agency RMBS that were originally highly rated but subsequently downgraded and, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResidential Mortgage Banking\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Mortgage loans originated by the GMFS mortgage banking platform and held for sale with a fair value of $116.0 million; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>MSRs with a fair value of $48.2 million. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFactors Impacting Operating Results\nThe Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were impacted by a number of factors. Home prices, which are a significant correlating factor to the Company's performance, rose 5.25% for the 12 months ended November 2015 according to Case Shiller (20 City Index, seasonally adjusted). In addition, as the housing markets continue to recover from the credit crisis, most housing metrics continue to improve including: the level of distressed homes for sale, delinquencies and foreclosures. Interest rates moved modestly higher during the year, and in December the Federal Reserve initiated its first increase in the federal funds target rate since the financial crisis. This served to raise short-term borrowing costs and was largely in line with market expectations. Fixed income market volatility increased during the second half of the year, in particular in the high yield corporate debt markets. This caused some spread widening in most fixed income credit sectors, including non-Agency RMBS. The market for residential mortgage loans was also somewhat negatively impacted by these market dynamics. Labor market conditions showed improvement and a benign inflation environment continued, all of which are supportive of mortgage credit performance. The RMBS and whole loan portfolios saw a decline in market value during the year.\nThe Company expects that the results of its operations will also be affected by a number of other factors, including the level of its net interest income, the fair value of its assets and the supply of, and demand for, the target assets in which it may invest. The Company's net interest income, which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, varies, primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds, as measured by Constant Prepayment Rates ( CPR\u201d) on the Company's target assets. Interest rates and prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. The Company's operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are held directly by the Company or included in its non-Agency RMBS or Other Investment Securities or in other assets it may originate or acquire.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company held a diversified portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment with a fair value of $397.7 million, mortgage loans held for sale with a fair value of $116.0 million, RMBS assets with a fair value of $109.3 million and MSRs with a fair value of $48.2 million.\nChanges in Fair Value of the Company's Assets\nThe Company's mortgage loans held for investment, mortgage loans held for sale, RMBS and Other Investment Securities are carried at fair value and future mortgage-related assets may also be carried at fair value. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the Company's assets may impact the results of its operations for the period in which such change in value occurs. The expectation of changes in real estate prices is a major determinant of the value of mortgage loans and, therefore, of RMBS and Other Investment Securities. This factor is beyond the Company's control.\nChanges in Market Interest Rates\nWith respect to the Company's business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may, over time, cause: (i) the interest expense associated with the Company's borrowings to increase; (ii) the value of its fixed-rate portfolio to decline; (iii) coupons on its ARMs and hybrid ARMs (including RMBS secured by such collateral) and on its residential mortgage loans and other floating rate securities to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (iv) prepayments on its residential mortgage investments and RMBS to slow, thereby slowing the amortization of the Company's purchase premiums and the accretion of its purchase discounts; (v) a decrease in the Company's mortgage banking origination volume and operating activities; (vi) the value of its interest rate swap agreements to increase; and (vii) the value of its MSRs to increase.\nConversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may, over time, cause: (i) prepayments on the Company's residential mortgage investments and RMBS to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of its purchase premiums and the accretion of its purchase discounts; (ii) the interest expense associated with its borrowings to decrease; (iii) the value of its fixed-rate portfolio to increase; (iv) the value of its interest rate swap agreements to decrease; (v) coupons on its ARMs and hybrid ARMs held for investment (including RMBS secured by such collateral) and other floating rate securities to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; (vi) an increase in the Company's mortgage banking origination volume and operating activities; and (vii) the value of its MSRs to decrease. At December 31, 2015, 36.4% of the Company's performing mortgage loans held for investment, as measured by fair value consisted of mortgage loans with a variable interest rate component, including ARMs and hybrid ARMs. At December 31, 2015, 36.7% of the Company's RMBS assets, as measured by fair value, consisted of RMBS assets with a variable interest rate component, including ARMs and hybrid ARMs. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, 100.0 % of the Company's Other Investment Securities, as measured by fair value, consisted of the Fannie Mae Risk Transfer Notes ( FMSA Notes\u201d) and the Freddie Mac Structured Agency Credit Risk Notes ( FMRT Notes\u201d) with a variable interest rate component.\nPrepayment Speeds\nPrepayment speeds on residential mortgage loans, and therefore, RMBS and MSRs vary according to interest rates, the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition, defaults, foreclosures and other factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty. In general, when interest rates rise, it is relatively less attractive for borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans and, as a result, prepayment speeds tend to decrease. This can extend the period over which the Company earns interest income. When interest rates fall, prepayment speeds on residential mortgage loans, and therefore, RMBS and MSRs tend to increase, thereby decreasing the period over which the Company earns interest income. Additionally, other factors such as the credit rating of the borrower, the rate of home price appreciation or depreciation, financial market conditions, foreclosures and lender competition, none of which can be predicted with any certainty, may affect prepayment speeds on residential mortgage loans, RMBS and MSRs.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSpreads on Non-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans Held for Investment and Securities\nSince the financial crisis that began in 2007, the spreads between swap rates and residential mortgage loans and non-Agency RMBS have been volatile. Spreads on these assets initially moved wider due to the difficult credit conditions and have only recovered a portion of that widening. As the prices of securitized assets declined, a number of investors and a number of structured investment vehicles faced margin calls from dealers and were forced to sell assets in order to reduce leverage. The price volatility of these assets also impacted lending terms in the repurchase market, as counterparties raised margin requirements to reflect the more difficult environment. The spread between the yield on the Company's assets and its funding costs is an important factor in the performance of this aspect of the Company's business. Wider spreads imply greater income on new asset purchases but may have a negative impact on the Company's stated book value. Wider spreads generally negatively impact asset prices. In an environment where spreads are widening, counterparties may require additional collateral to secure borrowings, which may require the Company to reduce leverage by selling assets. Conversely, tighter spreads imply lower income on new asset purchases, but may have a positive impact on the Company's stated book value. Tighter spreads generally have a positive impact on asset prices. In this case, the Company may be able to reduce the amount of collateral required to secure borrowings.\nMortgage Extension Risk\nThe Advisor computes the projected weighted-average life of the Company's investments based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages and the rate at which defaults, foreclosures and recoveries will occur. In general, when the Company originates or acquires a fixed-rate mortgage or hybrid ARM asset, the Company may, but is not required to, enter into an interest rate swap agreement, MBS forward sales contract or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes the Company's borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed-rate portion of the related assets. This strategy is designed to protect the Company from rising interest rates, because the borrowing costs are effectively fixed for the duration of the fixed-rate portion of the related RMBS.\nHowever, if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment, the life of the fixed-rate portion of the related assets could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument. This could have a negative impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the maturity or termination of hedging instruments while the income earned on the assets would remain fixed. This situation may also cause the fair value of the Company's assets to decline, with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions. In extreme situations, the Company may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause the Company to incur losses.\nIn addition, the use of this swap hedging strategy effectively limits increases in the Company's book value in a declining rate environment, due to the effectively fixed nature of the Company's hedged borrowing costs. In an extreme rate decline, prepayment rates on the Company's assets might actually result in certain of its assets being fully paid off while the corresponding swap or other hedge instrument remains outstanding. In such a situation, the Company may be forced to liquidate the swap or other hedge instrument at a level that causes it to incur a loss.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company is subject to credit risk in connection with its investments. Although the Company does not expect to encounter credit risk in its Agency RMBS, if any, it does expect to encounter credit risk related to its non-Agency RMBS, mortgage loans and other target assets, including assets it may originate or acquire. Increases in defaults and delinquencies will adversely impact the Company's operating results, while declines in rates of default and delinquencies may improve the Company's operating results from this aspect of its business. The Company is subject to counterparty risk under the FMSA Notes and FMRT Notes if Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, respectively, is unable to perform its obligations under the respective notes.\nA large portion of the mortgage loans held for investment that the Company acquired was current in their payment status at the time of acquisition. The Company calculates delinquency roll rates for its mortgage loan portfolio which represent the percentage of loans, as measured by unpaid principal balance that were in current payment status in the prior month but became delinquent in the measured month. The Company's delinquency roll rates have generally outperformed its model projections from late 2013 when the whole loan portfolio achieved scale through December 31, 2015.\nSize of Investment Portfolio\nThe size of the Company's investment portfolio, as measured by the aggregate principal balance of its mortgage-related securities and the other assets the Company owns, is a key driver of revenues and expenses. The amount of interest income the Company receives and the amount of interest expense to finance these assets is generally dependent on the size of the investment portfolio.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegulatory Update\nThe Dodd-Frank Act directed the CFPB to integrate certain mortgage loan disclosures under the TILA and the RESPA, and effective October 3, 2015, new disclosure rules went into effect for newly originated residential mortgage loans. These rules include RESPA new consumer disclosure forms, new processes for determining when disclosures must be updated and new timelines for providing disclosure documents to borrowers. The new rules have created the need for substantial system and process changes and new training within the mortgage loan origination industry.\nUnder the direction and guidance of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (\"GSEs\" or \"Agencies\") are developing a common securitization platform (\"CSP\") for their single-family mortgage securitization activities, including the issuance by both GSEs of a single MBS. The CSP is expected to be a common information technology platform that will use industry-standard software, systems and data requirements and will be adaptable for use by other market participants in the future. The CSP is being developed by a joint venture owned by the GSEs and will leverage the GSEs' existing security structures and would encompass many of the pooling features of the current Fannie Mae MBS and more of the disclosure framework of the current Freddie Mac participation certificate. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is expected to make an announcement in 2016 as to the date that Freddie Mac is expected to begin using the CSP as part of its first phase, with Fannie Mae to begin using the CSP at a later time.\nIn October 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced a plan that could ease credit, enabling more people to qualify for mortgages by further relaxing agreements that determine when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can require lenders to buy back bad loans and permitting borrowers to qualify for certain mortgage loans with smaller down payments than are now required. In October 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac further modified their buy back policies (which took effect on January 1, 2016) to provide potential alternatives to repurchase in respect of certain categories of loan defects. These plans and policy changes are designed to provide lenders with more clarity and transparency and to offer reassurances to lenders that fear they could suffer unpredictable losses on the loans that they securitize through the GSEs. It remains unclear which, if any, of the currently proposed legislation or initiatives will be enacted, and, if any legislation or initiatives are enacted, what the impact of such legislation or initiatives will be. For a discussion of additional risks relating to the Company's business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRecent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation\nOn December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act\u201d). The PATH Act changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT shareholders, which are briefly summarized below.\nTable 148: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT's total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more Taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d) is reduced from 25% to 20%. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td> Publicly offered REITs\u201d (which generally include any REIT required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC, including the Company) are no longer subject to the preferential dividend rules for taxable years beginning after 2014. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test.

Similarly, debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax is reduced from ten years to five years. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to redetermined services income, \u201d i.e., non-arm's-length income of a REIT's TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The rate of withholding tax applicable under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ( FIRPTA\u201d) to certain sales and other dispositions of U.S. real property interests ( USRPIs\u201d) by non-U.S. persons, and certain distributions from corporations whose stock may constitute a USRPI, is increased from 10% to 15% for dispositions and distributions occurring after February 16, 2016. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends received from a publicly traded REIT as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Effective December 18, 2015, certain look-through presumption, and other rules will apply for purposes of determining if the Company qualifies as domestically controlled. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, certain qualified foreign pension funds\u201d satisfying certain requirements, as well as entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund, are exempt from income and withholding taxes applicable under FIRPTA.

The Company defines Core Earnings as net interest income, plus non-interest income from its mortgage banking platform (excluding the after tax change in fair value of MSRs resulting from changes in values of market related inputs or assumptions used in a valuation model) less total operating expenses (excluding the after tax effect of depreciation and amortization, changes in contingent consideration, amortization of deferred premiums, production and profitability earn-outs and certain non-recurring adjustments) plus/(less) the income tax benefit/(expense) related to the Company's TRSs using the applicable effective tax rate for the period. The Company's mortgage banking platform is primarily comprised of income related to originating, selling, and servicing mortgage loans.\nCore Earnings is an incomplete measure of the Company's financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, the Company's net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Core Earnings may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net (loss)/income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Core Earnings:\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands, except per share data) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (loss)/income after income taxes- U.S. GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,419 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,553 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Recurring adjustments for non-core earnings: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in unrealized gain or loss on mortgage loans held for investment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,814 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,136 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in unrealized gain or loss on real estate securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,171 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in unrealized gain or loss on Other Investment Securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in unrealized gain or loss on real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized gain on mortgage loans held for investment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,479 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,839 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,299 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized (gain)/loss on real estate securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,694 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,046 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized loss/(gain) on other investment securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(227 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized loss/(gain) on real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss/(gain) on derivative instruments related to investment portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,615 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of MSRs resulting from changes in values of market related inputs or assumptions used in a valuation model, net of tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in contingent consideration, net of tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of deferred premiums, production and profitability earn-outs, net of tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization, net of tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-controlling interests </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Core Earnings - non-U.S. GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Core Earnings - per diluted weighted average share outstanding - non-U.S. GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td>(1) </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Calculation has been revised to conform with current period's methodology.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCore Earnings was $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in Core Earnings was primarily due to an increase of $6.3 million (net of income taxes) due to the acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014, offset by a decrease of $4.7 million related to the Company's residential mortgage investment portfolio due to the sale of RMBS to fund the acquisition of GMFS.\nCore Earnings was $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in Core Earnings was primarily due to an increase of $2.2 million (net of income taxes) due to the acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014.\nFinancial Overview\nThe Company reported GAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.4 million or $0.16 per diluted weighted average share outstanding, compared with net income of $29.9 million or $3.08 per diluted weighted average share outstanding for the same period in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized unrealized and realized losses of $14.0 million related to its investment portfolio compared to unrealized and realized gains of $18.9 million for the same period in 2014. The unrealized losses in 2015 were primarily attributable to the market dynamics discussed in Item 1, Business\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K as well as principal amortization from scheduled paydowns. These results include GMFS operations, which contributed $13.5 million of net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $583,000 of net income for the same period in 2014. The 2014 results include GMFS for the period from October 31, 2014 (the date of acquisition) to December 31, 2014.\nGMFS\nHighlights of the GMFS operating activity (which is included in the Company's

The Company's interest expense is related to the Company's warehouse lines of credit, the Loan Repurchase Facilities, securities repurchase agreements and the Exchangeable Senior Notes.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was as follows:\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,593 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,333 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in interest income was due to (i) a decrease in interest income of $0.2 million related to mortgage loans held for investment due to scheduled pay downs and payoffs and (ii) a decrease in interest income of $6.1 million related to RMBS; offset by an increase in interest income on mortgage loans held for sale of $2.6 million due to the acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014. The reduction in interest income from the RMBS portfolio is primarily due to the reallocation of capital to whole loans in 2014 consistent with the Company's investment strategy and the sales of RMBS during the three months ended December 31, 2014 to fund the acquisition of GMFS.\nThe increase in interest expense was due to (i) an increase in interest expense of $2.0 million related to an increase in borrowings on the warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements used to finance the Company's mortgage loans held for sale; (ii) an increase in interest expense of $0.5 million related to an increase in borrowings on the Company's Loan Repurchase Facilities used to finance the Company's residential mortgage loans held for investment; and (iii) an increase in interest expense of $0.1 million related to the issuance of the Exchangeable Senior Notes, offset by a decrease in interest expense of $1.1 million related to a decrease in borrowings on the securities repurchase agreements.\nNet interest income is subject to interest rate risk.

Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company incurred advisory fee expense and loan sourcing fees of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $0.1 million is due to an increase in loan sourcing fees due to the increased activity during 2015.\nSalaries, commissions and benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred salaries, commissions and benefits of $30.9, as compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These expenses are directly attributable to the mortgage banking operations of GMFS. The amount for 2014 reflects the expenses recognized from October 31, 2014 (the date the Company acquired GMFS) to December 31, 2014.\nOperating Expenses\nProfessional Fees. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred professional fees (primarily related to legal fees, audit fees and consulting fees) of $4.1 million as compared to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in professional fees was primarily due to legal and audit fees incurred for the GMFS transaction and legal fees incurred in conjunction with the launch of the loan conduit program in 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses were $8.2 million as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $4.0 million of GMFS expenses, an increase in research fees of $0.5 million; offset by a decrease in the contingent consideration liability of $0.1 million. The amounts relating to GMFS primarily relate to (i) rent and related occupancy expenses, (ii) marketing and advertising costs and (iii) other miscellaneous expenses. The expenses related to GMFS in 2014 reflect the expenses recognized from October 31, 2014 (the date the Company acquired GMFS) to December 31, 2014.\nOther Expenses\nLoan Servicing Fees. For the year ended December 31, 2015, loan servicing fees were $2.6 million, as compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in loan servicing fees was due to a full year of servicing fees incurred in 2015 related to the acquisition of additional whole loans in March 2014 and increased servicing advances.\nTransaction Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2015, transaction costs were $1.2 million as compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in transaction costs was largely attributable to due diligence costs and professional fees of $2.2 million related to the Company's acquisition of GMFS incurred in 2014, which were partially offset by an increase in transaction costs in 2015 relating to the strategic alternatives being considered by the Company.\nAmortization Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015, amortization expense was $0.8 million as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is due to the amortization of the other intangible assets relating to the Company's acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014.\nRealized and Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss\nThe following amounts related to realized gains and losses, as well as changes in the estimated fair value of the Company's investment portfolio, which consists of mortgage loans, RMBS, Other Investment Securities, real estate owned and derivative instruments, are included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in unrealized gain or loss on mortgage loans held for investment </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,369 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,814 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in unrealized gain or loss on real estate securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,851 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,994 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in unrealized gain or loss on Other Investment Securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(334 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(226 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in unrealized gain or loss on real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(435 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(504 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized gain on mortgage loans held for investment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,839 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized gain on real estate securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized (loss)/gain on Other Investment Securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(155 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Realized (loss)/gain on real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(160 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on derivative instruments related to investment portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(172 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,921 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total other (losses)/gains </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,978 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,931 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere was no other than temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) for RMBS for the years ended December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014.\nThe Company's interest rate swap agreements and interest rate swaption agreement have not been designated as hedging instruments.\nThe Company recorded in earnings as loss on derivative instruments the change in fair value related to (i) an interest rate swaption agreement held during the year ended December 31, 2014 (ii) interest rate swap agreements held during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 (iii) LPCs held during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and (iv) the conversion option related to the Exchangeable Senior Notes held during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The loss on derivative instruments also includes the net interest rate swap payments for the derivative instruments.\nThe Company has elected to record the change in fair value related to certain mortgage loans held for investment, mortgage loans held for sale, RMBS, Other Investment Securities and MSRs in earnings by electing the fair value option.\nDividends\nDuring 2015, the Company declared the following dividends:\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>Declaration Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount per\nShare and\nOP Unit </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 19, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>April 15, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>June 18, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>July 15, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 17, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>October 15, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 17, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 15, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following analysis focuses on the results generated during the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nNet Interest Income\nThe Company's interest income is comprised of interest income generated from the Company's mortgage loans held for investment, mortgage loans held for sale, non-Agency RMBS and Other Investment Securities. The Company's interest expense is related to the Company's warehouse lines of credit, the Loan Repurchase Facilities, securities repurchase agreements and the Exchangeable Senior Notes.\nThe Company's net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was as follows:\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,418 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,094 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,324 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in interest income was due to having a fully levered portfolio primarily allocated to residential mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the first half of the prior year when the Company had more of its equity allocated to RMBS. The purchase of whole loans into the portfolio resulted in a $16.3 million increase in interest income in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest income from the RMBS portfolio of $1.1 million primarily due to the reallocation of capital to whole loans consistent with the Company's investment strategy and the sales of RMBS during the three months ended December 31, 2014 to fund the acquisition of GMFS.\nThe increase in interest expense was due to (i) an increase in interest expense of $0.1 million related to an increase in borrowings on the warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements used to finance the Company's mortgage loans held for sale; (ii) an increase in interest expense of $5.3 million related to an increase in borrowings on the Company's Loan Repurchase Facilities used to finance the Company's residential mortgage loans held for investment; and (iii) an increase in interest expense of $5.1 million related to the issuance of the Exchangeable Senior Notes, offset by a decrease in interest expense of $0.4 million related to a decrease in borrowings on the securities repurchase agreements.\nNet interest income is subject to interest rate risk. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K, for more information relating to interest rate risk and its impact on the Company's operating results.\nThe weighted average net interest spreads between the yield on the Company's assets and the cost of funds, including the impact of interest rate hedging, for the Company's mortgage loans held for investment, non-Agency RMBS and Other Investment Securities at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows:\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgage loans Held for Investment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.91 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-Agency RMBS and Other Investment Securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's net interest income is also impacted by prepayment speeds, as measured by the weighted average CPR on its assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expenses were $3.2 million as compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The Company uses significant cash to purchase assets, pay dividends, repay principal and interest on its borrowings, fund its operations and meet other general business needs. The Company's primary sources of liquidity are its existing cash balances, borrowings under warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements related to the GMFS mortgage banking platform, the Loan Repurchase Facilities, securities repurchase agreements, the net proceeds from offerings of equity and debt securities, notes issued by the Operating Partnership, net cash provided by operating activities, additional private funding sources, including other borrowings structured as repurchase agreements, term financings and derivative agreements, and future issuances of common equity, preferred equity, convertible securities, exchangeable notes, trust preferred and/or debt securities.\nThe borrowings the Company used to fund the purchase of its mortgage loans held for investment and RMBS totaled $426.6 million, at December 31, 2015 under the Loan Repurchase Facilities, master securities repurchase agreements with four counterparties and the Exchangeable Senior Notes. Additionally, the borrowings GMFS used to fund its origination platform totaled $100.8 million at December 31, 2015 under its warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements with four lenders.\nLoan Repurchase Facilities and Securities Repurchase Facilities\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had a total of $394.9 million in fair value of trust certificates representing interests in residential mortgage loans (the \"Trust Certificates\") pledged against its borrowings under the Loan Repurchase Facilities, $95.6 million in fair value of RMBS and $2.0 million of Other Investment Securities pledged against its securities repurchase agreement borrowings, and GMFS had $116.0 million in fair value of mortgage loans held for sale pledged against its repurchase agreement borrowings and warehouse lines of credit.\nUnder the repurchase agreements, the Company may be required to pledge additional assets to its counterparties (lenders) in the event that the fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral, which may take the form of additional assets or cash. Generally, the Company's repurchase agreements contain a LIBOR-based financing rate, term and haircuts depending on the types of collateral and the counterparties involved. Further, at December 31, 2015, the range of haircut provisions associated with the Company's repurchase agreements was between 10% and 28% for pledged Trust Certificates, 15% and 35% for pledged non-Agency RMBS, and 0% and 5% for pledged mortgage loans held for sale. The haircut provision associated with the Company's repurchase agreements for Other Investment Securities was 30%.\nThe Loan Repurchase Facilities contain covenants that include certain financial requirements, including maintenance of minimum liquidity, minimum tangible net worth and maximum debt to net worth ratio, as defined in the agreements. Additionally, the repurchase agreements used to finance the Company's mortgages held for sale contain covenants that include certain financial requirements, including maintenance of minimum liquidity, minimum tangible net worth, maximum debt to net worth ratio and current ratio and limitations on capital expenditures, indebtedness, distributions, transactions with affiliates and maintenance of positive net income, as defined in the agreements. The Company was in compliance with all significant debt covenants as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the fair value of the assets increases due to changes in market interest rates or market factors, lenders may release collateral back to the Company. Specifically, margin calls may result from a decline in the value of the investments securing the Company's repurchase agreements, prepayments on the mortgages securing such investments and from changes in the fair value of such investments generally due to principal reduction of such investments from scheduled amortization and resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors. Counterparties also may choose to increase haircuts based on credit evaluations of the Company and/or the performance of the assets in question. Historically disruptions in the financial and credit markets have resulted in increased volatility in these levels, and this volatility could persist as market conditions continue to change rapidly. Should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying the Company's investments or market interest rates suddenly increase, margin calls on the Company's repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in its liquidity position. To date, the Company has satisfied all of its margin calls and has never sold assets in response to any margin call under these borrowings.\nThe Loan Repurchase Facilities are used to fund purchases of the Company's mortgage loans held for investment. The Citi Loan Repurchase Facility closed on May 30, 2013 with a borrowing capacity of $250.0 million, of which $150.0 million was committed for a period of 364 days from inception. On March 27, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment of the Citi Loan Repurchase Facility providing it with an additional $75.0 million of uncommitted borrowing capacity. On May 22, 2015 the Company entered into an amendment with Citi extending the termination date of the facility to May 20, 2016. The obligations are fully guaranteed by the Company. The Company is required to pay Citi a commitment fee, as well as certain other administrative costs and expenses in connection with Citi's structuring, management and ongoing administration of the Citi Loan Repurchase Facility.\nOn August 14, 2014, the Company entered into the Credit Suisse Loan Repurchase Facility, pursuant to which the Company may sell, and later repurchase, a trust certificate representing ownership interests in a trust holding residential mortgage loans in aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million, all of which was committed. The Credit Suisse Loan Repurchase Facility was committed for a period of 364 days from inception and the obligations are fully guaranteed by the Company. On June 29, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment with Credit Suisse to reduce the committed amount to $25.0 million and extend the maturity date to June 27, 2016. The Company is required to pay Credit Suisse a commitment fee, as well as certain other administrative costs and expenses in connection with Credit Suisse's structuring, management and ongoing administration of the Credit Suisse Loan Repurchase Facility.\nThe Company's borrowings under repurchase agreements are renewable at the discretion of its lenders and, as such, the Company's ability to roll-over such borrowings is not guaranteed. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under the Company's repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by SIFMA, as to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all assets the Company has initially sold under the repurchase transaction. In addition, each lender typically requires that the Company include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions, which differ by lender, may include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts and purchase price maintenance requirements, requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction, and cross default and setoff provisions.\nLoan Repurchase Facilities\nThe following

of Credit\nThe borrowings GMFS used to fund its origination platform totaled $100.8 million at December 31, 2015, which includes borrowings under repurchase agreements with two lenders totaling $42.7 million. GMFS has a master repurchase agreement in aggregate principal amount of up to $65.0 million, of which the entire $65.0 million is committed, expiring on November 25, 2016. GMFS also has a master repurchase agreement in aggregate principal amount of up to $20.0 million, of which the entire $20.0 million is committed, expiring on June 30, 2016.\nIn addition to the repurchase agreements described above, GMFS funds its origination platform through warehouse lines of credit with two counterparties with total borrowings outstanding of $58.1 million at December 31, 2015. GMFS has a $60.0 million committed warehouse line of credit agreement expiring on September 26, 2016 and a $40.0 committed warehouse line of credit expiring on August 13, 2016. The lines are collateralized by the underlying mortgages and related documents and instruments and contain a LIBOR-based financing rate and term, haircut and collateral posting provisions which depend on the types of collateral and the counterparties involved. These agreements contain covenants that include certain financial requirements, including maintenance of minimum liquidity, minimum tangible net worth, maximum debt to net worth ratio and current ratio and limitations on capital expenditures, indebtedness, distributions, transactions with affiliates and maintenance of positive net income, as defined in the agreements. The Company was in compliance with all significant debt covenants for the years ended December 31, 2015 and at December 31, 2014.\nThe following tables present certain information regarding the Company's warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements in its residential mortgage banking segment at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Availability </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Counterparties </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted\nAverage Rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>30 days or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>31 - 90 days </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>181 days to 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Greater than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total balance and weighted average rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.72 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements are secured by the Company's mortgage loans held for sale and bear interest at a rate that has historically moved in close relationship to LIBOR.\nExchangeable Senior Notes\nOn November 25, 2013, the Operating Partnership issued the Exchangeable Senior Notes, which may be exchanged for shares of the Company's common stock or, to the extent necessary to satisfy NYSE listing requirements, cash, at the applicable exchange rate at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day prior to November 15, 2016 (the Maturity Date\u201d). The Company may not elect to issue shares of common stock upon exchange of the Exchangeable Senior Notes to the extent such election would result in the issuance of 20% or more of the common stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of the Exchangeable Senior Notes (or 1,779,560 or more shares). The initial exchange rate for each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes was 52.5417 shares of common stock, equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $19.03 per share, representing an approximate 15% premium to the last reported sale price of the common stock on November 19, 2013 (the date of the initial sale of the Exchangeable Senior Notes), which was $16.55 per share. The exchange rate will be subject to adjustment for certain events, including for regular quarterly dividends in excess of $0.50 per share, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if certain corporate events occur prior to the Maturity Date, the exchange rate will be increased but will in no event exceed 60.4229 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes due in 2016. The exchange rate was adjusted on December 27, 2013 to 54.3103 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Senior Notes pursuant to the Company's special dividend of $0.55 per common share and OP Unit declared on December 19, 2013. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement, the Company agreed to file with the SEC within 120 days from the issue date, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective within 180 days, a shelf registration statement with respect to the resales of the Company's common stock that may be issued upon exchange of the Exchangeable Senior Notes. The Company filed this shelf registration statement with the SEC on March 14, 2014, and the SEC declared it effective on May 23, 2014. If the Company fails to comply with certain of its obligations under the registration rights agreement, the Company will be required to pay liquidated damages to holders of the Exchangeable Senior Notes. The Company will increase the exchange rate by 3% for holders that exchange the Exchangeable Senior Notes when a registration default exists with respect to shares of the Company's common stock.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had Exchangeable Senior Notes outstanding totaling $57.5 million of aggregate principal balance which matures on the Maturity Date. The Exchangeable Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.0% per year payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2014. The effective interest rate of the Exchangeable Senior Notes, which is equal to the stated rate of 8.0% plus the amortization of the original issue discount and associated costs, is 10.2%.\nThe Exchangeable Senior Notes will mature on the Maturity Date, unless previously exchanged or repurchased in accordance with their terms. If the Company undergoes certain corporate events, that constitute a \"fundamental change,\" the holders of the Exchangeable Senior Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Exchangeable Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The Company is currently evaluating alternatives to settle the obligation at maturity in light of the pending strategic review.\nFor additional information related to the Exchangeable Senior Notes, see \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-8.0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2016.\"\nDerivative Instruments\nResidential Mortgage Investments Segment\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements designed to mitigate the effects of increases in interest rates under a portion of its repurchase agreements. These interest rate swap agreements provide for the Company to pay fixed interest rates and receive floating interest rates indexed to LIBOR. The swap agreements effectively fixed the floating interest rates on a portion of the borrowings under the Company's repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2014, the Company also had an interest rate swaption agreement outstanding which gave the Company the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a previously agreed upon interest rate swap contract on a future date which would obligate the Company to pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a floating rate of interest. The swaption matured in January 2015.\nThe following table presents information about the Company's interest rate swaption agreement at December 31, 2014:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>Swaption Expiration </td> <td> </td> <td>Notional\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Strike Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Swap Maturity </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents information about the Company's interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notional Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted Average Pay Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.72 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.72 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted Average Receive Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted Average Years to Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company also had outstanding loan purchase commitments ( LPCs\u201d), interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs\u201d) and MBS forward sales contracts.\nThe Company enters into LPCs as a means to avoid interest rate risk. The LPCs are pursuant to Master Loan Purchase Agreements with approved, third party residential loan originators to purchase residential loans, which meet the guidelines established by the Company, at a future date. These best efforts\u201d contracts provide that the loan be delivered if and when it closes and are subject to pair off\u201d fees if the loan is not delivered by the seller.\nThe Company had no exposure to TBA contracts at any time during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 the Company did not have any TBA contracts outstanding.\nResidential Mortgage Banking Segment\nThe Company enters into IRLCs to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time (generally between 30 and 90 days), with customers who have applied for a loan and meet certain credit and underwriting criteria.\nThe Company manages the interest rate price risk associated with its outstanding IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale by entering into derivative instruments such as MBS forward sales contracts. The Company expects these derivatives will experience changes in fair value opposite to changes in the fair value of the IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale, thereby reducing earnings volatility. The Company takes into account various factors and strategies in determining the portion of the IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale it wants to economically hedge.\nThe following table summarizes information related to the Company's LPCs, IRLCs and MBS forward sales contracts at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>Non-hedge derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollar amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LPCs (Principal balance of underlying loans) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,905 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>IRLCs (Principal balance of underlying loans) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>190,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Notional amount of MBS forward sales contracts </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>179,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe notional amount is not representative of the maximum exposure to the Company.\nSee Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 24 - Offsetting Assets and Liabilities\u201d included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K for discussion about the Company's master netting arrangements.\nLeverage Ratio\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had a leverage ratio of 2.97x. The leverage ratio is the ratio of the warehouse lines of credit, Loan Repurchase Facilities, securities repurchase agreements and Exchangeable Senior Notes (including the conversion option which is part of the notes) to the Company's stockholders equity.\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company maintains certain assets, which, from time to time, may include cash, unpledged mortgage loans, non-Agency RMBS and Other Investment Securities (which may be subject to various haircuts if pledged as collateral to meet margin requirements) and collateral in excess of margin requirements held by the Company's counterparties (collectively, the \"Cushion\") to meet routine margin calls and protect against unforeseen reductions in the Company's borrowing capabilities. The Company's ability to meet future margin calls will be impacted by the Cushion, which varies based on the fair value of its assets, its cash position and margin requirements. The Company's cash position fluctuates based on the timing of its operating, investing and financing activities and is managed based on the Company's anticipated cash needs. At December 31, 2015, the Company had a Cushion of $25.0 million in addition to certain reserves held with respect to the Loan Repurchase Facilities. The Company's calculation of its Cushion excludes GMFS's warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had a total of $4.4 million of restricted cash pledged against its interest rate swaps and repurchase agreements related to its mortgage loans held for investment and RMBS portfolios.\nThe Company believes these identified sources of liquidity will be adequate for purposes of meeting its short-term (within one year) liquidity and long-term liquidity needs. However, the Company's ability to meet its long-term liquidity and capital resource requirements may require additional financing.\nThe Company's short-term and long-term liquidity needs include funding future investments and operating costs. In addition, to qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute annually at least 90% of its net taxable income, excluding net capital gains. These distribution requirements limit the Company's ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations.\nGMFS Transaction\nPursuant to the GMFS Merger Agreement the Company merged with and into GMFS, with GMFS surviving the merger as an indirect subsidiary of the Company (see Item 1, Business,\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K). The transaction closed on October 31, 2014. The final purchase price was approximately $61.2 million which was comprised of (i) the fair market value of GMFS's MSR portfolio, (ii) the fair market value of GMFS's net tangible assets and (iii) a purchase price premium. In addition to cash paid at closing, the total consideration included two contingent $1 million deferred premium payments payable in cash over two years, plus the Production and Profitability Earn-Out. The $2 million of deferred premium payments is contingent on GMFS remaining profitable and retaining certain key employees. The Production and Profitability Earn-Out is dependent on GMFS achieving certain profitability and loan production goals and is capped at $20 million. Up to 50% of the Production and Profitability Earn-Out may be paid in common stock of the Company, at the Company's option. The estimated present value of the total contingent consideration at October 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 was $11.4 million and $11.3 million, respectively, based on the future production and earnings projections of GMFS over the four-year earn-out period. The Company funded the closing cash payment through a combination of available cash and the liquidation of a portion of its non-Agency RMBS portfolio.\nAs disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2015, GMFS had executed a statute of limitations tolling agreement with at least one counterparty with respect to mortgage loans that were sold by GMFS to this counterparty's predecessor. This tolling agreement extends the time period which this counterparty could bring claim against GMFS.\nThe initial tolling agreement was executed by GMFS on December 12, 2013 and then further amended to extend the expiration date. Based on communications received in April 2015 from this counterparty, the Company believes that when this tolling agreement expires, absent further extension of the tolling agreement or settlement of the counterparty's claims, it is probable that the counterparty will initiate litigation against GMFS seeking substantial damages based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties made by GMFS. The most recent amendment of the tolling agreement extended the expiration date to June 2, 2016 and can be further extended by agreement of the parties. The Company also understands that this counterparty has commenced or threatened litigation arising out of historical mortgage loan purchases by its predecessor against a number of other mortgage loan originators. The Company estimates that dating back to a period that began approximately 16 years ago in 1999 and ended in 2006, approximately $1 billion of mortgage loans were sold servicing released by GMFS to the predecessor to this counterparty. While the historical claims experience of GMFS with respect to purchasers of mortgage loans from GMFS over the 1999 to 2006 period has not resulted in material damages claimed against or paid by GMFS, as further disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2015, claims brought by this counterparty could expose GMFS to substantial damages that may be material, cause the Company and GMFS to devote significant management time and attention and other resources to resolving or defending these claims, require GMFS, the Company or its other subsidiaries to incur significant costs, or cause significant losses that may be material.\nAlthough the Company has established a loan indemnification reserve for potential losses related to loan sale representations and warranties with a corresponding provision recorded for loan losses due to the early stage of this matter and the limited information available the Company is not able to determine the likelihood of the outcome. The Company believes that losses in excess of the loan indemnification reserve will be recovered by the Company as either a reduction of the total contingent consideration owed under the GMFS Merger Agreement given the indemnification provisions in the GMFS Merger Agreement or by withdrawing funds from an escrow account established by the sellers at the time of the acquisition (as of December 31, 2015, the balance in the escrow account was $4,004,424). Additionally, the Company has delayed the first year installment payment of the contingent consideration. Losses in excess of the loan indemnification reserve, total contingent consideration and the escrow account could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In the event of litigation or settlement with the counterparty, the Company intends to pursue claims against the sellers of GMFS seeking indemnification for any losses or any amounts paid in settlement, although there can be no assurance that such claims would be successful or that any amounts available for indemnification would be adequate.\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividends\nThe Company's current policy is to pay quarterly distributions which will allow it to qualify as a REIT and generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its undistributed income. Taxable and U.S. GAAP earnings will typically differ due to differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, certain non-taxable unrealized and realized gains and losses, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses.\nIn light of the strategic review and in order to reduce current market risk in its investment portfolio, the Company has recently begun the process of selling its seasoned, re-performing mortgage loans from its residential mortgage investments segment. A sale of these assets is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, as part of the strategic review, the Company has made the decision to cease the purchase of newly originated residential mortgage loans as part of its mortgage conduit program and will begin the unwinding of the Company's mortgage conduit business. If completed, these transactions are likely to result in a reduction of the Company's investment income and may therefore result in a decision to curtail dividends in the future.\nCash (Used In) Provided by Operating Activities\nThe Company's cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows:\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>(23,081 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,690 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,131 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cash flows (used in)/provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 are primarily a result of income earned on the Company's assets, partially offset by interest expense on the Company's borrowings and operating expenses. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of GMFS, cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are also impacted by the origination of mortgage loans held for sale and an increase in MSRs offset by non-interest income and proceeds from the sale of these mortgage loans.\n\t\nCash Provided By (Used in) Investing Activities\nThe cash flows

GMFS, a mortgage banking platform the Company acquired in October 2014, originates, sells and services mortgage loans and the Company acquires performing, re-performing and newly originated loans through other channels. The Company also invests in, finances and manages non-Agency RMBS with an emphasis on securities that, when originally issued, were rated in the highest rating category by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and MSRs. The Company also has the discretion to invest in Agency RMBS, including through TBA contracts, and in other real estate-related and financial assets, such as IOs. The Company refers collectively to its assets as its 'target assets'.\nAs announced on November 4, 2015, the Company has engaged a financial advisor to assist in evaluating potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. The continuing strategic review includes the exploration of merger or sale transactions involving the Company or a liquidation of the Company's assets. The Company and its financial advisor have engaged in preliminary discussions with several potential counterparties. While the Company is currently engaged in discussions with a potential counterparty about a potential merger or sale transaction, there is no assurance that the discussions will lead to a definitive merger or sale transaction, which would be subject to approval by the Company's board of directors and its stockholders. In the event that the Company does not reach a definitive agreement with respect to a merger or sale transaction, management of the Company intends to present to the Company's board of directors for its consideration a plan of liquidation. There is no assurance that the Company's board of directors will approve any plan of liquidation and recommend its acceptance by the Company's stockholders. In light of the strategic review and in order to reduce current market risk in its investment portfolio, the Company has recently begun the process of selling its seasoned, re-performing mortgage loans from its residential mortgage investments segment. A sale of these assets is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2016. If completed, these mortgage loan sales are likely to result in a reduction of the Company's investment income and may therefore result in a decision to curtail dividends in the future. Additionally, as part of the strategic review, the Company has made the decision to cease the purchase of newly originated residential mortgage loans as part of its mortgage conduit purchase program and will begin the unwinding of the Company's mortgage conduit business. Consistent with these changes to the Company's strategy, on March 9, 2016, Brian Hargrave resigned as the Company's Chief Investment Officer and will be succeeded by Christian Zugel, the current Chairman of the Company's board of directors. The Company does not intend to disclose further developments until the review is complete and the Company's board of directors has taken action with respect to the strategic review.\nThe Company's income is generated primarily by the net spread between the income it earns on its assets and the cost of its financing and hedging activities in its residential mortgage investments segment, and the origination, sale and servicing of residential mortgage loans in its residential mortgage banking segment. The Company's objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders, primarily through quarterly distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation.\n 52 \nThe Company was incorporated in Maryland on May 24, 2011 and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2011. The Company is organized in a format pursuant to which it serves as the general partner of, and conducts substantially all of its business through, its Operating Partnership subsidiary, ZAIS Financial Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. The Company is externally managed by the Advisor, a subsidiary of ZAIS, and has no employees except for those employed by GMFS, its wholly-owned subsidiary. GMFS had 246 employees at December 31, 2015. The Company also expects to operate its business so that it is not required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act.\nPursuant to the terms of the GMFS Merger Agreement among Honeybee TRS, Honeybee Acquisitions, GMFS, and Honeyrep, LLC, solely in its capacity as the security holder representative, Honeybee Acquisitions merged with and into GMFS on October 31, 2014, with GMFS continuing as the surviving entity and an indirect subsidiary of the Company. GMFS is an approved Fannie Mae Seller-Servicer, Freddie Mac Seller-Servicer, Ginnie Mae issuer, HUD/FHA Mortgagee, USDA approved originator and VA Lender. GMFS currently originates loans that are eligible to be purchased, guaranteed or insured by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA and USDA through retail, correspondent and broker channels. GMFS also originates and sells reverse mortgage loans as part of its existing operations.\nThe final purchase price was approximately $61.2 million, net of approximately $1.7 million received from an escrow account pursuant to the GMFS Merger Agreement, based on the final reconciliation of GMFS's net tangible assets. The net tangible assets at closing were comprised of the estimated fair value of GMFS's MSR portfolio, the estimated value of GMFS's net tangible assets and a purchase price premium. In addition to cash paid at closing, two contingent $1 million deferred premium payments payable in cash over two years, plus the Production and Profitability Earn-Out. The $2 million of deferred premium payments is contingent on GMFS remaining profitable and retaining certain key employees. The Production and Profitability Earn-Out is dependent on GMFS achieving certain profitability and loan production goals and is capped at $20 million. Up to 50% of the Production and Profitability Earn-Out may be paid in common stock of the Company, at the Company's option. The estimated present value of the total contingent consideration at October 31, 2014 was $11.4 million based on the future production and earnings projections of GMFS over the four-year earn-out period (at December 31, 2015 the contingent consideration liability was $11.3 million). The Company funded the closing cash payment through a combination of available cash and the sale of a portion of its non-Agency RMBS portfolio. As discussed above, pursuant to the GMFS Merger Agreement, based on the final reconciliation of the October 31, 2014 values, the Company received $1,684,263 in June 2015 from an escrow account established at the time of the closing. The Company recorded a reduction to goodwill in the consolidated balance sheets that included this amount, along with other final closing adjustments. Additionally, in 2015 the goodwill and other intangible assets were measured for impairment. The Company determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of these assets are recoverable and therefore, the Company did not recognize any impairment of these assets under U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company is externally managed by the Advisor, a subsidiary of ZAIS. On March 17, 2015, a business combination was completed between HF2 Financial, a special purpose acquisition company, and ZGP, which wholly owns ZAIS, pursuant to a definitive agreement dated September 16, 2014. The current owners of ZGP did not receive any proceeds at the closing of the transaction and retained a significant equity stake in ZGP. Following the close of the transaction, ZAIS's management team has remained in place to continue to lead the combined organization.\nThe Company operated as one operating segment prior to the acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014. Subsequent to the acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014, the Company operates in two operating segments: residential mortgage investments and residential mortgage banking. These operating segments have been identified based on the Company's organizational and management structure. These segments are based on an internally-aligned segment structure, which is how the Company's results are monitored and performance is assessed.\nThe residential mortgage investments segment includes a portfolio of mortgage loans which were either distressed, re-performing or newly originated at the time of purchase. The residential mortgage banking segment includes the operations of GMFS, which originates mortgage loans for subsequent sale as either servicing retained or released, and expenses incurred by ZFC Honeybee TRS, LLC.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company held a diversified portfolio of mortgage loans, RMBS and MSRs with an aggregate fair value of $671.2 million, comprised of the following:\nResidential Mortgage Investments\n \u00b7 Performing, re-performing and newly originated loans with a fair value of $397.7 million; \n \u00b7 RMBS assets with a fair value of $109.3 million, consisting primarily of senior tranches of non-Agency RMBS that were originally highly rated but subsequently downgraded and, \nResidential Mortgage Banking\n \u00b7 Mortgage loans originated by the GMFS mortgage banking platform and held for sale with a fair value of $116.0 million; and \n \u00b7 MSRs with a fair value of $48.2 million. \n 53 \nFactors Impacting Operating Results\nThe Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were impacted by a number of factors. Home prices, which are a significant correlating factor to the Company's performance, rose 5.25% for the 12 months ended November 2015 according to Case Shiller (20 City Index, seasonally adjusted). In addition, as the housing markets continue to recover from the credit crisis, most housing metrics continue to improve including: the level of distressed homes for sale, delinquencies and foreclosures. Interest rates moved modestly higher during the year, and in December the Federal Reserve initiated its first increase in the federal funds target rate since the financial crisis. This served to raise short-term borrowing costs and was largely in line with market expectations. Fixed income market volatility increased during the second half of the year, in particular in the high yield corporate debt markets. This caused some spread widening in most fixed income credit sectors, including non-Agency RMBS. The market for residential mortgage loans was also somewhat negatively impacted by these market dynamics. Labor market conditions showed improvement and a benign inflation environment continued, all of which are supportive of mortgage credit performance. The RMBS and whole loan portfolios saw a decline in market value during the year.\nThe Company expects that the results of its operations will also be affected by a number of other factors, including the level of its net interest income, the fair value of its assets and the supply of, and demand for, the target assets in which it may invest. The Company's net interest income, which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, varies, primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds, as measured by Constant Prepayment Rates ( CPR\u201d) on the Company's target assets. Interest rates and prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. The Company's operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are held directly by the Company or included in its non-Agency RMBS or Other Investment Securities or in other assets it may originate or acquire.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company held a diversified portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment with a fair value of $397.7 million, mortgage loans held for sale with a fair value of $116.0 million, RMBS assets with a fair value of $109.3 million and MSRs with a fair value of $48.2 million.\nChanges in Fair Value of the Company's Assets\nThe Company's mortgage loans held for investment, mortgage loans held for sale, RMBS and Other Investment Securities are carried at fair value and future mortgage-related assets may also be carried at fair value. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the Company's assets may impact the results of its operations for the period in which such change in value occurs. The expectation of changes in real estate prices is a major determinant of the value of mortgage loans and, therefore, of RMBS and Other Investment Securities. This factor is beyond the Company's control.\nChanges in Market Interest Rates\nWith respect to the Company's business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may, over time, cause: (i) the interest expense associated with the Company's borrowings to increase; (ii) the value of its fixed-rate portfolio to decline; (iii) coupons on its ARMs and hybrid ARMs (including RMBS secured by such collateral) and on its residential mortgage loans and other floating rate securities to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (iv) prepayments on its residential mortgage investments and RMBS to slow, thereby slowing the amortization of the Company's purchase premiums and the accretion of its purchase discounts; (v) a decrease in the Company's mortgage banking origination volume and operating activities; (vi) the value of its interest rate swap agreements to increase; and (vii) the value of its MSRs to increase.\nConversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may, over time, cause: (i) prepayments on the Company's residential mortgage investments and RMBS to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of its purchase premiums and the accretion of its purchase discounts; (ii) the interest expense associated with its borrowings to decrease; (iii) the value of its fixed-rate portfolio to increase; (iv) the value of its interest rate swap agreements to decrease; (v) coupons on its ARMs and hybrid ARMs held for investment (including RMBS secured by such collateral) and other floating rate securities to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; (vi) an increase in the Company's mortgage banking origination volume and operating activities; and (vii) the value of its MSRs to decrease. At December 31, 2015, 36.4% of the Company's performing mortgage loans held for investment, as measured by fair value consisted of mortgage loans with a variable interest rate component, including ARMs and hybrid ARMs. At December 31, 2015, 36.7% of the Company's RMBS assets, as measured by fair value, consisted of RMBS assets with a variable interest rate component, including ARMs and hybrid ARMs. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, 100.0 % of the Company's Other Investment Securities, as measured by fair value, consisted of the Fannie Mae Risk Transfer Notes ( FMSA Notes\u201d) and the Freddie Mac Structured Agency Credit Risk Notes ( FMRT Notes\u201d) with a variable interest rate component.\nPrepayment Speeds\nPrepayment speeds on residential mortgage loans, and therefore, RMBS and MSRs vary according to interest rates, the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition, defaults, foreclosures and other factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty. In general, when interest rates rise, it is relatively less attractive for borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans and, as a result, prepayment speeds tend to decrease. This can extend the period over which the Company earns interest income. When interest rates fall, prepayment speeds on residential mortgage loans, and therefore, RMBS and MSRs tend to increase, thereby decreasing the period over which the Company earns interest income. Additionally, other factors such as the credit rating of the borrower, the rate of home price appreciation or depreciation, financial market conditions, foreclosures and lender competition, none of which can be predicted with any certainty, may affect prepayment speeds on residential mortgage loans, RMBS and MSRs.\n 54 \nSpreads on Non-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans Held for Investment and Securities\nSince the financial crisis that began in 2007, the spreads between swap rates and residential mortgage loans and non-Agency RMBS have been volatile. Spreads on these assets initially moved wider due to the difficult credit conditions and have only recovered a portion of that widening. As the prices of securitized assets declined, a number of investors and a number of structured investment vehicles faced margin calls from dealers and were forced to sell assets in order to reduce leverage. The price volatility of these assets also impacted lending terms in the repurchase market, as counterparties raised margin requirements to reflect the more difficult environment. The spread between the yield on the Company's assets and its funding costs is an important factor in the performance of this aspect of the Company's business. Wider spreads imply greater income on new asset purchases but may have a negative impact on the Company's stated book value. Wider spreads generally negatively impact asset prices. In an environment where spreads are widening, counterparties may require additional collateral to secure borrowings, which may require the Company to reduce leverage by selling assets. Conversely, tighter spreads imply lower income on new asset purchases, but may have a positive impact on the Company's stated book value. Tighter spreads generally have a positive impact on asset prices. In this case, the Company may be able to reduce the amount of collateral required to secure borrowings.\nMortgage Extension Risk\nThe Advisor computes the projected weighted-average life of the Company's investments based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages and the rate at which defaults, foreclosures and recoveries will occur. In general, when the Company originates or acquires a fixed-rate mortgage or hybrid ARM asset, the Company may, but is not required to, enter into an interest rate swap agreement, MBS forward sales contract or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes the Company's borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed-rate portion of the related assets. This strategy is designed to protect the Company from rising interest rates, because the borrowing costs are effectively fixed for the duration of the fixed-rate portion of the related RMBS.\nHowever, if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment, the life of the fixed-rate portion of the related assets could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument. This could have a negative impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the maturity or termination of hedging instruments while the income earned on the assets would remain fixed. This situation may also cause the fair value of the Company's assets to decline, with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions. In extreme situations, the Company may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause the Company to incur losses.\nIn addition, the use of this swap hedging strategy effectively limits increases in the Company's book value in a declining rate environment, due to the effectively fixed nature of the Company's hedged borrowing costs. In an extreme rate decline, prepayment rates on the Company's assets might actually result in certain of its assets being fully paid off while the corresponding swap or other hedge instrument remains outstanding. In such a situation, the Company may be forced to liquidate the swap or other hedge instrument at a level that causes it to incur a loss.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company is subject to credit risk in connection with its investments. Although the Company does not expect to encounter credit risk in its Agency RMBS, if any, it does expect to encounter credit risk related to its non-Agency RMBS, mortgage loans and other target assets, including assets it may originate or acquire. Increases in defaults and delinquencies will adversely impact the Company's operating results, while declines in rates of default and delinquencies may improve the Company's operating results from this aspect of its business. The Company is subject to counterparty risk under the FMSA Notes and FMRT Notes if Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, respectively, is unable to perform its obligations under the respective notes.\nA large portion of the mortgage loans held for investment that the Company acquired was current in their payment status at the time of acquisition. The Company calculates delinquency roll rates for its mortgage loan portfolio which represent the percentage of loans, as measured by unpaid principal balance that were in current payment status in the prior month but became delinquent in the measured month. The Company's delinquency roll rates have generally outperformed its model projections from late 2013 when the whole loan portfolio achieved scale through December 31, 2015.\nSize of Investment Portfolio\nThe size of the Company's investment portfolio, as measured by the aggregate principal balance of its mortgage-related securities and the other assets the Company owns, is a key driver of revenues and expenses. The amount of interest income the Company receives and the amount of interest expense to finance these assets is generally dependent on the size of the investment portfolio.\n 55 \nRegulatory Update\nThe Dodd-Frank Act directed the CFPB to integrate certain mortgage loan disclosures under the TILA and the RESPA, and effective October 3, 2015, new disclosure rules went into effect for newly originated residential mortgage loans. These rules include RESPA new consumer disclosure forms, new processes for determining when disclosures must be updated and new timelines for providing disclosure documents to borrowers. The new rules have created the need for substantial system and process changes and new training within the mortgage loan origination industry.\nUnder the direction and guidance of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (\"GSEs\" or \"Agencies\") are developing a common securitization platform (\"CSP\") for their single-family mortgage securitization activities, including the issuance by both GSEs of a single MBS. The CSP is expected to be a common information technology platform that will use industry-standard software, systems and data requirements and will be adaptable for use by other market participants in the future. The CSP is being developed by a joint venture owned by the GSEs and will leverage the GSEs' existing security structures and would encompass many of the pooling features of the current Fannie Mae MBS and more of the disclosure framework of the current Freddie Mac participation certificate. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is expected to make an announcement in 2016 as to the date that Freddie Mac is expected to begin using the CSP as part of its first phase, with Fannie Mae to begin using the CSP at a later time.\nIn October 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced a plan that could ease credit, enabling more people to qualify for mortgages by further relaxing agreements that determine when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can require lenders to buy back bad loans and permitting borrowers to qualify for certain mortgage loans with smaller down payments than are now required. In October 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac further modified their buy back policies (which took effect on January 1, 2016) to provide potential alternatives to repurchase in respect of certain categories of loan defects. These plans and policy changes are designed to provide lenders with more clarity and transparency and to offer reassurances to lenders that fear they could suffer unpredictable losses on the loans that they securitize through the GSEs. It remains unclear which, if any, of the currently proposed legislation or initiatives will be enacted, and, if any legislation or initiatives are enacted, what the impact of such legislation or initiatives will be. For a discussion of additional risks relating to the Company's business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRecent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation\nOn December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act\u201d). The PATH Act changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT shareholders, which are briefly summarized below.\n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT's total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more Taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d) is reduced from 25% to 20%. \n \u00b7 Publicly offered REITs\u201d (which generally include any REIT required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC, including the Company) are no longer subject to the preferential dividend rules for taxable years beginning after 2014. \n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test. However, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of debt instruments that are issued by publicly offered REITs that are not otherwise treated as real estate assets, and interest on debt of a publicly offered REIT will not be qualifying income under the 75% REIT gross income test unless the debt is secured by real property. \n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2015, to the extent rent attributable to personal property is treated as rents from real property (because rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15% of the total rent for the taxable year for such real and personal property), the personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test. Similarly, debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt. \n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax is reduced from ten years to five years. \n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to redetermined services income, \u201d i.e., non-arm's-length income of a REIT's TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents). \n \u00b7 The rate of withholding tax applicable under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ( FIRPTA\u201d) to certain sales and other dispositions of U.S. real property interests ( USRPIs\u201d) by non-U.S. persons, and certain distributions from corporations whose stock may constitute a USRPI, is increased from 10% to 15% for dispositions and distributions occurring after February 16, 2016. \n \u00b7 For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends received from a publicly traded REIT as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. \n \u00b7 Effective December 18, 2015, certain look-through presumption, and other rules will apply for purposes of determining if the Company qualifies as domestically controlled. \n 56 \n \u00b7 For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, certain qualified foreign pension funds\u201d satisfying certain requirements, as well as entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund, are exempt from income and withholding taxes applicable under FIRPTA. In addition, new FIRPTA rules apply to ownership of REIT shares by qualified shareholders,\u201d which generally include publicly traded non-U.S. stockholders meeting certain requirements. \nSelected Financial Highlights\nA summary of the Company's results for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is below, followed by an overview of the market conditions that impacted the Company's results during the year:\n\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company believes that providing investors with Core Earnings, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, gives investors greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company defines Core Earnings as net interest income, plus non-interest income from its mortgage banking platform (excluding the after tax change in fair value of MSRs resulting from changes in values of market related inputs or assumptions used in a valuation model) less total operating expenses (excluding the after tax effect of depreciation and amortization,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

GMFS is an approved Fannie Mae Seller-Servicer, Freddie Mac Seller-Servicer, Ginnie Mae issuer, HUD/FHA Mortgagee, USDA approved originator and VA Lender. GMFS currently originates loans that are eligible to be purchased, guaranteed or insured by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA and USDA through retail, correspondent and broker channels. GMFS also originates and sells reverse mortgage loans as part of its existing operations.\nThe final purchase price was approximately $61.2 million, net of approximately $1.7 million received from an escrow account pursuant to the GMFS Merger Agreement, based on the final reconciliation of GMFS's net tangible assets. The net tangible assets at closing were comprised of the estimated fair value of GMFS's MSR portfolio, the estimated value of GMFS's net tangible assets and a purchase price premium. In addition to cash paid at closing, two contingent $1 million deferred premium payments payable in cash over two years, plus the Production and Profitability Earn-Out. The $2 million of deferred premium payments is contingent on GMFS remaining profitable and retaining certain key employees. The Production and Profitability Earn-Out is dependent on GMFS achieving certain profitability and loan production goals and is capped at $20 million. Up to 50% of the Production and Profitability Earn-Out may be paid in common stock of the Company, at the Company's option. The estimated present value of the total contingent consideration at October 31, 2014 was $11.4 million based on the future production and earnings projections of GMFS over the four-year earn-out period (at December 31, 2015 the contingent consideration liability was $11.3 million). The Company funded the closing cash payment through a combination of available cash and the sale of a portion of its non-Agency RMBS portfolio. As discussed above, pursuant to the GMFS Merger Agreement, based on the final reconciliation of the October 31, 2014 values, the Company received $1,684,263 in June 2015 from an escrow account established at the time of the closing. The Company recorded a reduction to goodwill in the consolidated balance sheets that included this amount, along with other final closing adjustments. Additionally, in 2015 the goodwill and other intangible assets were measured for impairment. The Company determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of these assets are recoverable and therefore, the Company did not recognize any impairment of these assets under U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company is externally managed by the Advisor, a subsidiary of ZAIS. On March 17, 2015, a business combination was completed between HF2 Financial, a special purpose acquisition company, and ZGP, which wholly owns ZAIS, pursuant to a definitive agreement dated September 16, 2014. The current owners of ZGP did not receive any proceeds at the closing of the transaction and retained a significant equity stake in ZGP. Following the close of the transaction, ZAIS's management team has remained in place to continue to lead the combined organization.\nThe Company operated as one operating segment prior to the acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014. Subsequent to the acquisition of GMFS on October 31, 2014, the Company operates in two operating segments: residential mortgage investments and residential mortgage banking. These operating segments have been identified based on the Company's organizational and management structure. These segments are based on an internally-aligned segment structure, which is how the Company's results are monitored and performance is assessed.\nThe residential mortgage investments segment includes a portfolio of mortgage loans which were either distressed, re-performing or newly originated at the time of purchase. The residential mortgage banking segment includes the operations of GMFS, which originates mortgage loans for subsequent sale as either servicing retained or released, and expenses incurred by ZFC Honeybee TRS, LLC.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company held a diversified portfolio of mortgage loans, RMBS and MSRs with an aggregate fair value of $671.2 million, comprised of the following:\nResidential Mortgage Investments\n \u00b7 Performing, re-performing and newly originated loans with a fair value of $397.7 million; \n \u00b7 RMBS assets with a fair value of $109.3 million, consisting primarily of senior tranches of non-Agency RMBS that were originally highly rated but subsequently downgraded and, \nResidential Mortgage Banking\n \u00b7 Mortgage loans originated by the GMFS mortgage banking platform and held for sale with a fair value of $116.0 million; and \n \u00b7 MSRs with a fair value of $48.2 million. \n 53 \nFactors Impacting Operating Results\nThe Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were impacted by a number of factors. Home prices, which are a significant correlating factor to the Company's performance, rose 5.25% for the 12 months ended November 2015 according to Case Shiller (20 City Index, seasonally adjusted). In addition, as the housing markets continue to recover from the credit crisis, most housing metrics continue to improve including: the level of distressed homes for sale, delinquencies and foreclosures. Interest rates moved modestly higher during the year, and in December the Federal Reserve initiated its first increase in the federal funds target rate since the financial crisis. This served to raise short-term borrowing costs and was largely in line with market expectations. Fixed income market volatility increased during the second half of the year, in particular in the high yield corporate debt markets. This caused some spread widening in most fixed income credit sectors, including non-Agency RMBS. The market for residential mortgage loans was also somewhat negatively impacted by these market dynamics. Labor market conditions showed improvement and a benign inflation environment continued, all of which are supportive of mortgage credit performance. The RMBS and whole loan portfolios saw a decline in market value during the year.\nThe Company expects that the results of its operations will also be affected by a number of other factors, including the level of its net interest income, the fair value of its assets and the supply of, and demand for, the target assets in which it may invest. The Company's net interest income, which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, varies, primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds, as measured by Constant Prepayment Rates ( CPR\u201d) on the Company's target assets. Interest rates and prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. The Company's operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are held directly by the Company or included in its non-Agency RMBS or Other Investment Securities or in other assets it may originate or acquire.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company held a diversified portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment with a fair value of $397.7 million, mortgage loans held for sale with a fair value of $116.0 million, RMBS assets with a fair value of $109.3 million and MSRs with a fair value of $48.2 million.\nChanges in Fair Value of the Company's Assets\nThe Company's mortgage loans held for investment, mortgage loans held for sale, RMBS and Other Investment Securities are carried at fair value and future mortgage-related assets may also be carried at fair value. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the Company's assets may impact the results of its operations for the period in which such change in value occurs. The expectation of changes in real estate prices is a major determinant of the value of mortgage loans and, therefore, of RMBS and Other Investment Securities. This factor is beyond the Company's control.\nChanges in Market Interest Rates\nWith respect to the Company's business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may, over time, cause: (i) the interest expense associated with the Company's borrowings to increase; (ii) the value of its fixed-rate portfolio to decline; (iii) coupons on its ARMs and hybrid ARMs (including RMBS secured by such collateral) and on its residential mortgage loans and other floating rate securities to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (iv) prepayments on its residential mortgage investments and RMBS to slow, thereby slowing the amortization of the Company's purchase premiums and the accretion of its purchase discounts; (v) a decrease in the Company's mortgage banking origination volume and operating activities; (vi) the value of its interest rate swap agreements to increase; and (vii) the value of its MSRs to increase.\nConversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may, over time, cause: (i) prepayments on the Company's residential mortgage investments and RMBS to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of its purchase premiums and the accretion of its purchase discounts; (ii) the interest expense associated with its borrowings to decrease; (iii) the value of its fixed-rate portfolio to increase; (iv) the value of its interest rate swap agreements to decrease; (v) coupons on its ARMs and hybrid ARMs held for investment (including RMBS secured by such collateral) and other floating rate securities to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; (vi) an increase in the Company's mortgage banking origination volume and operating activities; and (vii) the value of its MSRs to decrease. At December 31, 2015, 36.4% of the Company's performing mortgage loans held for investment, as measured by fair value consisted of mortgage loans with a variable interest rate component, including ARMs and hybrid ARMs. At December 31, 2015, 36.7% of the Company's RMBS assets, as measured by fair value, consisted of RMBS assets with a variable interest rate component, including ARMs and hybrid ARMs. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, 100.0 % of the Company's Other Investment Securities, as measured by fair value, consisted of the Fannie Mae Risk Transfer Notes ( FMSA Notes\u201d) and the Freddie Mac Structured Agency Credit Risk Notes ( FMRT Notes\u201d) with a variable interest rate component.\nPrepayment Speeds\nPrepayment speeds on residential mortgage loans, and therefore, RMBS and MSRs vary according to interest rates, the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition, defaults, foreclosures and other factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty. In general, when interest rates rise, it is relatively less attractive for borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans and, as a result, prepayment speeds tend to decrease. This can extend the period over which the Company earns interest income. When interest rates fall, prepayment speeds on residential mortgage loans, and therefore, RMBS and MSRs tend to increase, thereby decreasing the period over which the Company earns interest income. Additionally, other factors such as the credit rating of the borrower, the rate of home price appreciation or depreciation, financial market conditions, foreclosures and lender competition, none of which can be predicted with any certainty, may affect prepayment speeds on residential mortgage loans, RMBS and MSRs.\n 54 \nSpreads on Non-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans Held for Investment and Securities\nSince the financial crisis that began in 2007, the spreads between swap rates and residential mortgage loans and non-Agency RMBS have been volatile. Spreads on these assets initially moved wider due to the difficult credit conditions and have only recovered a portion of that widening. As the prices of securitized assets declined, a number of investors and a number of structured investment vehicles faced margin calls from dealers and were forced to sell assets in order to reduce leverage. The price volatility of these assets also impacted lending terms in the repurchase market, as counterparties raised margin requirements to reflect the more difficult environment. The spread between the yield on the Company's assets and its funding costs is an important factor in the performance of this aspect of the Company's business. Wider spreads imply greater income on new asset purchases but may have a negative impact on the Company's stated book value. Wider spreads generally negatively impact asset prices. In an environment where spreads are widening, counterparties may require additional collateral to secure borrowings, which may require the Company to reduce leverage by selling assets. Conversely, tighter spreads imply lower income on new asset purchases, but may have a positive impact on the Company's stated book value. Tighter spreads generally have a positive impact on asset prices. In this case, the Company may be able to reduce the amount of collateral required to secure borrowings.\nMortgage Extension Risk\nThe Advisor computes the projected weighted-average life of the Company's investments based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages and the rate at which defaults, foreclosures and recoveries will occur. In general, when the Company originates or acquires a fixed-rate mortgage or hybrid ARM asset, the Company may, but is not required to, enter into an interest rate swap agreement, MBS forward sales contract or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes the Company's borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed-rate portion of the related assets. This strategy is designed to protect the Company from rising interest rates, because the borrowing costs are effectively fixed for the duration of the fixed-rate portion of the related RMBS.\nHowever, if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment, the life of the fixed-rate portion of the related assets could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument. This could have a negative impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the maturity or termination of hedging instruments while the income earned on the assets would remain fixed. This situation may also cause the fair value of the Company's assets to decline, with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions. In extreme situations, the Company may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause the Company to incur losses.\nIn addition, the use of this swap hedging strategy effectively limits increases in the Company's book value in a declining rate environment, due to the effectively fixed nature of the Company's hedged borrowing costs. In an extreme rate decline, prepayment rates on the Company's assets might actually result in certain of its assets being fully paid off while the corresponding swap or other hedge instrument remains outstanding. In such a situation, the Company may be forced to liquidate the swap or other hedge instrument at a level that causes it to incur a loss.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company is subject to credit risk in connection with its investments. Although the Company does not expect to encounter credit risk in its Agency RMBS, if any, it does expect to encounter credit risk related to its non-Agency RMBS, mortgage loans and other target assets, including assets it may originate or acquire. Increases in defaults and delinquencies will adversely impact the Company's operating results, while declines in rates of default and delinquencies may improve the Company's operating results from this aspect of its business. The Company is subject to counterparty risk under the FMSA Notes and FMRT Notes if Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, respectively, is unable to perform its obligations under the respective notes.\nA large portion of the mortgage loans held for investment that the Company acquired was current in their payment status at the time of acquisition. The Company calculates delinquency roll rates for its mortgage loan portfolio which represent the percentage of loans, as measured by unpaid principal balance that were in current payment status in the prior month but became delinquent in the measured month. The Company's delinquency roll rates have generally outperformed its model projections from late 2013 when the whole loan portfolio achieved scale through December 31, 2015.\nSize of Investment Portfolio\nThe size of the Company's investment portfolio, as measured by the aggregate principal balance of its mortgage-related securities and the other assets the Company owns, is a key driver of revenues and expenses. The amount of interest income the Company receives and the amount of interest expense to finance these assets is generally dependent on the size of the investment portfolio.\n 55 \nRegulatory Update\nThe Dodd-Frank Act directed the CFPB to integrate certain mortgage loan disclosures under the TILA and the RESPA, and effective October 3, 2015, new disclosure rules went into effect for newly originated residential mortgage loans. These rules include RESPA new consumer disclosure forms, new processes for determining when disclosures must be updated and new timelines for providing disclosure documents to borrowers. The new rules have created the need for substantial system and process changes and new training within the mortgage loan origination industry.\nUnder the direction and guidance of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (\"GSEs\" or \"Agencies\") are developing a common securitization platform (\"CSP\") for their single-family mortgage securitization activities, including the issuance by both GSEs of a single MBS. The CSP is expected to be a common information technology platform that will use industry-standard software, systems and data requirements and will be adaptable for use by other market participants in the future. The CSP is being developed by a joint venture owned by the GSEs and will leverage the GSEs' existing security structures and would encompass many of the pooling features of the current Fannie Mae MBS and more of the disclosure framework of the current Freddie Mac participation certificate. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is expected to make an announcement in 2016 as to the date that Freddie Mac is expected to begin using the CSP as part of its first phase, with Fannie Mae to begin using the CSP at a later time.\nIn October 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced a plan that could ease credit, enabling more people to qualify for mortgages by further relaxing agreements that determine when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can require lenders to buy back bad loans and permitting borrowers to qualify for certain mortgage loans with smaller down payments than are now required. In October 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac further modified their buy back policies (which took effect on January 1, 2016) to provide potential alternatives to repurchase in respect of certain categories of loan defects. These plans and policy changes are designed to provide lenders with more clarity and transparency and to offer reassurances to lenders that fear they could suffer unpredictable losses on the loans that they securitize through the GSEs. It remains unclear which, if any, of the currently proposed legislation or initiatives will be enacted, and, if any legislation or initiatives are enacted, what the impact of such legislation or initiatives will be. For a discussion of additional risks relating to the Company's business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRecent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation\nOn December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act\u201d). The PATH Act changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT shareholders, which are briefly summarized below.\n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT's total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more Taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d) is reduced from 25% to 20%. \n \u00b7 Publicly offered REITs\u201d (which generally include any REIT required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC, including the Company) are no longer subject to the preferential dividend rules for taxable years beginning after 2014. \n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test. However, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of debt instruments that are issued by publicly offered REITs that are not otherwise treated as real estate assets, and interest on debt of a publicly offered REIT will not be qualifying income under the 75% REIT gross income test unless the debt is secured by real property. \n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2015, to the extent rent attributable to personal property is treated as rents from real property (because rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15% of the total rent for the taxable year for such real and personal property), the personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test. Similarly, debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt. \n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax is reduced from ten years to five years. \n \u00b7 For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to redetermined services income, \u201d i.e., non-arm's-length income of a REIT's TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents). \n \u00b7 The rate of withholding tax applicable under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ( FIRPTA\u201d) to certain sales and other dispositions of U.S. real property interests ( USRPIs\u201d) by non-U.S. persons, and certain distributions from corporations whose stock may constitute a USRPI, is increased from 10% to 15% for dispositions and distributions occurring after February 16, 2016. \n \u00b7 For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends received from a publicly traded REIT as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. \n \u00b7 Effective December 18, 2015, certain look-through presumption, and other rules will apply for purposes of determining if the Company qualifies as domestically controlled. \n 56 \n \u00b7 For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, certain qualified foreign pension funds\u201d satisfying certain requirements, as well as entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund, are exempt from income and withholding taxes applicable under FIRPTA. In addition, new FIRPTA rules apply to ownership of REIT shares by qualified shareholders,\u201d which generally include publicly traded non-U.S. stockholders meeting certain requirements. \nSelected Financial Highlights\nA summary of the Company's results for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is below, followed by an overview of the market conditions that impacted the Company's results during the year:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. GAAP net (loss)/income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.4) million </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29.9 million </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7.6 million </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. GAAP net (loss)/income per diluted weighted average share outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.16 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Core Earnings </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.5 million </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.9 million </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.7 million </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Core Earnings per diluted weighted average share outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1. 33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Book value per share of common stock and OP Unit, at end of year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.98 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Leverage ratio, at end of year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.97 </td> <td>x </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.84 </td> <td>x </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.42 </td> <td>x </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company believes that providing investors with Core Earnings, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, gives investors greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. The Company defines Core Earnings as net interest income, plus non-interest income from its mortgage banking platform (excluding the after tax change in fair value of MSRs resulting from changes in values of market related inputs or assumptions used in a valuation model) less total operating expenses (excluding the after tax effect of depreciation and amortization,"}
