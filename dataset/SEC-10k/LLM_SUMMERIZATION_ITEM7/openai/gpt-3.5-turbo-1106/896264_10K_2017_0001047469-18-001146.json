Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of USANA's financial condition and results of operations is presented in ten sections:\n\u2022 Overview\n\u2022 Customers\n\u2022 Presentation\n\u2022 Results of Operations\n\u2022 Quarterly Financial Information\n\u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Contingencies\n\u2022 Inflation\n\u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe develop and manufacture high-quality, science-based nutritional and personal care products that are distributed internationally through a network marketing system, which is a form of direct selling. We have chosen this distribution method as we believe it is more conducive to meeting our vision as a company, which is improving the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world. Our customer base includes two types of customers: \"Associates\" and \"Preferred Customers\" referred to together as \"active Customers.\" Associates share in our company vision by acting as independent distributors of our products in addition to purchasing our products for their personal use. Preferred Customers purchase our products strictly for their personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute the products. As of December 30, 2017, we had approximately 565,000 active Customers worldwide.\nCustomers\nBecause we sell our products exclusively to a customer base of independent active Customers, in order to increase net sales, we must either increase the number of, or the productivity of, our active Customers. Increasing the productivity of our active Customers has not been our primary focus. Rather, we seek to increase the number of active Customers who use our products. We believe this focus is more consistent with our vision of improving the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world. Increases or decreases in product sales are typically the result of variations in the volume of product sold relating to fluctuations in the number of active Customers purchasing our products. The number of active Customers is, therefore, used by management as a key non-financial measure. Sales to Associates account for the majority of our product sales, representing 60% of product sales during 2017, with the remainder of sales for this period to Preferred Customers. We have had a long-standing Preferred Customer program around the world, including in China. Historically, we have reported China Preferred Customers, or CPCs, as Associates due to certain attributes of our CPC program. Beginning with our results for the fourth quarter of 2017, however, we now report CPCs as Preferred Customers. This change in reporting has reduced the percentage of product sales we allocate to Associates for China and overall.\nThe tables below summarize the number of active Associates and Preferred Customers and year-over-year percentage growth by geographic region as of the dates indicated (quarterly). These numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand as of the dates indicated. For purposes of this report, we only count as active those Associates and Preferred Customers who have purchased from us at any time during the most recent three-month period as of the date indicated.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

as Associates. Beginning with the results for the fourth quarter of 2017, we now report China Preferred Customers as Preferred Customers. For comparability purposes, we have adjusted the Associate and Preferred Customer counts for the Greater China region for each quarter in 2017 in this table to reflect this change in reporting.\nPresentation\nProduct sales along with the shipping and handling fees billed to our customers are recorded as revenue net of applicable sales discounts when the product is delivered, title has transferred, and the risk of loss passes to the customer. Payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities. Also reflected in net sales is a provision for product returns and allowances, which is estimated based on our historical experience. Additionally, the Company collects a nominal annual renewal fee from Associates that is deferred on receipt and is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over a twelve-month period.\nCost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials, labor, quality assurance, and overhead costs that are all directly associated with the production and distribution of our products and sales materials, as well as duties and taxes that are associated with the import and export of our\nproducts. As our international sales increase as a percentage of net sales, cost of sales are increasingly affected by additional duties, freight, and other factors, such as changes in currency exchange rates.\nAssociate incentives expense includes all forms of commissions, and other incentives paid to our Associates. Incentives paid to Associates include bonuses earned, rewards from contests and promotions, and base commissions, which makes up the majority of our Associate incentives expense. Bonuses are paid out to Associates based on certain business-related criteria, total base commission earnings, and leadership level. Contests and promotions are offered as an incentive and reward to our Associates and are typically paid out only after an Associate achieves specific criteria. Base commissions are paid out on the sale of products. Associates earn their commissions based on sales volume points that are generated in their sales organization. Sales volume points are assigned to each commissionable product and comprise a certain percent of the product price. Items such as our starter kits and sales tools have no sales volume point value, and commissions are not paid on the sale of these items. Although insignificant to our financial statements, an Associate may earn commissions on sales volume points that are generated from personal purchases that are not considered to be part of their \"Qualifying Sales.\" To be eligible to earn commissions, an Associate must reach a certain level of Qualifying Sales each month, which may include product that they use personally or that they resell to consumers. Associates do not earn commissions on their Qualifying Sales. Commissions paid to Associates on personal purchases are considered a sales discount and are reported as a reduction to our net sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include wages and benefits, depreciation and amortization, rents and utilities, Associate event costs, advertising, professional fees, marketing, and research and development expenses. Wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Significant depreciation and amortization expense is incurred as a result of investments in physical facilities, computer and information technology infrastructure to support our international operations.\nSales to customers outside the United States are transacted in the respective local currencies and are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average currency exchange rates for each monthly accounting period to which they relate. Most of our raw material purchases from suppliers and our product purchases from third-party manufacturers are transacted in U.S. dollars. Consequently, our net sales and earnings are affected by changes in currency exchange rates. In general, our operating results are affected positively by a weakening U.S. dollar and negatively by a strengthening U.S. dollar. In our net sales discussions that follow, we approximate the impact of currency fluctuations on net sales by translating current year net sales at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year periods.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results as a percent of net sales, respectively, for the years indicated:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>82.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>82.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Associate incentives\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>45.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>44.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>68.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>70.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net earnings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant currency net sales, local currency net sales, earnings, EPS and other currency-related financial information (collectively, \"Financial Results\") are non-GAAP financial measures that remove the impact of fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates and help facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations and thus provide investors an additional perspective on trends and underlying business results. Constant currency Financial Results are calculated by translating the current period's Financial Results at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing this amount to the prior-year period's Financial Results.\nSummary of 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales in 2017 increased 4.1%, or $41.2 million, to $1.047 billion, compared with 2016. This increase was driven by higher product sales volume resulting primarily from strong Associate growth in our Asia Pacific region throughout the year. Unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates reduced net sales for the year by an estimated $6.3 million.\nNet earnings decreased 37.5% to $62.5 million in 2017, when compared with 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by a one-time, non-cash charge of $30.1 million, related to U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, and after-tax costs of $7.6 million related to China and our internal investigation.\nFiscal Year 2017 compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nNet Sales\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our net sales by geographic region for the fiscal years ended

increase in net sales in Greater China continues to be driven by growth in Mainland China, where local currency net sales increased 12.2%. The decrease in net sales in Southeast Asia Pacific was driven by decreased sales in the Philippines, where local currency net sales decreased 6.3% and the number of active Customers decreased 8.6%. This decrease was partially offset by growth in several other markets led by Malaysia, and Australia. The increase in net sales in North Asia continues to be driven by growth in South Korea, where local currency net sales increased 26.5% and the number of active Customers increased 19.2%.\nAmericas and Europe: Net Sales in this region were affected by local currency sales declines in each market within the region, including in the United States, where sales decreased $9.4 million or 7.2%, due to a decline of 9.1% in the number of active Customers.\nGross Profit\nThe 80 basis point relative increase in gross profit can be attributed to a favorable shift in currency exchange rates, in markets outside of China, and modest annual price adjustments. With the exception of China, where products are manufactured in-market, changes in currency exchange rates affect the valuation of U.S. manufactured inventory that is transferred to international subsidiaries. Comparatively, gross margins were negatively impacted by currency at the beginning of 2016, resulting in a favorable year-over-year change in 2017. This increase was partially offset by an unfavorable shift in sales mix by market.\nAssociate Incentives\nAssociate incentives were essentially flat as a percentage of net sales from 2016 to 2017. While base commissions on product sales decreased from the prior year, increased spending related to bonuses, contests, promotions, and reward trips offset this decrease.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn absolute terms, our selling general and administrative expense increased $30.9 million in 2017. This increase can be attributed to (i) costs associated with China and our internal investigation into our China operations, (ii) costs associated with continued investment in information technology and infrastructure, (iii) higher wages and benefits expense to support our growing customer base and to\nfurther improve our customers' experience with USANA around the world, and (iv) an impairment charge associated with our note receivable to a former third-party supplier.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes were 53.6% of earnings before income taxes in 2017 compared to 27.8% of earnings before income taxes in 2016. The significant tax increase is due to the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. We recognized an additional $30.1 million in tax expense associated with U.S. tax reform. The 2017 tax rate before U.S. tax reform adjustments would have been 31.2%. The increase compared with 2016 is primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from equity awards and certain non-deductible expenses recorded in 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Securities Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period that may not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the required accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect, as of the end of the accounting period that includes the date of enactment of the Tax Act, only those income tax effects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that the company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete, but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If the company cannot determine a provisional estimate, it must continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax law that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. We were able to determine reasonable estimates for all applicable aspects of the Tax Act. Additional information pertaining to U.S. tax reform can be found in Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share decreased to $2.53 in 2017 from $3.99 in 2016. This decrease was driven, in great part, by the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 and higher costs associated with China and our internal investigation into our China operations. This decrease was partially offset by lower dilutive shares outstanding resulting from exercise activity in 2017 and a shift in equity awards granted during 2017 from stock-settled stock appreciation rights to restricted stock units.\nSummary of 2016 Financial Results\nNet sales in 2016 increased 9.5%, or $87.6 million, to $1.006 billion, compared with 2015. This increase was driven by higher product sales volume resulting primarily from strong Associate growth in our Asia Pacific region throughout the year. Unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates reduced net sales for the year by an estimated $41.6 million.\nNet earnings increased 5.7% to $100.0 million in 2016, when compared with 2015. This increase was driven primarily by higher net sales and a lower effective tax rate largely due to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" Lower gross margins, higher operating expenses, and the negative impact of changes in currency largely offset this increase.\nFiscal Year 2016 compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nThe tables below summarize the number of active customers and year-over-year percentage growth by geographic region as of the dates indicated. These numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand as of the dates indicated. For purposes of this report, we only count as active customers those\nAssociates and Preferred Customers who have purchased from us at any time during the most recent three-month period as of the date indicated.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

increased 24.4% on a local currency basis and the number of active Associates increased 20.1%. This increase was partially offset by a continued year-over-year decline in Hong Kong sales and Associates.\nThe increase in constant currency net sales in Southeast Asia Pacific was driven by double-digit constant currency sales growth in nearly every market led by Australia, Malaysia and New Zealand. Our newest market, Indonesia which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 contributed $5.0 million in sales for the year.\nThe increase in constant currency net sales in North Asia was driven by growth in South Korea, where local currency net sales increased just over 19.1% resulting from a 33.3% increases in the number of active Associates.\nAmericas and Europe: The increase in constant currency net sales in this region was driven primarily by growth in Mexico and Canada, where local currency net sales increased 22.6% and 13.3%, respectively. This growth was reflective in the number of active Associates and Preferred Customers purchasing our products. Net Sales in the United States decreased $9.6 million or 6.9%, due to a decline in the number of active Customers in this market.\nGross Profit\nThe 50 basis point relative decrease in gross profit from was attributed to an unfavorable shift in currency exchange rates, and production inefficiencies associated with moving to our new manufacturing facility in China. This reduction was partially offset by a favorable shift in sales mix by market and by modest product price adjustments that occurred during the first quarter of 2016.\nAssociate Incentives\nThe 60 basis point relative increase in Associate incentives was primarily attributed to higher payout on Associate bonus programs and incentive trip costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn absolute terms, our selling general and administrative expense increased $25.2 million in 2016. This increase was attributed to costs associated with supporting our 2016 strategic initiatives, including (i) higher wages and benefits expense to support our growing customer base and to further improve our customers' experience around the world, (ii) investment in information technology systems and infrastructure, and (iii) increased research and development investment to drive future product and technology innovation.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 27.8% in 2016, compared with 33.6% in 2015. The primary reason for the year-over-year effective tax rate improvement was the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\", which requires excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies resulting from exercise or settlement of share-based payment transactions to be recognized as an income tax benefit or expense in the income statement prospectively.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share in 2016 increased to $3.99 from $3.59 in 2015. This increase was mostly due to a lower effective tax rate, primarily resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 that contributed $0.30 to the year, and a lower number of shares outstanding resulting from activity under our share buyback program. Diluted earnings per share calculations have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one split of the Company's stock effected in November 2016.\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe following tables set forth unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the last eight fiscal quarters, as well as percentages of net sales for certain data for the periods indicated.

result of factors that include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022 The number of Associates and Preferred Customers who join our business, purchase and sell our products, and stay with our business;\n\u2022 The opening of new markets;\n\u2022 The timing of Company-sponsored events, contests, and promotions;\n\u2022 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 New product introductions;\n\u2022 The timing of holidays, which may reduce the amount of time that our Associates spend selling products or introducing USANA to potential Associates or Preferred Customers;\n\u2022 The negative impact of changes in or interpretations of regulations that may limit or restrict our network marketing model or the sale of certain products in some countries;\n\u2022 The adverse effect of a failure by us or an Associate (or allegations of such failure) to comply with applicable governmental regulations;\n\u2022 The integration and operation of new information technology systems;\n\u2022 The inability to introduce new products or the introduction of new products by competitors;\n\u2022 Entry into one or more of our markets by competitors;\n\u2022 Availability of raw materials;\n\u2022 General conditions in the nutritional supplement, personal care, and healthy food industries or the network marketing industry; and\n\u2022 Consumer perceptions of our products and business.\nBecause our products are consumed by consumers or applied to their bodies, we are highly dependent upon consumers' perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products and nutritional supplements in general. As a result, substantial negative publicity, whether founded or unfounded, concerning one or more of our products or of other products that are similar to our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAs a result of these and other factors, quarterly revenues, expenses, and results of operations could vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase revenues in future periods or be able to sustain the level of revenue or rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis that we have sustained in the past. Due to the foregoing factors, future results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If that occurs, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements by using both net cash flow from operations and by drawing on our line of credit. Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow. Although we are required to maintain cash deposits with banks in certain of our markets, there are currently no material restrictions on our ability to transfer and remit funds among our international markets. In Mainland China, however, our compliance with Chinese accounting and tax regulations promulgated by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\"SAFE\") results in transfer and remittance of our profits and dividends from Mainland China to the\nUnited States on a delayed basis. If SAFE or other Chinese regulators introduce new regulations, or change existing regulations which allow foreign investors to remit profits and dividends earned in China to other countries, our ability to remit profits or pay dividends from Mainland China may be limited in the future.\nWe have historically generated positive cash flow due to our strong operating margins. Net cash flow from operating activities totaled $123.8 million in 2017. Items affecting cash flow from operations in 2017 include: (i) net earnings reduced by a change in deferred income tax related to U.S. tax reform, (ii) continued increase in depreciation related to investment in information technology systems, (iii) decrease in inventory levels in the current year, and (iv) receipt of an income tax refund. These items were partially offset by an increase in other liabilities, which was driven primarily by income taxes payable.\nNet cash flow from operating activities totaled $137.0 million in 2016. Items affecting cash flow from operations in 2016: (i) net earnings, and (ii) an increase in other liabilities, which was driven primarily by accrued commissions. These items were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets related to taxes.\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $247.1 million at December 30, 2017, from $175.8 million at December 31, 2016. Of the $247.1 million cash and cash equivalents held at December 30, 2017, $52.2 million was held in the United States and $194.9 million was held by international subsidiaries. Of the $175.8 million held at December 31, 2016, $20.1 million was held in the United States and $155.7 million was held by international subsidiaries. Net working capital increased to $199.0 million at December 30, 2017, from $139.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nHistorically, we extended secured, non-revolving credit to a third-party supplier of our nutrition bars to allow this supplier to modify its facility and acquire the necessary equipment to manufacture our bars. The total contractual unpaid principal balance, including accrued unpaid interest on the note receivable from this supplier as of December 30, 2017 was $6.7 million.\nDuring 2017, we experienced challenges and disagreements with this supplier and subsequently determined to no longer use this supplier. We have evaluated the recoverability of the note receivable from this former supplier, considering financial data of the supplier, and the estimated fair value of the collateralized equipment securing the note as of December 30, 2017. Based on this analysis, we believe it is probable that the note receivable has been impaired. Accordingly, an impairment of $2.7 million was recorded as determined by the difference between the note receivable balance and the estimated fair value of the collateralized equipment as a practical expedient. We will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the note receivable in future periods.\nLine of credit\nInformation with respect to line of credit may be found in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 Part IV of this annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nShare repurchase\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase plan that has been ongoing since the fourth quarter of 2000. The objective of this plan is to return value to our shareholders and offset dilution from our equity incentive plans. Our Board of Directors has periodically approved additional dollar amounts for share repurchases under that plan. Share repurchases are made from time-to-time, in the open market, through block trades or otherwise, and are based on market conditions, the level of our cash balances, general business opportunities, and other factors. In 2017, we repurchased and retired 865,000 shares of common stock for $50.0 million, at a weighted average market price of $57.78 per share. At December 30, 2017, the remaining approved repurchase amount under the plan was $50.0 million. There currently is no expiration date on the remaining approved repurchase amount and no requirement for future share repurchases.\nSummary\nWe believe that current cash balances, future cash provided by operations, and amounts available under our line of credit will be sufficient to cover our operating and capital needs in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future. If we experience an adverse operating environment or unanticipated and unusual capital expenditure requirements, additional financing may be required. No assurance can be given, however, that additional financing, if required, would be available at all or on favorable terms. We might also require or seek additional financing for the purpose of expanding into new markets, growing our existing markets, or for other reasons. Such financing may include the use of additional debt or the sale of additional equity securities. Any financing which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to our existing shareholders.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Contingencies\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 30, 2017 and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:\nPayments Due By Period\n(in thousands)\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Contractual Obligations\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than 1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 - 5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than 5 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>23,614 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>9,883 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,876 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,604 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,251 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>67,828 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>39,498 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>22,422 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,610 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\"Operating Leases\" generally provide that property taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses are our responsibility. Such expenses are not included in the operating lease amounts that are outlined in the table above.\n\"Other Commitments\" generally include consulting- and IT-related services, investments in brand awareness through corporate and athlete sponsorships as discussed under \"Growth Strategy\" within Item 1 of this report, facility maintenance, and services related to the events that we hold for our Associates both locally and internationally. Additionally, throughout the year we will enter into various short-term contracts, mostly for services related to events that we hold for our Associates.\nThe \"Line of Credit\" has a maturity date of April 2021. Although we currently have no balance outstanding on the Line of Credit, fees on the unused portion of this line are due periodically and are reflected in the table above. If we utilize the Line of Credit prior to its maturity, we will be required to pay it in full at maturity.\nInflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"). Our significant accounting policies are described in Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Those estimates and assumptions are derived and are continually evaluated based on our historical experiences, current facts and circumstances, and on changes in the business environment. Actual results, however, may sometimes differ materially from estimates under different conditions. Critical accounting estimates are defined as both those that are material to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require management's most subjective judgments. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are described in this section.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized at the estimated point of delivery of the merchandise, at which point the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer. Revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and payment is reasonably assured.\nIt is not practical for us to track the actual delivery date of each shipment as we ship a high volume of orders through several carriers. Therefore, we use estimates to determine which shipments are delivered and, therefore, recognized as revenue at the end of a period. Our estimates on delivery date largely relate to orders fulfilled in North America and Australia and are based on average shipping transit times, which are calculated using the following factors: (i) the type of shipping carrier (as carriers have different in-transit times); (ii) the delivery destination; and (iii) actual transit time experience, which shows that delivery date is typically one to five business days from the date of shipment. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis based on our actual transit time experience. However, actual shipping times may differ from our estimates. The estimated total of shipments that are not delivered at the end of a period is not material nor would a change in the average shipping transit times (1 to 2 days) have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAdditionally, we require cash or credit card payment prior to shipping and do not extend credit to customers. Payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities. Deferred revenue is recognized at the estimated point of delivery of the merchandise. On the occasion that will-call orders are not picked up by customers, we periodically assess the likelihood that customers will exercise their contractual right to pick up orders and recognize revenue when the likelihood is estimated to be remote.\nInventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a standard costing system which approximates the first-in, first-out method. The components of inventory cost include raw materials, labor, and overhead. Net realizable value is determined using various assumptions with regard to excess or slow-moving inventories, non-conforming inventories, expiration dates, current and future product demand, production planning, and market conditions. A change in any of these variables could affect the valuation of our inventories.\nAccounting for Income Taxes. Income taxes are calculated in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax exposure, together with assessing temporary differences for items treated differently for tax and financial reporting. Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability, and valuation allowances are provided, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized based on our estimate of future taxable income. Should our expectations of taxable income\nchange in future periods, it may be necessary to change the amount of the valuation allowance, which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made.\nJudgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Additional information regarding income taxes, including the potential impact of the recent Tax Act in the United States, is available in Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.", "summary": "The report is a management's discussion and analysis of USANA's financial condition and results of operations, presented in ten sections: Overview, Customers, Presentation, Results of Operations, Quarterly Financial Information, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations and Commercial Contingencies, Inflation, and Critical Accounting Estimates.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of USANA's financial condition and results of operations is presented in ten sections:\n\u2022 Overview\n\u2022 Customers\n\u2022 Presentation\n\u2022 Results of Operations\n\u2022 Quarterly Financial Information\n\u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Contingencies\n\u2022 Inflation\n\u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe develop and manufacture high-quality, science-based nutritional and personal care products that are distributed internationally through a network marketing system, which is a form of direct selling. We have chosen this distribution method as we believe it is more conducive to meeting our vision as a company, which is improving the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world. Our customer base includes two types of customers: \"Associates\" and \"Preferred Customers\" referred to together as \"active Customers.\" Associates share in our company vision by acting as independent distributors of our products in addition to purchasing our products for their personal use. Preferred Customers purchase our products strictly for their personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute the products. As of December 30, 2017, we had approximately 565,000 active Customers worldwide.\nCustomers\nBecause we sell our products exclusively to a customer base of independent active Customers, in order to increase net sales, we must either increase the number of, or the productivity of, our active Customers. Increasing the productivity of our active Customers has not been our primary focus. Rather, we seek to increase the number of active Customers who use our products. We believe this focus is more consistent with our vision of improving the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world. Increases or decreases in product sales are typically the result of variations in the volume of product sold relating to fluctuations in the number of active Customers purchasing our products. The number of active Customers is, therefore, used by management as a key non-financial measure. Sales to Associates account for the majority of our product sales, representing 60% of product sales during 2017, with the remainder of sales for this period to Preferred Customers. We have had a long-standing Preferred Customer program around the world, including in China. Historically, we have reported China Preferred Customers, or CPCs, as Associates due to certain attributes of our CPC program. Beginning with our results for the fourth quarter of 2017, however, we now report CPCs as Preferred Customers. This change in reporting has reduced the percentage of product sales we allocate to Associates for China and overall.\nThe tables below summarize the number of active Associates and Preferred Customers and year-over-year percentage growth by geographic region as of the dates indicated (quarterly). These numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand as of the dates indicated. For purposes of this report, we only count as active those Associates and Preferred Customers who have purchased from us at any time during the most recent three-month period as of the date indicated.\n\n\n(1)We have had a long-standing Preferred Customer program in China but, due to certain attributes of that program, we have historically reported China Preferred Customers as Associates. Beginning with the results for the fourth quarter of 2017, we now report China Preferred Customers as Preferred Customers. For comparability purposes, we have adjusted the Associate and Preferred Customer counts for the Greater China region for each quarter in 2017 in this table to reflect this change in reporting.\nPresentation\nProduct sales along with the shipping and handling fees billed to our customers are recorded as revenue net of applicable sales discounts when the product is delivered, title has transferred, and the risk of loss passes to the customer. Payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities. Also reflected in net sales is a provision for product returns and allowances, which is estimated based on our historical experience. Additionally, the Company collects a nominal annual renewal fee from Associates that is deferred on receipt and is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over a twelve-month period.\nCost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials, labor, quality assurance, and overhead costs that are all directly associated with the production and distribution of our products and sales materials, as well as duties and taxes that are associated with the import and export of our\nproducts. As our international sales increase as a percentage of net sales, cost of sales are increasingly affected by additional duties, freight, and other factors, such as changes in currency exchange rates.\nAssociate incentives expense includes all forms of commissions, and other incentives paid to our Associates. Incentives paid to Associates include bonuses earned, rewards from contests and promotions, and base commissions, which makes up the majority of our Associate incentives expense. Bonuses are paid out to Associates based on certain business-related criteria, total base commission earnings, and leadership level. Contests and promotions are offered as an incentive and reward to our Associates and are typically paid out only after an Associate achieves specific criteria. Base commissions are paid out on the sale of products. Associates earn their commissions based on sales volume points that are generated in their sales organization. Sales volume points are assigned to each commissionable product and comprise a certain percent of the product price. Items such as our starter kits and sales tools have no sales volume point value, and commissions are not paid on the sale of these items. Although insignificant to our financial statements, an Associate may earn commissions on sales volume points that are generated from personal purchases that are not considered to be part of their \"Qualifying Sales.\" To be eligible to earn commissions, an Associate must reach a certain level of Qualifying Sales each month, which may include product that they use personally or that they resell to consumers. Associates do not earn commissions on their Qualifying Sales. Commissions paid to Associates on personal purchases are considered a sales discount and are reported as a reduction to our net sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include wages and benefits, depreciation and amortization, rents and utilities, Associate event costs, advertising, professional fees, marketing, and research and development expenses. Wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Significant depreciation and amortization expense is incurred as a result of investments in physical facilities, computer and information technology infrastructure to support our international operations.\nSales to customers outside the United States are transacted in the respective local currencies and are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average currency exchange rates for each monthly accounting period to which they relate. Most of our raw material purchases from suppliers and our product purchases from third-party manufacturers are transacted in U.S. dollars. Consequently, our net sales and earnings are affected by changes in currency exchange rates. In general, our operating results are affected positively by a weakening U.S. dollar and negatively by a strengthening U.S. dollar. In our net sales discussions that follow, we approximate the impact of currency fluctuations on net sales by translating current year net sales at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year periods.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results as a percent of net sales, respectively, for the years indicated:\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant currency net sales, local currency net sales, earnings, EPS and other currency-related financial information (collectively, \"Financial Results\") are non-GAAP financial measures that remove the impact of fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates and help facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations and thus provide investors an additional perspective on trends and underlying business results. Constant currency Financial Results are calculated by translating the current period's Financial Results at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing this amount to the prior-year period's Financial Results.\nSummary of 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales in 2017 increased 4.1%, or $41.2 million, to $1.047 billion, compared with 2016. This increase was driven by higher product sales volume resulting primarily from strong Associate growth in our Asia Pacific region throughout the year. Unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates reduced net sales for the year by an estimated $6.3 million.\nNet earnings decreased 37.5% to $62.5 million in 2017, when compared with 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by a one-time, non-cash charge of $30.1 million, related to U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, and after-tax costs of $7.6 million related to China and our internal investigation.\nFiscal Year 2017 compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nNet Sales\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our net sales by geographic region for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, and December 30, 2017:\n\nAsia Pacific: The increase in net sales in Greater China continues to be driven by growth in Mainland China, where local currency net sales increased 12.2%. The decrease in net sales in Southeast Asia Pacific was driven by decreased sales in the Philippines, where local currency net sales decreased 6.3% and the number of active Customers decreased 8.6%. This decrease was partially offset by growth in several other markets led by Malaysia, and Australia. The increase in net sales in North Asia continues to be driven by growth in South Korea, where local currency net sales increased 26.5% and the number of active Customers increased 19.2%.\nAmericas and Europe: Net Sales in this region were affected by local currency sales declines in each market within the region, including in the United States, where sales decreased $9.4 million or 7.2%, due to a decline of 9.1% in the number of active Customers.\nGross Profit\nThe 80 basis point relative increase in gross profit can be attributed to a favorable shift in currency exchange rates, in markets outside of China, and modest annual price adjustments. With the exception of China, where products are manufactured in-market, changes in currency exchange rates affect the valuation of U.S. manufactured inventory that is transferred to international subsidiaries. Comparatively, gross margins were negatively impacted by currency at the beginning of 2016, resulting in a favorable year-over-year change in 2017. This increase was partially offset by an unfavorable shift in sales mix by market.\nAssociate Incentives\nAssociate incentives were essentially flat as a percentage of net sales from 2016 to 2017. While base commissions on product sales decreased from the prior year, increased spending related to bonuses, contests, promotions, and reward trips offset this decrease.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn absolute terms, our selling general and administrative expense increased $30.9 million in 2017. This increase can be attributed to (i) costs associated with China and our internal investigation into our China operations, (ii) costs associated with continued investment in information technology and infrastructure, (iii) higher wages and benefits expense to support our growing customer base and to\nfurther improve our customers' experience with USANA around the world, and (iv) an impairment charge associated with our note receivable to a former third-party supplier.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes were 53.6% of earnings before income taxes in 2017 compared to 27.8% of earnings before income taxes in 2016. The significant tax increase is due to the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. We recognized an additional $30.1 million in tax expense associated with U.S. tax reform. The 2017 tax rate before U.S. tax reform adjustments would have been 31.2%. The increase compared with 2016 is primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from equity awards and certain non-deductible expenses recorded in 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Securities Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period that may not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the required accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect, as of the end of the accounting period that includes the date of enactment of the Tax Act, only those income tax effects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that the company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete, but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If the company cannot determine a provisional estimate, it must continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax law that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. We were able to determine reasonable estimates for all applicable aspects of the Tax Act. Additional information pertaining to U.S. tax reform can be found in Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share decreased to $2.53 in 2017 from $3.99 in 2016. This decrease was driven, in great part, by the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 and higher costs associated with China and our internal investigation into our China operations. This decrease was partially offset by lower dilutive shares outstanding resulting from exercise activity in 2017 and a shift in equity awards granted during 2017 from stock-settled stock appreciation rights to restricted stock units.\nSummary of 2016 Financial Results\nNet sales in 2016 increased 9.5%, or $87.6 million, to $1.006 billion, compared with 2015. This increase was driven by higher product sales volume resulting primarily from strong Associate growth in our Asia Pacific region throughout the year. Unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates reduced net sales for the year by an estimated $41.6 million.\nNet earnings increased 5.7% to $100.0 million in 2016, when compared with 2015. This increase was driven primarily by higher net sales and a lower effective tax rate largely due to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" Lower gross margins, higher operating expenses, and the negative impact of changes in currency largely offset this increase.\nFiscal Year 2016 compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nThe tables below summarize the number of active customers and year-over-year percentage growth by geographic region as of the dates indicated. These numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand as of the dates indicated. For purposes of this report, we only count as active customers those\nAssociates and Preferred Customers who have purchased from us at", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of USANA's financial condition and results of operations is presented in ten sections:\n\u2022 Overview\n\u2022 Customers\n\u2022 Presentation\n\u2022 Results of Operations\n\u2022 Quarterly Financial Information\n\u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Contingencies\n\u2022 Inflation\n\u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe develop and manufacture high-quality, science-based nutritional and personal care products that are distributed internationally through a network marketing system, which is a form of direct selling.

Sales to Associates account for the majority of our product sales, representing 60% of product sales during 2017, with the remainder of sales for this period to Preferred Customers. We have had a long-standing Preferred Customer program around the world, including in China. Historically, we have reported China Preferred Customers, or CPCs, as Associates due to certain attributes of our CPC program. Beginning with our results for the fourth quarter of 2017, however, we now report CPCs as Preferred Customers. This change in reporting has reduced the percentage of product sales we allocate to Associates for China and overall.\nThe tables below summarize the number of active Associates and Preferred Customers and year-over-year percentage growth by geographic region as of the dates indicated (quarterly). These numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand as of the dates indicated.

as Associates. Beginning with the results for the fourth quarter of 2017, we now report China Preferred Customers as Preferred Customers. For comparability purposes, we have adjusted the Associate and Preferred Customer counts for the Greater China region for each quarter in 2017 in this table to reflect this change in reporting.\nPresentation\nProduct sales along with the shipping and handling fees billed to our customers are recorded as revenue net of applicable sales discounts when the product is delivered, title has transferred, and the risk of loss passes to the customer. Payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities. Also reflected in net sales is a provision for product returns and allowances, which is estimated based on our historical experience. Additionally, the Company collects a nominal annual renewal fee from Associates that is deferred on receipt and is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over a twelve-month period.\nCost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials, labor, quality assurance, and overhead costs that are all directly associated with the production and distribution of our products and sales materials, as well as duties and taxes that are associated with the import and export of our\nproducts. As our international sales increase as a percentage of net sales, cost of sales are increasingly affected by additional duties, freight, and other factors, such as changes in currency exchange rates.\nAssociate incentives expense includes all forms of commissions, and other incentives paid to our Associates. Incentives paid to Associates include bonuses earned, rewards from contests and promotions, and base commissions, which makes up the majority of our Associate incentives expense. Bonuses are paid out to Associates based on certain business-related criteria, total base commission earnings, and leadership level. Contests and promotions are offered as an incentive and reward to our Associates and are typically paid out only after an Associate achieves specific criteria. Base commissions are paid out on the sale of products. Associates earn their commissions based on sales volume points that are generated in their sales organization. Sales volume points are assigned to each commissionable product and comprise a certain percent of the product price. Items such as our starter kits and sales tools have no sales volume point value, and commissions are not paid on the sale of these items. Although insignificant to our financial statements, an Associate may earn commissions on sales volume points that are generated from personal purchases that are not considered to be part of their \"Qualifying Sales.\" To be eligible to earn commissions, an Associate must reach a certain level of Qualifying Sales each month, which may include product that they use personally or that they resell to consumers. Associates do not earn commissions on their Qualifying Sales. Commissions paid to Associates on personal purchases are considered a sales discount and are reported as a reduction to our net sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include wages and benefits, depreciation and amortization, rents and utilities, Associate event costs, advertising, professional fees, marketing, and research and development expenses. Wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Significant depreciation and amortization expense is incurred as a result of investments in physical facilities, computer and information technology infrastructure to support our international operations.\nSales to customers outside the United States are transacted in the respective local currencies and are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average currency exchange rates for each monthly accounting period to which they relate. Most of our raw material purchases from suppliers and our product purchases from third-party manufacturers are transacted in U.S. dollars. Consequently, our net sales and earnings are affected by changes in currency exchange rates. In general, our operating results are affected positively by a weakening U.S. dollar and negatively by a strengthening U.S. dollar. In our net sales discussions that follow, we approximate the impact of currency fluctuations on net sales by translating current year net sales at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year periods.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results as a percent of net sales, respectively, for the years indicated:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>82.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>82.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Associate incentives\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>45.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>44.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>68.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>70.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net earnings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant currency net sales, local currency net sales, earnings, EPS and other currency-related financial information (collectively, \"Financial Results\") are non-GAAP financial measures that remove the impact of fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates and help facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations and thus provide investors an additional perspective on trends and underlying business results. Constant currency Financial Results are calculated by translating the current period's Financial Results at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing this amount to the prior-year period's Financial Results.\nSummary of 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales in 2017 increased 4.1%, or $41.2 million, to $1.047 billion, compared with 2016. This increase was driven by higher product sales volume resulting primarily from strong Associate growth in our Asia Pacific region throughout the year. Unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates reduced net sales for the year by an estimated $6.3 million.\nNet earnings decreased 37.5% to $62.5 million in 2017, when compared with 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by a one-time, non-cash charge of $30.1 million, related to U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, and after-tax costs of $7.6 million related to China and our internal investigation.\nFiscal Year 2017 compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nNet Sales\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our net sales by geographic region for the fiscal years ended

increase in net sales in Greater China continues to be driven by growth in Mainland China, where local currency net sales increased 12.2%. The decrease in net sales in Southeast Asia Pacific was driven by decreased sales in the Philippines, where local currency net sales decreased 6.3% and the number of active Customers decreased 8.6%. This decrease was partially offset by growth in several other markets led by Malaysia, and Australia. The increase in net sales in North Asia continues to be driven by growth in South Korea, where local currency net sales increased 26.5% and the number of active Customers increased 19.2%.\nAmericas and Europe: Net Sales in this region were affected by local currency sales declines in each market within the region, including in the United States, where sales decreased $9.4 million or 7.2%, due to a decline of 9.1% in the number of active Customers.\nGross Profit\nThe 80 basis point relative increase in gross profit can be attributed to a favorable shift in currency exchange rates, in markets outside of China, and modest annual price adjustments. With the exception of China, where products are manufactured in-market, changes in currency exchange rates affect the valuation of U.S. manufactured inventory that is transferred to international subsidiaries. Comparatively, gross margins were negatively impacted by currency at the beginning of 2016, resulting in a favorable year-over-year change in 2017. This increase was partially offset by an unfavorable shift in sales mix by market.\nAssociate Incentives\nAssociate incentives were essentially flat as a percentage of net sales from 2016 to 2017. While base commissions on product sales decreased from the prior year, increased spending related to bonuses, contests, promotions, and reward trips offset this decrease.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nIn absolute terms, our selling general and administrative expense increased $30.9 million in 2017. This increase can be attributed to (i) costs associated with China and our internal investigation into our China operations, (ii) costs associated with continued investment in information technology and infrastructure, (iii) higher wages and benefits expense to support our growing customer base and to\nfurther improve our customers' experience with USANA around the world, and (iv) an impairment charge associated with our note receivable to a former third-party supplier.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes were 53.6% of earnings before income taxes in 2017 compared to 27.8% of earnings before income taxes in 2016. The significant tax increase is due to the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. We recognized an additional $30.1 million in tax expense associated with U.S. tax reform. The 2017 tax rate before U.S. tax reform adjustments would have been 31.2%. The increase compared with 2016 is primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from equity awards and certain non-deductible expenses recorded in 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Securities Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period that may not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the required accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect, as of the end of the accounting period that includes the date of enactment of the Tax Act, only those income tax effects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that the company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete, but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If the company cannot determine a provisional estimate, it must continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax law that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. We were able to determine reasonable estimates for all applicable aspects of the Tax Act. Additional information pertaining to U.S. tax reform can be found in Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share decreased to $2.53 in 2017 from $3.99 in 2016. This decrease was driven, in great part, by the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 and higher costs associated with China and our internal investigation into our China operations. This decrease was partially offset by lower dilutive shares outstanding resulting from exercise activity in 2017 and a shift in equity awards granted during 2017 from stock-settled stock appreciation rights to restricted stock units.\nSummary of 2016 Financial Results\nNet sales in 2016 increased 9.5%, or $87.6 million, to $1.006 billion, compared with 2015.
