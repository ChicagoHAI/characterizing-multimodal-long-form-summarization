MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBox provides a leading cloud content management platform that enables organizations of all sizes to securely manage their content while allowing easy, secure access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device. With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations. Box provides a single content platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity and protects an organization's most valuable data. Our platform enables a broad set of business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\nAt our founding, we recognized that content is more accessible, secure and powerful when it is centrally stored, managed, and shared. In 2005, we publicly launched our cloud content management platform, which we have architected from the ground up, with a simple but powerful idea: to make it incredibly easy for people to securely manage, share and collaborate on their most important content online. Our cloud content management platform is built to meet the evolving demands of today's distributed and mobile workforce, and for enterprises that are looking to benefit from the increasing digitization of business.\nIn addition, we continue to innovate by expanding our core services and our expanded offerings with a focus on frictionless security and compliance, seamless internal and external collaboration and workflow, and integration with best-of-breed applications. For example, we provide Box Shield, our advanced security offering that helps customers reduce the risk of accidental data leakage and protect their business from insider threats and account compromise; Box KeySafe, a solution that builds on top of Box's strong encryption and security capabilities to give customers greater control over the encryption keys used to secure the file contents that are stored with Box; Box Governance, which gives customers a better way to comply with regulatory policies, satisfy e-discovery requests and effectively manage sensitive business information; Box Relay, which allows our end users to easily build, manage and track their own workflows; Box Platform, which further enables customers and partners to build enterprise apps using the Box Platform; and Box Zones, which gives global customers the ability to store their data locally in certain regions. The increasing success of our add-on products allows our customers to realize the full set of Box capabilities of our cloud content management platform.\nWe offer our solution to our customers as a subscription-based service, with subscription fees based on the requirements of our customers, including the number of users and functionality deployed. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. We recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract.\nOur objective is to build an enduring business that creates sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term. To best achieve this objective, we focus on growing the number of users and paying organizations through direct field sales, direct inside sales, indirect channel sales and through word-of-mouth by individual users, some of whom use our services at no cost. Individual users and organizations can also simply sign up to use our solution on our website. We believe this approach not only helps us build a critical mass of users but also has a viral effect within organizations as more of their employees use our service and encourage their IT professionals to deploy our services to a broader user base.\nOur user base included 70.6 million registered users as of January 31, 2020. We define a registered user as a Box account that has been provisioned a unique user identification number. As of January 31, 2020, 19% of our registered users were paying users who registered as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a paid personal account. As of January 31, 2020, we had over 97,000 paying organizations, and our solution was offered in 24 languages. We define paying organizations as separate and distinct buying entities, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, that have entered into a subscription agreement with us to utilize our services.\nOrganizations typically purchase our solution in the following ways: (i) employees in one or more small groups within the organization may individually purchase our service; (ii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements with deployments for specific, targeted use cases ranging from tens to thousands of user seats; (iii) organizations may purchase IT- sponsored, enterprise-level agreements where the number of user seats sold is intended to accommodate and enable nearly all information workers within the organization in whatever use cases they desire to adopt over the term of the subscription; and (iv) organizations may purchase our Box Platform service to create custom business applications for their internal use and extended ecosystem of customers, suppliers and partners.\nWe intend to continue scaling our organization to meet the increasingly complex needs of our customers. Our sales and customer success teams are organized to efficiently serve organizations ranging from small businesses to the world's largest global organizations. We have invested in our sales and marketing teams to sell our services around the world, as well as in our development efforts to deliver additional features and capabilities of our cloud services to address our customers' evolving needs. We also expect to continue to make investments in both our infrastructure to meet the needs of our growing global user base and our professional services organization (Box Consulting) to address the strategic needs of our customers in more complex deployments and to drive broader adoption across a wide array of use cases. As a result of our continuing investments to scale our business in each of these areas, we do not expect to be profitable for the near future.\nFor the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenue was $696.3 million, $608.4 million, and $506.1 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 14% and 20%, respectively, and our net losses were $144.3 million, $134.6 million, and $155.0 million, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenue from non-U.S. customers represented 25%, 23%, and 22% of our revenue, respectively. Box is headquartered in Redwood City, California and operates offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of a customer relationship. We make significant investments in acquiring new customers and believe that we will be able to achieve a positive return on these investments by retaining customers, cross-selling our add-on products and expanding the size of our deployments within our customer base over time. In connection with the acquisition of new customers, we incur and recognize significant upfront costs. These costs include sales and marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers, such as sales commission expenses, a portion of which are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit, and marketing costs, which are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract. Although our objective is for each customer to be profitable for us over the duration of our relationship, the costs we incur with respect to any customer relationship, whether a new customer or an expansion within an existing customer, may exceed revenue in earlier periods because we recognize those costs faster than we recognize the associated revenue.\nBecause of these dynamics, we experience a range of profitability with our customers depending in large part upon their current stage. We generally incur higher sales and marketing expenses for new customers and existing customers who are still in an expanding stage. For new customers, our associated sales and marketing expenses typically exceed the first year revenue we recognize from those customers. For customers who are expanding their use of Box, we incur various associated marketing expenses as well as sales commission expenses, though we typically recognize higher revenue than sales and marketing expenses. For typical customers who are renewing their Box subscriptions, our associated sales and marketing expenses are significantly less than the revenue we recognize from those customers. These differences are primarily driven by the higher compensation we provide to our sales force for new customers and customer subscription expansions compared to the compensation we provide to our sales force for routine subscription renewals by customers. In addition, our sales and marketing expenses, even after considering deferred incremental compensation we provide to our sales force, are generally higher for acquiring new customers versus expansions or renewals of existing customer subscriptions. We believe that, over time, as our existing customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments, we will experience lower associated sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe use the key metrics below for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these key metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These key metrics also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to certain competitors' operating results. We believe these key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the health of our business.\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842, effective February 1, 2019, and ASC Topic 606, effective February 1, 2018, both utilizing the modified retrospective method. The reported results for fiscal year 2020 reflect the application of ASC Topic 842, and the reported results for fiscal year 2019 onwards reflect the application of ASC 606. The reported results for fiscal years presented prior to adoption are not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC Topic 840 and ASC Topic 605.\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining performance obligations (in millions)*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 767.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 686.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining performance obligations growth rate*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billings (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 745,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 672,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 585,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billings growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow (in thousands)**\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,238\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retention rate (period end)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> Box began disclosing remaining performance obligations upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on February 1, 2018.

We adopted ASU 2016-18, effective February 1, 2018, utilizing the retrospective transition method. For the year ended January 31, 2018, we revised the cash flows from operating activities to reflect the change in presentation of restricted cash. We further revised free cash flow to no longer exclude the use and release of restricted cash to guarantee a significant letter of credit for our Redwood City headquarters. The retrospective adjustments for the year ended January 31, 2018 resulted in a decrease in free cash flow from positive $8.9 million, as initially reported, to positive $7.5 million, as adjusted.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations (RPO) represent, at a point in time, contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. RPO consists of deferred revenue and backlog, offset by contract assets. Backlog is defined as non-cancellable contracts deemed certain to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancellable contract or a significant penalty is due upon cancellation, and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as the delivery of a specific new product or feature, or the achievement of contractual contingencies. While Box believes RPO is a leading indicator of revenue as it represents sales activity not yet recognized in revenue, it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth as it is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, contract renewal timing, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Box monitors RPO to manage the business and evaluate performance. Although we consider RPO to be a significant performance measure, we do not consider it to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated in accordance with GAAP, specifically under ASC Topic 606.\nRPO increased 12% in the year ended January 31, 2020 over the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase in RPO was primarily driven by the addition of new customers, expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.\nBillings\nBillings represent our revenue plus the changes in deferred revenue and contract assets in the period. Billings we record in any particular period primarily reflect subscription renewals and expansion within existing customers plus sales to new customers, and represent amounts invoiced for all of our products and professional services. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. If the customer negotiates to pay the full subscription amount at the beginning of the period, the total subscription amount for the entire term will be reflected in billings. If the customer negotiates to be invoiced annually or more frequently, only the amount billed for such period will be included in billings.\nBillings help investors better understand our sales activity for a particular period, which is not necessarily reflected in our revenue given that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contract term. We consider billings a significant performance measure. We monitor billings to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. We believe that billings offer valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and will help investors better understand the sales volumes and performance of our business. Although we consider billings to be a significant performance measure, we do not consider it to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated using exclusively revenue, deferred revenue, and contract assets, all of which are financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nBillings increased 11% in the year ended January 31, 2020 over the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase in billings was primarily driven by the addition of new customers, expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, and the timing of customer-driven renewals, partially offset by a large customer reducing its use cases in the current period.\nOur use of billings has certain limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Billings are recognized when invoiced, while the related subscription and premier services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Also, other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure.\nOver time, we expect to continue to normalize payment durations. In addition, as we have gained and expect to continue to gain more traction with large enterprise customers, we also anticipate our quarterly billings to increasingly concentrate in the back half of our fiscal year, especially in the fourth quarter.\nA calculation of billings starting with revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented below (in thousands):\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 696,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 608,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 506,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 423,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 375,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 320,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: deferred revenue, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (375,041\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (311,109\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (241,984\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract assets, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: contract assets, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 745,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 672,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 585,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> Balance as of February 1, 2018 upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance lease liabilities (which we previously referred to as capital lease liabilities), capitalized internal-use software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of our core business. We specifically identify adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in our business and strengthening the balance sheet, but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The presentation of free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nFree cash flow decreased $21.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in principal payments of finance lease liabilities of $14.6 million, a decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $10.6 million, and an increase in capitalized internal-use software costs of $5.2 million associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $9.3 million. The primary factors affecting the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities included changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $50.6 million and an increase of our net loss of $9.7 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash charges of $49.7 million. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to the completion of our facilities buildouts in Austin, Tokyo, and London during fiscal year 2019. The increase in principal payments of finance lease liabilities was due to our continued investment in our data center operations.\nRetention Rate\nRetention rate is defined as the net percentage of Total Account Value (TAV) retained from existing customers, including expansion. We calculate our retention rate as of a period end by starting with the TAV from customers with contract value of $5,000 or more as of 12 months prior to such period end (Prior Period TAV) and a subscription term of at least 12 months. We then calculate TAV from these same customers as of the current period end (Current Period TAV). Finally, we divide the Current Period TAV by the Prior Period TAV and report the average of this calculation over the prior twelve months to arrive at our retention rate.\nOur retention rate was 104%, 108% and 110% as of January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The calculation of our retention rate reflects both net user expansion and the loss of customers who do not renew their subscriptions with us, which was below 5% of the Prior Period TAV. Beginning in fiscal year 2021, we will be including all customers in our churn and net retention calculations, both of which will be year-over-year measures. As a result of our focus on driving an efficient land and expand go-to-market strategy, large enterprise customers may begin their deployments with contract values below $5,000 and expand significantly over time. This new methodology will provide a more comprehensive view of how existing customers contribute to our overall revenue growth. We believe our retention rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain and grow revenue from our customer base. Retention rate is an operational metric and there is no comparable GAAP financial measure to which we can reconcile this particular key metric. Our strong retention rates were primarily attributable to strong seat growth in existing customers and strong attach rates of add-on products. As our customers purchase add-on products, we tend to realize significantly higher average contract values and stronger retention rates as compared to customers who only purchase our core product. We believe our go-to-market efforts to deliver a solution selling strategy and our investments in product, Customer Success, and Box Consulting have been a significant factor in our strong customer retention results. Our retention rate is higher in customers who have purchased at least one add-on product. As we penetrate customer accounts, we expect our retention rate to remain above 100% for the foreseeable future.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue primarily from three sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers who have access to our cloud content management platform and other subscription-based services, which all include routine customer support; (2) revenue from customers purchasing our premier services package; and (3) revenue from professional services such as implementing best practice use cases, project management and implementation consulting services.\nTo date, practically all of our revenue has been derived from subscription and premier services. Subscription and premier services revenue are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of seats sold to each customer and the price of our services.\nWe recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the contract term. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. Our subscription and premier services contracts are typically non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging between one month to three years or more.\nProfessional services are generally billed on a fixed price basis, for which revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed. Professional services revenue was not material as a percentage of total revenue for all periods presented.\nRevenue is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing our subscription services to our paying customers, including employee compensation and related expenses for data center operations, customer support and professional services personnel, payments to outside technology service providers, depreciation of servers and equipment, security services and other tools, as well as amortization expense associated with acquired technology and capitalized internally developed software. We allocate overhead such as rent, information technology costs and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each of the operating expense categories set forth below. As part of our hybrid cloud infrastructure strategy, we are in the process of migrating our primary data centers to significantly lower cost regions, which will allow us to optimize our infrastructure efficiency while supporting growth in our paying\ncustomers. We are seeing increased costs during the migration process, but the majority of our duplicative costs are behind us, and we expect to complete this migration in fiscal year 2021. Upon the completion of this migration, we expect our cost of revenue to increase in dollars but trend downwards as a percentage of revenue as we continue to drive efficiencies in our infrastructure to support the growth of our business, our customer base, as well as our international expansion.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, information technology costs and employee benefit costs.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Our research and development efforts are focused on scaling our platform, building an ecosystem of best-of-breed applications and platforms, adding enterprise grade features, functionality and enhancements such as workflow automation, intelligent content management capabilities, and advanced security to enhance the ease of use of our cloud content management services. We capitalize certain qualifying costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage. We expect our research and development expense to increase in dollars but remain stable as a percentage of revenue over time, even as we continue to make significant enhancements to our cloud content management product offerings and services and develop new technologies.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel-related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Marketing programs include but are not limited to advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building, and product marketing. Sales and marketing expense also consists of data center and customer support costs related to providing our cloud-based services to our free users. We market and sell our cloud content management services worldwide through our direct sales organization and through indirect distribution channels such as strategic resellers. We expect our sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as our existing customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments, and as we focus on improving sales productivity from our solution selling strategy and simplifying our product offerings while optimizing the size of our sales and marketing organization to capture strong demand globally.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, information systems, security, compliance, fees for external professional services and cloud based enterprise systems, as well as allocated overhead. External professional services fees are primarily comprised of outside legal, accounting, audit and outsourcing services. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we benefit from even greater operational efficiency.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest expense and interest income. Interest expense consists primarily of interest charges for our line of credit and interest rate swap agreement, interest expense related to finance leases (which we previously referred to as capital leases), unused commitment fees on our line of credit, the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs, and fees on our letters of credit. Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. We have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in overnight deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and short term, investment-grade corporate debt, marketable securities and asset backed securities.\nOther (Loss) Income, Net\nOther (loss) income, net consists primarily of gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and other income and expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States and, as applicable, changes in our deferred taxes and related valuation allowance positions and uncertain tax positions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our revenue. We adopted ASC Topic 842, effective February 1, 2019, and ASC Topic 606, effective February 1, 2018, both utilizing the modified retrospective method. The reported results for fiscal year 2020 reflect the application of ASC 842, and the reported results for fiscal year 2019 onwards reflect the application of ASC 606. The reported results for fiscal years presented prior to adoption are not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC Topic 840 and ASC Topic 605.\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The increase in subscription services was primarily due to the addition of new customers, as the number of paying organizations increased by 5% from January 31, 2019 to January 31, 2020, and strong attach rates of add-on products, which strengthened our price per seat. Also, in this period, we experienced continued renewals from, and expansion within, existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, as reflected in our retention rate of 104% as of January 31, 2020.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 215,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 173,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a net increase of $12.7 million in depreciation primarily related to additional data center equipment and an increase of $12.1 million in rent primarily related to the expansion of data centers and our temporary occupancy of redundant colocation facilities as we are migrating our data center footprint to lower cost regions. In addition, there was an increase of $5.0 million in employee and related costs primarily driven by an increase in headcount from 320 employees as of January 31, 2019 to 364 employees as of January 31, 2020, an increase of $3.6 million in allocated overhead costs attributable mainly to increased facilities and IT software and support service costs, and an increase of $2.7 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by equity grants to existing and new employees. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased two points year-over-year. As part of our hybrid cloud infrastructure strategy, we are in the process of migrating our primary data centers to significantly lower cost regions, which will allow us to optimize infrastructure efficiency while supporting growth in our paying customers. As part of the migration, we have incurred increased overall costs as we pay for duplicative data center footprints, with the majority of costs being incurred as of January 31, 2020. Therefore, we expect our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decrease slightly in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021.\nResearch and Development\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 199,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $12.7 million in employee and related costs primarily driven by an increase in headcount from 409 employees as of January 31, 2019 to 441 employees as of January 31, 2020 and an increase of $17.4 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by equity grants to existing and new employees. The employee and related costs and stock-based compensation expense are net of an increase of $8.3 million in capitalized internally developed software costs associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products. In addition, there was an increase of $5.5 million in allocated costs attributable mainly to increased facilities and IT software and support services costs. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased two points year-over-year. We continue to invest in enhancements of our product and services, develop new products, and further differentiate our offerings.

The increase in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by a $3.6 million decrease in marketing expenses for media and marketing events. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased six points year-over-year due to our focus on driving greater efficiency from our solution selling strategy and simplifying our product offerings.\nOur sales and marketing expenses are generally higher for acquiring new customers than for expansions or renewals of existing customer subscriptions. We expect to continue to invest to capture our large market opportunity globally and capitalize on our competitive position with continued focus on our long-term margin objectives. Over time, as our existing customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments and as we continue to focus on improving sales productivity from our solution selling strategy and simplifying our product offerings, we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 102,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $9.6 million in employee and related costs primarily driven by the increase in headcount from 316 employees as of January 31, 2019 to 361 employees as of January 31, 2020 and an increase of $5.4 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by equity grants to existing and new employees.

rates of add-on products, and the continued renewals from and expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our services. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for contracting activity as a result of buying patterns of large enterprises. Our first quarter revenue is negatively impacted relative to the preceding fourth quarter due to the fewer number of days in the first quarter over which we record subscription and premier service revenue as compared to the preceding fourth quarter.\nQuarterly Costs and Expenses Trends\nTotal costs and expenses generally increased sequentially for all periods presented, primarily due to the addition of personnel in connection with the expansion of our business. Our research and development expenses generally grew over the periods as we continued to invest in enhancements of our products and developed new products. Sales and marketing expenses fluctuated quarter to quarter as we continued to focus on driving greater efficiency from our solution selling strategy and simplifying our product offerings. In addition, we incurred higher sales and marketing expenses in our third quarter due to our annual users' conference. Although general and administrative costs generally increased in recent quarters, the increase was at a slower pace in comparison to our revenue as a result of greater operational efficiency and scale.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to various factors affecting our performance. As noted above, we recognize revenue from subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract. Therefore, changes in our contracting activity in the near term may not be apparent as a change to our reported revenue until future periods. Most of our expenses are recorded as period costs, and thus, factors affecting our cost structure may be reflected in our financial results sooner than changes to our revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> **\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ***\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,296\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,151\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,715\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53,416\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,567\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,830\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> As reported and disclosed under ASC Topic 842 and ASC Topic 606\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> **\n</td> <td> As reported and disclosed under ASC Topic 840 and ASC Topic 606\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> ***\n</td> <td> As reported and disclosed under ASC Topic 840 and ASC Topic 605; adjusted due to the adoption of ASU 2016-18\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of January 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $195.6 million. Our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of overnight cash deposits, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. Despite generating significant operating losses as reflected in our accumulated deficit, we generated positive cash flows from operations as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2020. While we may continue to incur operating losses, we expect to continuously improve overall cash flows from operations through improvements to our working capital management processes to provide capital resources for strategic initiatives to grow our business.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through equity, cash generated from sales and, to a lesser extent, debt financing. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our finance leases and credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, data center expansions, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operation activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOn November 27, 2017, we entered into a secured credit agreement (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the November 2017 Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of November 27, 2020. On November 29, 2017, the restrictions on our certificates of deposit that collateralized the letters of credit were released as the letters of credit were included under the November 2017 Facility sublimit. As such, we released $26.1 million from restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents.\nOn July 12, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the November 2017 Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, among other changes, (i) the maturity date of borrowings under the November 2017 Facility was extended from November 27, 2020 to July 12, 2022; (ii) the revolving commitments were increased from $85.0 million to $100.0 million; (iii) the sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit was increased from $30.0 million to $45.0 million; and (iv) the covenant in the November 2017 Facility that limits the amount of finance leases and debt that we can incur to finance the acquisition, construction or improvement of any equipment or capital assets was increased from $100.0 million to $200.0 million. The proceeds of the revolving loans may be used for general corporate purposes. The revolving loans accrue interest at a prime rate plus a margin of 0.25% or, at our option, a LIBOR rate (based on one, three or six-month interest periods) plus a margin of 1.00%. Interest on the revolving loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to loans based on the prime rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans based on the LIBOR rate (or at each three-month interval if the interest period is longer than three months). Borrowings under the November 2017 Facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The November 2017 Facility requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum liquidity requirement. Additionally, the November 2017 Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting our, and our subsidiaries', ability to, among other things, grant liens, incur debt, pay dividends or distributions on the capital stock, effect certain mergers, make investments, dispose of assets and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of the size and type of the November 2017 Facility.\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended January 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $44.7 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $144.3 million, offset by non-cash charges of $146.0 million for stock-based compensation, $59.4 million for depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and capitalized software, $25.9 million for amortization of deferred commissions, and net cash outflows of $42.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers for the changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $44.0 million increase in deferred commissions primarily due to new and expanded deployments with paying customers during the period, a $35.1 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, a $34.3 million increase in accounts receivable that was primarily due to higher sales and relative timing of our cash collections, a $7.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $5.9 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a $48.8 million increase in deferred revenue that was primarily due to seasonality in our sales cycle which is concentrated in the back half of our fiscal year, predominantly in the last quarter, and a $35.4 million decrease in operating right-of-use assets.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $55.3 million. Our operating cash flows during this period reflects our net loss of $134.6 million, adjusted by a $2.0 million gain from the sale of a strategic equity investment, non-cash charges including $119.3 million for stock-based compensation, $46.3 million for depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and intangible assets, $17.3 million for amortization of deferred commissions, and net cash inflow of $8.4 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $63.9 million increase in deferred revenue that was primarily due to seasonality in our sales cycle concentrated in the back half of our fiscal year, predominantly in the last quarter, partially offset by a $37.6 million increase in deferred commissions primarily due to the adoption of ASC Topic 606 in addition to new and expanded deployments with paying customers during this period, a $12.4 million increase in accounts receivable that was primarily due to higher sales and relative timing of our cash collections, and a $5.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $35.4 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $155.0 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $97.5 million for stock-based compensation, $40.1 million for depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and intangible assets, $21.5 million for amortization of deferred commissions, and net cash inflows of $31.4 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a $78.9 million increase in deferred revenue, a $12.9 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, a $6.9 million increase in accounts payable, and a $3.2 million increase in deferred rent, partially offset by a $42.0 million increase in accounts receivable, a $26.1 million increase in deferred commissions, and a $2.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to the growth in the number of paying customers, strong attach rates of add-on products, renewals and expansion of our existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our services, and an enhanced developer fee from one of our resellers. The increase in accrued expenses, other liabilities, and accounts payable was primarily attributable to timing of invoice payments. The increase in accounts receivable was due to higher sales and the timing of our cash collections between the two periods. The increase in deferred commissions was due to higher sales.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities of $13.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily due to $8.0 million of capitalized internally developed software costs associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products. In addition, included in cash used in investing activities was $5.5 million of fixed asset purchases to support our increased headcount.\nCash used in investing activities of $16.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2019 was primarily due to our investments in Austin, Tokyo, London, and New York facilities for capacity expansions and in our data center infrastructure to support the increasing demands, as well as fixed asset purchases to support our increased headcount. In addition, there was an increase of $2.8 million in capitalized internally developed software costs associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products. These increases in investing activities are partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of a strategic equity investment of $1.9 million.\nCash used in investing activities of $11.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily due to our facilities investments in Austin, London, and Tokyo.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities of $53.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily due to $43.3 million of employee payroll taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock, $38.5 million of principal payments of finance lease liabilities, and $0.9 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with business combinations in fiscal year 2019, partially offset by $23.4 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock under the 2015 ESPP and $6.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash used in financing activities of $29.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2019 was primarily due to $43.8 million of employee payroll taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock units reflecting an increase in equity grants driven by headcount increases and the valuation of our share price and $23.9 million of payments of finance lease obligations, partially offset by $21.9 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock under the 2015 ESPP and $16.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash used in financing activities of $19.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily due to $34.8 million of employee payroll taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock units, $16.1 million of payments of finance lease obligations, and $1 million of acquisition-related contingent consideration, partially offset by $17.5 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock under the 2015 ESPP and $14.5 million of proceeds from exercise of stock options.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2020:\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations, net of sublease income amounts (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 296,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Finance leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 148,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 237,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 258,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes principal, interest, and unused commitment fees on our line of credit under the November 2017 Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Includes operating lease liabilities for certain of our offices and data centers.

In addition to the purchase obligations included in the table above, as of January 31, 2020, we had recognized a total of $10.6 million related to non-cancellable contractual purchases, which were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet. $2.2 million, $3.1 million and $5.3 million is due to be paid in the years ending January 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough January 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from three sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers who have access to our cloud content management platform and other subscription-based services, which all include routine customer support; (2) revenue from customers purchasing our premier services package; and (3) revenue from professional services such as implementing best practice use cases, project management and implementation consulting services.\nRevenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Determination of the transaction price\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Recognition of revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription and Premier Services Revenues\nWe recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the contract term.\nWe typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. Our subscription and premier services contracts generally range from one to three years in length, are typically non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Revenue is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nProfessional Services\nProfessional services are generally billed on a fixed price basis, for which revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts can include multiple performance obligations which may consist of some or all of subscription services, premier services, and professional services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of billings in advance of revenue recognition generated by our subscription services, premier services, and professional services described above.\nDeferred Commissions\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for new contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have estimated to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\nInternal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, qualifying internal and external costs are capitalized until the application is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized qualifying costs are amortized on a straight-line basis when the software is ready for its intended use over an estimated useful life, which is generally three years. Internal-use software costs also include on-premises software, which is amortized over the lesser of five years or the license term. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nLeases\nWe determine whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To determine whether a contract is or contains a lease, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether the customer has both of the following:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the right to direct the use of the identified asset\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize lease liabilities and right-of-use assets at lease commencement. We measure lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term discounted using the rate implicit in the lease when that rate is readily determinable or our incremental borrowing rate. We estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on an analysis of publicly traded debt securities of companies with credit and financial profiles similar to our own and adjust our incremental borrowing rate to reflect the corresponding lease term. We do not include in the lease term options to extend or terminate the lease unless it is reasonably certain that we will exercise any such options. We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all our leases.\nWe measure right-of-use assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for (i) prepayments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs we incur, and (iii) tenant incentives under the lease. We evaluate the recoverability of our right-of-use assets for possible impairment in accordance with our long-lived assets policy. We do not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOperating leases are reflected in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, finance lease liabilities, and finance lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe begin recognizing rent expense when the lessor makes the underlying asset available to us. We recognize rent expense under our operating leases on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we record interest expense on the lease liability in addition to amortizing the right-of-use asset (generally straight-line) over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets calculation. We generally recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to our employees and other service providers, including stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock and purchase rights granted under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan) and 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2015 ESPP), based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards and purchase rights granted under our 2015 Plan and 2015 ESPP. We use the market closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock granted after our initial public offering. We recognize the fair value of stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock as an expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We recognize the fair value of purchase rights granted under our 2015 ESPP as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nOur Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of certain assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions are estimated as follows:\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fair Value of Common Stock. We use the market closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange to determine the fair value of our common stock at each grant date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual lives of the options and 2015 ESPP purchase rights.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Volatility. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, we estimate the expected volatility of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights based on the historical volatility of our Class A common stock over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights, respectively. In previous years, the expected volatility was derived from the historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the same industry that we considered to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights as we did not have sufficient trading history of our Class A common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free rate that we use is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options and 2015 ESPP purchase rights.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock option and ESPP purchase rights.\nFor performance-based restricted stock units that vest based upon continued service and achievement of certain performance conditions established by the board of directors for a predetermined period, the fair value is determined based upon the market closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of the grant; compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied based on the accelerated attribution method.\nIn addition, we have issued performance-based stock options that vest based upon continued service through the vesting term and achievement of certain market conditions established by the board of directors for a predetermined period. We measure stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock options containing market conditions based on the estimated grant date fair value determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model; we recognize compensation expense for such awards over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method.\nWe estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares that are expected to vest. We estimate the expected forfeiture rate at the date of grant based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees and other service providers and revise the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during the years presented.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are typically amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally two to seven years. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charges during the years presented.\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the effect of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements on our financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, and free cash flow (collectively, the non-GAAP financial measures) each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures and our key metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin\nWe define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation (SBC), intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income (loss) divided by revenue. Although SBC is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options, which is an element of our ongoing stock-based compensation expense, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control. For restricted stock unit awards, the amount of stock-based compensation expenses is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Management believes it is useful to exclude SBC in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Management also views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company's developed technology and trade names, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Furthermore, Box excludes the following expenses as they are considered by management to be special items outside of Box's core operating results: (1) fees related to shareholder activism, which include directly applicable third-party advisory and professional service fees, (2) expenses related to certain litigation, and (3) expenses associated with restructuring activities, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs. There are no expenses related to litigation excluded from non-GAAP operating income (loss) in any of the periods presented.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share\nWe define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation, intangible assets amortization and as applicable, other special items. We specifically identify other adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss). These items include expenses related to certain litigation because they are considered by management to be special items outside our core operating results. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares. Similarly, the same adjusting items specified in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) are also excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance lease liabilities, capitalized internally developed software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of our core business. We specifically identify other adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in our business and strengthening the balance sheet; but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented below. The presentation of free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nLimitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures\nA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based compensation expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based compensation expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenue and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position.\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table sets forth our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures for years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages). We adopted ASC Topic 842, effective February 1, 2019, and ASC Topic 606, effective February 1, 2018, both utilizing the modified retrospective method. The reported results for fiscal year 2020 reflect the application of ASC 842, and the reported results for fiscal year 2019 onwards reflect the application of ASC 606. The reported results for fiscal years presented prior to adoption are not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC Topic 840 and ASC Topic 605.\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBox provides a leading cloud content management platform that enables organizations of all sizes to securely manage their content while allowing easy, secure access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device. With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations. Box provides a single content platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity and protects an organization's most valuable data. Our platform enables a broad set of business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\nAt our founding, we recognized that content is more accessible, secure and powerful when it is centrally stored, managed, and shared. In 2005, we publicly launched our cloud content management platform, which we have architected from the ground up, with a simple but powerful idea: to make it incredibly easy for people to securely manage, share and collaborate on their most important content online. Our cloud content management platform is built to meet the evolving demands of today's distributed and mobile workforce, and for enterprises that are looking to benefit from the increasing digitization of business.\nIn addition, we continue to innovate by expanding our core services and our expanded offerings with a focus on frictionless security and compliance, seamless internal and external collaboration and workflow, and integration with best-of-breed applications. For example, we provide Box Shield, our advanced security offering that helps customers reduce the risk of accidental data leakage and protect their business from insider threats and account compromise; Box KeySafe, a solution that builds on top of Box's strong encryption and security capabilities to give customers greater control over the encryption keys used to secure the file contents that are stored with Box; Box Governance, which gives customers a better way to comply with regulatory policies, satisfy e-discovery requests and effectively manage sensitive business information; Box Relay, which allows our end users to easily build, manage and track their own workflows; Box Platform, which further enables customers and partners to build enterprise apps using the Box Platform; and Box Zones, which gives global customers the ability to store their data locally in certain regions. The increasing success of our add-on products allows our customers to realize the full set of Box capabilities of our cloud content management platform.\nWe offer our solution to our customers as a subscription-based service, with subscription fees based on the requirements of our customers, including the number of users and functionality deployed. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. We recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract.\nOur objective is to build an enduring business that creates sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term. To best achieve this objective, we focus on growing the number of users and paying organizations through direct field sales, direct inside sales, indirect channel sales and through word-of-mouth by individual users, some of whom use our services at no cost. Individual users and organizations can also simply sign up to use our solution on our website. We believe this approach not only helps us build a critical mass of users but also has a viral effect within organizations as more of their employees use our service and encourage their IT professionals to deploy our services to a broader user base.\nOur user base included 70.6 million registered users as of January 31, 2020. We define a registered user as a Box account that has been provisioned a unique user identification number. As of January 31, 2020, 19% of our registered users were paying users who registered as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a paid personal account. As of January 31, 2020, we had over 97,000 paying organizations, and our solution was offered in 24 languages. We define paying organizations as separate and distinct buying entities, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, that have entered into a subscription agreement with us to utilize our services.\nOrganizations typically purchase our solution in the following ways: (i) employees in one or more small groups within the organization may individually purchase our service; (ii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements with deployments for specific, targeted use cases ranging from tens to thousands of user seats; (iii) organizations may purchase IT- sponsored, enterprise-level agreements where the number of user seats sold is intended to accommodate and enable nearly all information workers within the organization in whatever use cases they desire to adopt over the term of the subscription; and (iv) organizations may purchase our Box Platform service to create custom business applications for their internal use and extended ecosystem of customers, suppliers and partners.\nWe intend to continue scaling our organization to meet the increasingly complex needs of our customers. Our sales and customer success teams are organized to efficiently serve organizations ranging from small businesses to the world's largest global organizations. We have invested in our sales and marketing teams to sell our services around the world, as well as in our development efforts to deliver additional features and capabilities of our cloud services to address our customers' evolving needs. We also expect to continue to make investments in both our infrastructure to meet the needs of our growing global user base and our professional services organization (Box Consulting) to address the strategic needs of our customers in more complex deployments and to drive broader adoption across a wide array of use cases. As a result of our continuing investments to scale our business in each of these areas, we do not expect to be profitable for the near future.\nFor the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenue was $696.3 million, $608.4 million, and $506.1 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 14% and 20%, respectively, and our net losses were $144.3 million, $134.6 million, and $155.0 million, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenue from non-U.S. customers represented 25%, 23%, and 22% of our revenue, respectively. Box is headquartered in Redwood City, California and operates offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of a customer relationship. We make significant investments in acquiring new customers and believe that we will be able to achieve a positive return on these investments by retaining customers, cross-selling our add-on products and expanding the size of our deployments within our customer base over time. In connection with the acquisition of new customers, we incur and recognize significant upfront costs. These costs include sales and marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers, such as sales commission expenses, a portion of which are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit, and marketing costs, which are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract. Although our objective is for each customer to be profitable for us over the duration of our relationship, the costs we incur with respect to any customer relationship, whether a new customer or an expansion within an existing customer, may exceed revenue in earlier periods because we recognize those costs faster than we recognize the associated revenue.\nBecause of these dynamics, we experience a range of profitability with our customers depending in large part upon their current stage. We generally incur higher sales and marketing expenses for new customers and existing customers who are still in an expanding stage. For new customers, our associated sales and marketing expenses typically exceed the first year revenue we recognize from those customers. For customers who are expanding their use of Box, we incur various associated marketing expenses as well as sales commission expenses, though we typically recognize higher revenue than sales and marketing expenses. For typical customers who are renewing their Box subscriptions, our associated sales and marketing expenses are significantly less than the revenue we recognize from those customers. These differences are primarily driven by the higher compensation we provide to our sales force for new customers and customer subscription expansions compared to the compensation we provide to our sales force for routine subscription renewals by customers. In addition, our sales and marketing expenses, even after considering deferred incremental compensation we provide to our sales force, are generally higher for acquiring new customers versus expansions or renewals of existing customer subscriptions. We believe that, over time, as our existing customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments, we will experience lower associated sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe use the key metrics below for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these key metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These key metrics also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to certain competitors' operating results. We believe these key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the health of our business.\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842, effective February 1, 2019, and ASC Topic 606, effective February 1, 2018, both utilizing the modified retrospective method. The reported results for fiscal year 2020 reflect the application of ASC Topic 842, and the reported results for fiscal year 2019 onwards reflect the application of ASC 606. The reported results for fiscal years presented prior to adoption are not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC Topic 840 and ASC Topic 605.\n\n * Box began disclosing remaining performance obligations upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on February 1, 2018. Year-over-year comparisons against prior periods before February 1, 2018 are not applicable. \n ** In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires entities to show the changes in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-18, effective February 1, 2018, utilizing the retrospective transition method. For the year ended January 31, 2018, we revised the cash flows from operating activities to reflect the change in presentation of restricted cash. We further revised free cash flow to no longer exclude the use and release of restricted cash to guarantee a significant letter of credit for our Redwood City headquarters. The retrospective adjustments for the year ended January 31, 2018 resulted in a decrease in free cash flow from positive $8.9 million, as initially reported, to positive $7.5 million, as adjusted. \nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations (RPO) represent, at a point in time, contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. RPO consists of deferred revenue and backlog, offset by contract assets. Backlog is defined as non-cancellable contracts deemed certain to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancellable contract or a significant penalty is due upon cancellation, and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as the delivery of a specific new product or feature, or the achievement of contractual contingencies. While Box believes RPO is a leading indicator of revenue as it represents sales activity not yet recognized in revenue, it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth as it is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, contract renewal timing, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Box monitors RPO to manage the business and evaluate performance. Although we consider RPO to be a significant performance measure, we do not consider it to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated in accordance with GAAP, specifically under ASC Topic 606.\nRPO increased 12% in the year ended January 31, 2020 over the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase in RPO was primarily driven by the addition of new customers, expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.\nBillings\nBillings represent our revenue plus the changes in deferred revenue and contract assets in the period. Billings we record in any particular period primarily reflect subscription renewals and expansion within existing customers plus sales to new customers, and represent amounts invoiced for all of our products and professional services. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. If the customer negotiates to pay the full subscription amount at the beginning of the period, the total subscription amount for the entire term will be reflected in billings. If the customer negotiates to be invoiced annually or more frequently, only the amount billed for such period will be included in billings.\nBillings help investors better understand our sales activity for a particular period, which is not necessarily reflected in our revenue given that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contract term. We consider billings a significant performance measure. We monitor billings to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. We believe that billings offer valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and will help investors better understand the sales volumes and performance of our business. Although we consider billings to be a significant performance measure, we do not consider it to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated using exclusively revenue, deferred revenue, and contract assets, all of which are financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nBillings increased 11% in the year ended January 31, 2020 over the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase in billings was primarily driven by the addition of new customers, expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, and the timing of customer-driven renewals, partially offset by a large customer reducing its use cases in the current period.\nOur use of billings has certain limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Billings are recognized when invoiced, while the related subscription and premier services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Also, other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure.\nOver time, we expect to continue to normalize payment durations. In addition, as we have gained and expect to continue to gain more traction with large enterprise customers, we also anticipate our quarterly billings to increasingly concentrate in the back half of our fiscal year, especially in the fourth quarter.\nA calculation of billings starting with revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented below (in thousands):\n\n * Balance as of February 1, 2018 upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606 \nFree Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance lease liabilities (which we previously referred to as capital lease liabilities), capitalized internal-use software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of our core business. We specifically identify adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in our business and strengthening the balance sheet, but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The presentation of free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nFree cash flow decreased $21.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in principal payments of finance lease liabilities of $14.6 million, a decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $10.6 million, and an increase in capitalized internal-use software costs of $5.2 million associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $9.3 million. The primary factors affecting the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities included changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $50.6 million and an increase of our net loss of $9.7 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash charges of $49.7 million. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to the completion of our facilities buildouts in Austin, Tokyo, and London during fiscal year 2019. The increase in principal payments of finance lease liabilities was due to our continued investment in our data center operations.\nRetention Rate\nRetention rate is defined as the net percentage of Total Account Value (TAV) retained from existing customers, including expansion. We calculate our retention rate as of a period end by starting with the TAV from customers with contract value of $5,000 or more as of 12 months prior to such period end (Prior Period TAV) and a subscription term of at least 12 months. We then calculate TAV from these same customers as of the current period end (Current Period TAV). Finally, we divide the Current Period TAV by the Prior Period TAV and report the average of this calculation over the prior twelve months to arrive at our retention rate.\nOur retention rate was 104%, 108% and 110% as of January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The calculation of our retention rate reflects both net user expansion and the loss of customers who do not renew their subscriptions with us, which was below 5% of the Prior Period TAV. Beginning in fiscal year 2021, we will be including all customers in our churn and net retention calculations, both of which will be year-over-year measures. As a result of our focus on driving an efficient land and expand go-to-market strategy, large enterprise customers may begin their deployments with contract values below $5,000 and expand significantly over time. This new methodology will provide a more comprehensive view of how existing customers contribute to our overall revenue growth. We believe our retention rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain and grow revenue from our customer base. Retention rate is an operational metric and there is no comparable GAAP financial measure to which we can reconcile this particular key metric. Our strong retention rates were primarily attributable to strong seat growth in existing customers and strong attach rates of add-on products. As our customers purchase add-on products, we tend to realize significantly higher average contract values and stronger retention rates as compared to customers who only purchase our core product. We believe our go-to-market efforts to deliver a solution selling strategy and our investments in product, Customer Success, and Box Consulting have been a significant factor in our strong customer retention results. Our retention rate is higher in customers who have purchased at least one add-on product. As we penetrate customer accounts, we expect our retention rate to remain above 100% for the foreseeable future.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue primarily from three sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers who have access to our cloud content management platform and other subscription-based services, which all include routine customer support; (2) revenue from customers purchasing our premier services package; and (3) revenue from professional services such as implementing best practice use cases, project management and implementation consulting services.\nTo date, practically all of our revenue has been derived from subscription and premier services. Subscription and premier services revenue are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of seats sold to each customer and the price of our services.\nWe recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the contract term. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. Our subscription and premier services contracts are typically non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging between one month to three years or more.\nProfessional services are generally billed on a fixed price basis, for which revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed. Professional services revenue was not material as a percentage of total revenue for all periods presented.\nRevenue is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing our subscription services to our paying customers, including employee compensation and related expenses for data center operations, customer support and professional services personnel, payments to outside technology service providers, depreciation of servers and equipment, security services and other tools, as well as amortization expense associated with acquired technology and capitalized internally developed software. We allocate overhead such as rent, information technology costs and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each of the operating expense categories set forth below. As part of our hybrid cloud infrastructure strategy, we are in the process of migrating our primary data centers to significantly lower cost regions, which will allow us to optimize our infrastructure efficiency while supporting growth in our paying\ncustomers. We are seeing increased costs during the migration process, but the majority of our duplicative costs are behind us, and we expect to complete this migration in fiscal year 2021. Upon the completion of this migration, we expect our cost of revenue to increase in dollars but trend downwards as a percentage of revenue as we continue to drive efficiencies in our infrastructure to support the growth of our business, our customer base, as well as our international expansion.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, information technology costs and employee benefit costs.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Our research and development efforts are focused on scaling our platform, building an ecosystem of best-of-breed applications and platforms, adding enterprise grade features, functionality and enhancements such as workflow automation, intelligent content management capabilities, and advanced security to enhance the ease of use of our cloud content management services. We capitalize certain qualifying costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage. We expect our research and development expense to increase in dollars but remain stable as a percentage of revenue over time, even as we continue to make significant enhancements to our cloud content management product offerings and services and develop new technologies.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel-related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Marketing programs include but are not limited to advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building, and product marketing. Sales and marketing expense also consists of data center and customer support costs related to providing our cloud-based services to our free users. We market and sell our cloud content management services worldwide through our direct sales organization and through indirect distribution channels such as strategic resellers. We expect our sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as our existing customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments, and as we focus on improving sales productivity from our solution selling strategy and simplifying our product offerings while optimizing the size of our sales and marketing organization to capture strong demand globally.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, information systems, security, compliance, fees for external professional services and cloud based enterprise systems, as well as allocated overhead. External professional services fees are primarily comprised of outside legal, accounting, audit and outsourcing services. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we benefit from even greater operational efficiency.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest expense and interest income. Interest expense consists primarily of interest charges for our line of credit and interest rate swap agreement, interest expense related to finance leases (which we previously referred to as capital leases), unused commitment fees on our line of credit, the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs, and fees on our letters of credit. Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. We have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in overnight deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and short term, investment-grade corporate debt, marketable securities and asset backed securities.\nOther (Loss) Income, Net\nOther (loss) income, net consists primarily of gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and other income and expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States and, as applicable, changes in our deferred taxes and related valuation allowance positions and uncertain tax positions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBox provides a leading cloud content management platform that enables organizations of all sizes to securely manage their content while allowing easy, secure access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device. With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations. Box provides a single content platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity and protects an organization's most valuable data. Our platform enables a broad set of business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\nAt our founding, we recognized that content is more accessible, secure and powerful when it is centrally stored, managed, and shared. In 2005, we publicly launched our cloud content management platform, which we have architected from the ground up, with a simple but powerful idea: to make it incredibly easy for people to securely manage, share and collaborate on their most important content online. Our cloud content management platform is built to meet the evolving demands of today's distributed and mobile workforce, and for enterprises that are looking to benefit from the increasing digitization of business.\nIn addition, we continue to innovate by expanding our core services and our expanded offerings with a focus on frictionless security and compliance, seamless internal and external collaboration and workflow, and integration with best-of-breed applications. For example, we provide Box Shield, our advanced security offering that helps customers reduce the risk of accidental data leakage and protect their business from insider threats and account compromise; Box KeySafe, a solution that builds on top of Box's strong encryption and security capabilities to give customers greater control over the encryption keys used to secure the file contents that are stored with Box; Box Governance, which gives customers a better way to comply with regulatory policies, satisfy e-discovery requests and effectively manage sensitive business information; Box Relay, which allows our end users to easily build, manage and track their own workflows; Box Platform, which further enables customers and partners to build enterprise apps using the Box Platform; and Box Zones, which gives global customers the ability to store their data locally in certain regions. The increasing success of our add-on products allows our customers to realize the full set of Box capabilities of our cloud content management platform.\nWe offer our solution to our customers as a subscription-based service, with subscription fees based on the requirements of our customers, including the number of users and functionality deployed. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. We recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract.\nOur objective is to build an enduring business that creates sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term. To best achieve this objective, we focus on growing the number of users and paying organizations through direct field sales, direct inside sales, indirect channel sales and through word-of-mouth by individual users, some of whom use our services at no cost. Individual users and organizations can also simply sign up to use our solution on our website. We believe this approach not only helps us build a critical mass of users but also has a viral effect within organizations as more of their employees use our service and encourage their IT professionals to deploy our services to a broader user base.\nOur user base included 70.6 million registered users as of January 31, 2020. We define a registered user as a Box account that has been provisioned a unique user identification number. As of January 31, 2020, 19% of our registered users were paying users who registered as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a paid personal account. As of January 31, 2020, we had over 97,000 paying organizations, and our solution was offered in 24 languages. We define paying organizations as separate and distinct buying entities, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, that have entered into a subscription agreement with us to utilize our services.\nOrganizations typically purchase our solution in the following ways: (i) employees in one or more small groups within the organization may individually purchase our service; (ii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements with deployments for specific, targeted use cases ranging from tens to thousands of user seats; (iii) organizations may purchase IT- sponsored, enterprise-level agreements where the number of user seats sold is intended to accommodate and enable nearly all information workers within the organization in whatever use cases they desire to adopt over the term of the subscription; and (iv) organizations may purchase our Box Platform service to create custom business applications for their internal use and extended ecosystem of customers, suppliers and partners.\nWe intend to continue scaling our organization to meet the increasingly complex needs of our customers. Our sales and customer success teams are organized to efficiently serve organizations ranging from small businesses to the world's largest global organizations. We have invested in our sales and marketing teams to sell our services around the world, as well as in our development efforts to deliver additional features and capabilities of our cloud services to address our customers' evolving needs. We also expect to continue to make investments in both our infrastructure to meet the needs of our growing global user base and our professional services organization (Box Consulting) to address the strategic needs of our customers in more complex deployments and to drive broader adoption across a wide array of use cases. As a result of our continuing investments to scale our business in each of these areas, we do not expect to be profitable for the near future.\nFor the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenue was $696.3 million, $608.4 million, and $506.1 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 14% and 20%, respectively, and our net losses were $144.3 million, $134.6 million, and $155.0 million, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenue from non-U.S. customers represented 25%, 23%, and 22% of our revenue, respectively. Box is headquartered in Redwood City, California and operates offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of a customer relationship. We make significant investments in acquiring new customers and believe that we will be able to achieve a positive return on these investments by retaining customers, cross-selling our add-on products and expanding the size of our deployments within our customer base over time. In connection with the acquisition of new customers, we incur and recognize significant upfront costs. These costs include sales and marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers, such as sales commission expenses, a portion of which are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit, and marketing costs, which are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract. Although our objective is for each customer to be profitable for us over the duration of our relationship, the costs we incur with respect to any customer relationship, whether a new customer or an expansion within an existing customer, may exceed revenue in earlier periods because we recognize those costs faster than we recognize the associated revenue.\nBecause of these dynamics, we experience a range of profitability with our customers depending in large part upon their current stage. We generally incur higher sales and marketing expenses for new customers and existing customers who are still in an expanding stage. For new customers, our associated sales and marketing expenses typically exceed the first year revenue we recognize from those customers. For customers who are expanding their use of Box, we incur various associated marketing expenses as well as sales commission expenses, though we typically recognize higher revenue than sales and marketing expenses. For typical customers who are renewing their Box subscriptions, our associated sales and marketing expenses are significantly less than the revenue we recognize from those customers. These differences are primarily driven by the higher compensation we provide to our sales force for new customers and customer subscription expansions compared to the compensation we provide to our sales force for routine subscription renewals by customers. In addition, our sales and marketing expenses, even after considering deferred incremental compensation we provide to our sales force, are generally higher for acquiring new customers versus expansions or renewals of existing customer subscriptions. We believe that, over time, as our existing customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments, we will experience lower associated sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe use the key metrics below for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these key metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These key metrics also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to certain competitors' operating results. We believe these key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the health of our business.\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842, effective February 1, 2019, and ASC Topic 606, effective February 1, 2018, both utilizing the modified retrospective method. The reported results for fiscal year 2020 reflect the application of ASC Topic 842, and the reported results for fiscal year 2019 onwards reflect the application of ASC 606. The reported results for fiscal years presented prior to adoption are not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC Topic 840 and ASC Topic 605.\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining performance obligations (in millions)*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 767.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 686.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining performance obligations growth rate*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billings (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 745,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 672,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 585,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billings growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow (in thousands)**\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,238\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retention rate (period end)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Box began disclosing remaining performance obligations upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on February 1, 2018. Year-over-year comparisons against prior periods before February 1, 2018 are not applicable. \n ** In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires entities to show the changes in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-18, effective February 1, 2018, utilizing the retrospective transition method. For the year ended January 31, 2018, we revised the cash flows from operating activities to reflect the change in presentation of restricted cash. We further revised free cash flow to no longer exclude the use and release of restricted cash to guarantee a significant letter of credit for our Redwood City headquarters. The retrospective adjustments for the year ended January 31, 2018 resulted in a decrease in free cash flow from positive $8.9 million, as initially reported, to positive $7.5 million, as adjusted. \nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations (RPO) represent, at a point in time, contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. RPO consists of deferred revenue and backlog, offset by contract assets. Backlog is defined as non-cancellable contracts deemed certain to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancellable contract or a significant penalty is due upon cancellation, and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as the delivery of a specific new product or feature, or the achievement of contractual contingencies. While Box believes RPO is a leading indicator of revenue as it represents sales activity not yet recognized in revenue, it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth as it is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, contract renewal timing, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Box monitors RPO to manage the business and evaluate performance. Although we consider RPO to be a significant performance measure, we do not consider it to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated in accordance with GAAP, specifically under ASC Topic 606.\nRPO increased 12% in the year ended January 31, 2020 over the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase in RPO was primarily driven by the addition of new customers, expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.\nBillings\nBillings represent our revenue plus the changes in deferred revenue and contract assets in the period. Billings we record in any particular period primarily reflect subscription renewals and expansion within existing customers plus sales to new customers, and represent amounts invoiced for all of our products and professional services. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. If the customer negotiates to pay the full subscription amount at the beginning of the period, the total subscription amount for the entire term will be reflected in billings. If the customer negotiates to be invoiced annually or more frequently, only the amount billed for such period will be included in billings.\nBillings help investors better understand our sales activity for a particular period, which is not necessarily reflected in our revenue given that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contract term. We consider billings a significant performance measure. We monitor billings to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. We believe that billings offer valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and will help investors better understand the sales volumes and performance of our business. Although we consider billings to be a significant performance measure, we do not consider it to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated using exclusively revenue, deferred revenue, and contract assets, all of which are financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nBillings increased 11% in the year ended January 31, 2020 over the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase in billings was primarily driven by the addition of new customers, expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, and the timing of customer-driven renewals, partially offset by a large customer reducing its use cases in the current period.\nOur use of billings has certain limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Billings are recognized when invoiced, while the related subscription and premier services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Also, other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure.\nOver time, we expect to continue to normalize payment durations. In addition, as we have gained and expect to continue to gain more traction with large enterprise customers, we also anticipate our quarterly billings to increasingly concentrate in the back half of our fiscal year, especially in the fourth quarter.\nA calculation of billings starting with revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented below (in thousands):\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 696,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 608,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 506,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 423,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 375,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 320,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: deferred revenue, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (375,041\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (311,109\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (241,984\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract assets, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: contract assets, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 745,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 672,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 585,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n * Balance as of February 1, 2018 upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606 \nFree Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance lease liabilities (which we previously referred to as capital lease liabilities), capitalized internal-use software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of our core business. We specifically identify adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in our business and strengthening the balance sheet, but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The presentation of free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nFree cash flow decreased $21.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in principal payments of finance lease liabilities of $14.6 million, a decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $10.6 million, and an increase in capitalized internal-use software costs of $5.2 million associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $9.3 million. The primary factors affecting the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities included changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $50.6 million and an increase of our net loss of $9.7 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash charges of $49.7 million. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to the completion of our facilities buildouts in Austin, Tokyo, and London during fiscal year 2019. The increase in principal payments of finance lease liabilities was due to our continued investment in our data center operations.\nRetention Rate\nRetention rate is defined as the net percentage of Total Account Value (TAV) retained from existing customers, including expansion. We calculate our retention rate as of a period end by starting with the TAV from customers with contract value of $5,000 or more as of 12 months prior to such period end (Prior Period TAV) and a subscription term of at least 12 months. We then calculate TAV from these same customers as of the current period end (Current Period TAV). Finally, we divide the Current Period TAV by the Prior Period TAV and report the average of this calculation over the prior twelve months to arrive at our retention rate.\nOur retention rate was 104%, 108% and 110% as of January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The calculation of our retention rate reflects both net user expansion and the loss of customers who do not renew their subscriptions with us, which was below 5% of the Prior Period TAV. Beginning in fiscal year 2021, we will be including all customers in our churn and net retention calculations, both of which will be year-over-year measures. As a result of our focus on driving an efficient land and expand go-to-market strategy, large enterprise customers may begin their deployments with contract values below $5,000 and expand significantly over time. This new methodology will provide a more comprehensive view of how existing customers contribute to our overall revenue growth. We believe our retention rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain and grow revenue from our customer base. Retention rate is an operational metric and there is no comparable GAAP financial measure to which we can reconcile this particular key metric. Our strong retention rates were primarily attributable to strong seat growth in existing customers and strong attach rates of add-on products. As our customers purchase add-on products, we tend to realize significantly higher average contract values and stronger retention rates as compared to customers who only purchase our core product. We believe our go-to-market efforts to deliver a solution selling strategy and our investments in product, Customer Success, and Box Consulting have been a significant factor in our strong customer retention results. Our retention rate is higher in customers who have purchased at least one add-on product. As we penetrate customer accounts, we expect our retention rate to remain above 100% for the foreseeable future.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue primarily from three sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers who have access to our cloud content management platform and other subscription-based services, which all include routine customer support; (2) revenue from customers purchasing our premier services package; and (3) revenue from professional services such as implementing best practice use cases, project management and implementation consulting services.\nTo date, practically all of our revenue has been derived from subscription and premier services. Subscription and premier services revenue are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of seats sold to each customer and the price of our services.\nWe recognize revenue when, or as we, satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the contract term. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. Our subscription and premier services contracts are typically non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging between one month to three years or more.\nProfessional services are generally billed on a fixed price basis, for which revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed. Professional services revenue was not material as a percentage of total revenue for all periods presented.\nRevenue is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing our subscription services to our paying customers, including employee compensation and related expenses for data center operations, customer support and professional services personnel, payments to outside technology service providers, depreciation of servers and equipment, security services and other tools, as well as amortization expense associated with acquired technology and capitalized internally developed software. We allocate overhead such as rent, information technology costs and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each of the operating expense categories set forth below. As part of our hybrid cloud infrastructure strategy, we are in the process of migrating our primary data centers to significantly lower cost regions, which will allow us to optimize our infrastructure efficiency while supporting growth in our paying\ncustomers. We are seeing increased costs during the migration process, but the majority of our duplicative costs are behind us, and we expect to complete this migration in fiscal year 2021. Upon the completion of this migration, we expect our cost of revenue to increase in dollars but trend downwards as a percentage of revenue as we continue to drive efficiencies in our infrastructure to support the growth of our business, our customer base, as well as our international expansion.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, information technology costs and employee benefit costs.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Our research and development efforts are focused on scaling our platform, building an ecosystem of best-of-breed applications and platforms, adding enterprise grade features, functionality and enhancements such as workflow automation, intelligent content management capabilities, and advanced security to enhance the ease of use of our cloud content management services. We capitalize certain qualifying costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage. We expect our research and development expense to increase in dollars but remain stable as a percentage of revenue over time, even as we continue to make significant enhancements to our cloud content management product offerings and services and develop new technologies.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel-related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Marketing programs include but are not limited to advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building, and product marketing. Sales and marketing expense also consists of data center and customer support costs related to providing our cloud-based services to our free users. We market and sell our cloud content management services worldwide through our direct sales organization and through indirect distribution channels such as strategic resellers. We expect our sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as our existing customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments, and as we focus on improving sales productivity from our solution selling strategy and simplifying our product offerings while optimizing the size of our sales and marketing organization to capture strong demand globally.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, information systems, security, compliance, fees for external professional services and cloud based enterprise systems, as well as allocated overhead. External professional services fees are primarily comprised of outside legal, accounting, audit and outsourcing services. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we benefit from even greater operational efficiency.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest expense and interest income. Interest expense consists primarily of interest charges for our line of credit and interest rate swap agreement, interest expense related to finance leases (which we previously referred to as capital leases), unused commitment fees on our line of credit, the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs, and fees on our letters of credit. Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. We have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in overnight deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and short term, investment-grade corporate debt, marketable securities and asset backed securities.\nOther (Loss) Income, Net\nOther (loss) income, net consists primarily of gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and other income and expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States and, as applicable, changes in our deferred taxes and related valuation allowance positions and uncertain tax positions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of"}
