Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help you understand Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC (the Company\u201d). The Company's MD&A should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, and with Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe own and acquire high quality infrastructure and related equipment that is essential for the transportation of goods and people globally. We target assets that, on a combined basis, generate strong cash flows with potential for earnings growth and asset appreciation. We believe that there are a large number of acquisition opportunities in our markets, and that our Manager's expertise and business and financing relationships, together with our access to capital, will allow us to take advantage of these opportunities. We are externally managed by FIG LLC (the Manager\u201d), an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC ( Fortress\u201d), which has a dedicated team of experienced professionals focused on the acquisition of transportation and infrastructure assets since 2002. As of December 31, 2017, we had total consolidated assets of $2.0 billion and total equity of $1.0 billion.\nAt December 31, 2014, through their investment in the Company, the beneficial owners of the Fortress Worldwide Transportation and Infrastructure General Partnership were Fortress Worldwide Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LP (the Onshore Fund\u201d), with an 89.97% interest and Fortress Worldwide Transportation and Infrastructure Offshore LP (the Offshore Fund\u201d) with a 9.98% interest; in addition, Fortress Worldwide Transportation and Infrastructure Master GP LLP (the Master GP\u201d) held a 0.05% interest. The Master GP is owned by an affiliate of Fortress. The Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund (collectively, the Initial Shareholders\u201d) were investment vehicles which were sponsored by Fortress. The general partner of the Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund was an affiliate of Fortress.\nIn May 2015, the remaining capital commitments of the investors of the Onshore Fund, Offshore Fund and Master GP were called. Through a series of transactions, the Master GP contributed its rights to previously undistributed incentive allocations pursuant to the Partnership Agreement in exchange for the limited partnership interests in the Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund equal to the amount of any such undistributed incentive allocations and 53,502,873 common shares were issued to the Onshore Fund and Offshore Fund based on their relative interests in the Company. In November 2015, the Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund each distributed to their respective limited partners the common shares allocated to their limited partners in accordance with their respective limited partnership agreements.\nOn May 20, 2015, we completed an IPO of 20 million common shares at a price to the public of $17.00 per share. On June 15, 2015, the underwriters exercised their overallotment option, pursuant to which we issued an additional 2.2 million shares to such underwriters at the IPO price.\nWhile our strategy permits us to acquire a broad array of transportation-related assets, we are currently active in five sectors where we believe there are meaningful opportunities to deploy capital to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns: aviation, energy, intermodal transport, rail and ports and terminals.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Commercial air travel and air freight activity have historically been long-term growth sectors and are tied to the underlying demand for passenger and freight movement. We continue to see strong demand for aviation related assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Offshore energy service equipment refers to vessels supporting the extraction, processing and transportation of oil and natural gas from deposits located beneath the sea floor. The recent oil price decline has led to oil and gas companies reducing and deferring spending decisions, creating an oversupply of offshore energy assets, and in turn, lower day-rates, utilization and earnings for offshore service companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The intermodal transport market includes the efficient movement of goods throughout multiple modes of transportation, making it possible to move cargo from a point of origin to a final destination without repeated unpacking and repacking. Over the last year, new container prices have increased substantially, which has led to a rebound in lease rates and residual values from the lows of 2015 and 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rail refers to the railroad industry, which has increased its share of freight ton-miles compared to other forms of freight transportation over the past quarter century. This infrastructure, most of which was originally established over 100 years ago, represents a limited supply of assets and a difficult-to-replicate network. We continue to see increased volumes and efficiencies on our network since our investment in CMQR in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Land-based infrastructure refers to facilities that enable the storage, unloading, loading and movement of crude oil and refined products from producers to end users, such as refineries. Customers of land-based infrastructure typically purchase capacity on a take-or-pay basis, and the economics of these assets directly relate to the volume of throughput.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Segments\nOur operations consist of two primary strategic business units - Infrastructure and Equipment Leasing. Our Infrastructure Business acquires long-lived assets that provide mission-critical services or functions to transportation networks and typically have high barriers to entry. The Company targets or develops operating businesses with strong margins, stable cash flows and upside from earnings growth and asset appreciation driven by increased use and inflation. Our Equipment Leasing Business acquires assets that are designed to carry cargo or people or provide functionality to transportation infrastructure. Transportation equipment assets are typically long-lived, moveable and leased by us on either operating leases or finance leases to companies that provide transportation services. Our leases generally provide for long-term contractual cash flow with high cash-on-cash yields and include structural protections to mitigate credit risk.\nOur reportable segments are comprised of interests in different types of infrastructure and equipment leasing assets. We currently conduct our business through our corporate operating segment and the following six reportable segments: i) Aviation Leasing, ii) Offshore Energy, iii) Shipping Containers, all of which are within Equipment Leasing Business, and iv) Jefferson Terminal, v) Railroad, and vi) Ports and Terminals which together comprise our Infrastructure Business. The Aviation Leasing segment consists of aircraft and aircraft engines held for lease and are typically held long-term. The Offshore Energy segment consists of vessels and equipment that support offshore oil and gas activities and are typically subject to long-term operating leases. The Shipping Containers segment consists of an investment in an unconsolidated entity engaged in the leasing of shipping containers on both an operating lease and finance lease basis. The Jefferson Terminal segment consists of a multi-modal crude and refined products terminal and other related assets which were acquired in 2014. The Railroad segment consists of our Central Maine and Quebec Railway ( CMQR\u201d) short line railroad operations also acquired in 2014. Ports and Terminals consists of Repauno, acquired in 2016, a 1,630 acre deep-water port located along the Delaware River with an underground storage cavern and multiple industrial development opportunities, and Long Ridge, acquired in June 2017, a 1,660 acre multi-modal port located along the Ohio River with rail, dock, and multiple industrial development opportunities. The Corporate operating segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses and management fees.\nThe Company's reportable segments are comprised of investments in different types of transportation infrastructure and equipment. Each segment requires different investment strategies. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies; however, financial information presented by segment includes the impact of intercompany eliminations.\nResults of Operations\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) (Non-GAAP)\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) utilizes Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as the key performance measure. This performance measure provides the CODM with the information necessary to assess operational performance, as well as make resource and allocation decisions.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, adjusted (a) to exclude the impact of provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition and transaction expenses, losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments, asset impairment charges, incentive allocations, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, (b) to include the impact of cash income tax payments, and our pro-rata share of the Adjusted Net Income from unconsolidated entities, and (c) to exclude the impact of the non-controlling share of Adjusted Net Income. We evaluate investment performance for each reportable segment primarily based on Adjusted Net Income. We believe that net income attributable to shareholders, as defined by GAAP, is the most comparable earnings measurement with which to reconcile Adjusted Net Income.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA as a secondary measurement to Adjusted Net Income, which we believe serves as a useful supplement to investors, analysts and management to measure economic performance of deployed revenue generating assets between periods on a consistent basis, and which we believe measures our financial performance and helps identify operational\nfactors that management can impact in the short-term, namely our cost structure and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other entities may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted (a) to exclude the impact of provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition and transaction expenses, losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments, asset impairment charges, incentive allocations, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense, (b) to include the impact of our pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, and (c) to exclude the impact of equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and the non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents our consolidated results of operations and reconciliation of net loss attributable to shareholders to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nTable 120:

(iv) depreciation and amortization expense of $7,144 and $6,564, (v) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $404 and $0, (vi) asset impairment charge of $0 and $3,725, (vii) loss on extinguishment of debt of $0 and $616, and (viii) transaction and acquisition expense of $0 and $156, respectively.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 total revenues increased $68,939 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven mainly by higher revenues in the Aviation, Offshore Energy and Ports and Terminals segments partially offset by lower revenues in the Jefferson Terminal segment.\nIn Equipment Leasing, lease income increased $29,800 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by an increase in assets on lease in the Aviation Leasing segment coupled with vessels on hire in the Offshore Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2017. Maintenance revenue increased by $36,954 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as we increased the number of aircraft and engines subject to leases with maintenance arrangements and the redelivery of two aircraft with end of lease compensation payments totaling $6,338 in the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, other revenues increased $2,484 mainly as a result of crew and insurance reimbursement income in the Offshore Energy segment.\nIn Infrastructure, other revenue increased $3,712 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to activity at Long Ridge, which was acquired in 2017. Rail revenues increased $1,770 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in traffic and expanded service offerings by our Railroad segment. Partially offsetting these increases was lower revenue of $5,673 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 in the Jefferson Terminal segment due to a decrease in loading and unloading due to ongoing construction at the terminal and the conclusion of a long term take or pay contract.\nExpenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total expenses increased $76,222 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in i) depreciation and amortization, ii) operating expenses and iii) interest expense.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $27,900 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to additional assets acquired in the Aviation Leasing segment coupled with assets at Long Ridge and Repauno going into service.\nOperating expenses increased $26,216 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in i) compensation and benefits of $8,896 primarily reflecting an increase in equity-based compensation expense due to the reversal of an expense related to a forfeiture in 2016, ii) facility operations of $5,813 primarily in the Jefferson Terminal and Railroad segments due to increases in volume, iii) operating expenses of $4,149 related to the Offshore Energy segment, iv) professional fees of $4,031 related to an increase in activity and v) cost of sales of $1,977 reflecting the sale of butane in 2017.\nInterest expense increased $19,870 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the Senior Notes and Revolving Line of Credit entered into during 2017.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nTotal other income (expense) increased $26,327 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to higher gain on the sale of assets, net of $12,340, reflecting the sale of available-for-sale securities of an international oil and gas drilling contractor in the Offshore Energy segment. Also contributing to the increase was the asset impairment charge in 2016 of $7,450, where there was no asset impairment charge in 2017 and a decrease in the equity in losses of unconsolidated entities of $4,391.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes increased $1,686 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in net income attributable to the Company's corporate subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxation at regular corporate rates.\nNet Loss\nNet loss attributable to shareholders decreased $20,198 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the changes discussed above.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted Net Income was $10,401, an increase of $19,033 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in revenue, expenses and other expenses noted above, the increase in the period was driven by an increase in (i) equity based compensation of $5,015, (ii) pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Income from unconsolidated entities of $1,304, and (iii) non-controlling share of Adjusted Net income of $2,387. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges of $7,450 and equity in losses of unconsolidated entities of $4,391.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $136,524 for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing $67,496 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in revenue, expenses and other losses noted above, which resulted in a net income attributable to shareholders, the change was primarily due to (i) depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) interest expense, (iii) the pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, (iv) lower equity-based compensation, (v) lower non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA, and (vi) equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities.\nAviation Leasing Segment\nAs of December 31, 2017, in our Aviation Leasing segment, we own and manage 158 aviation assets, including 48 aircraft and 110 commercial jet engines.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 46 of our commercial aircraft and 76 of our jet engines were leased to operators or other third parties. Aviation assets currently off lease are either undergoing repair and/or maintenance, being prepared to go on lease or held in short term storage awaiting a future lease. Our aviation equipment was approximately 86% utilized as of December 31, 2017, based on the equity value of our on-hire leasing equipment as a percentage of the total equity value of our aviation leasing equipment. Our aircraft currently have a weighted average remaining lease term of 32 months, and our engines currently on-lease have an average remaining lease term of 11 months.

respectively.\n(3) Non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of depreciation and lease amortization expense of $537 and $164 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $61,385 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, driven by higher lease income and maintenance revenue partially offset by a decrease in other revenue. Lease income increased $25,079 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 mainly due to an increase in (i) aircraft lease income of $9,382 primarily driven by the addition of 26 aircraft on lease (ii) engine lease income of $15,697 primarily driven by an additional 45 revenue generating engines in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016. Maintenance revenue was $36,954 higher in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the number of aircraft and engines on lease, and the receipt of end-of-lease compensation for two aircraft. Other revenue decreased $648 primarily due to fewer forfeited security deposits included in earnings in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses increased $27,425 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $25,426 driven by additional aircraft and engines owned and on lease in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating expenses increased $1,638 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily the result of increases in professional fee expenses of $902, shipping and storage fees of $565 due to the positioning of our assets for lease, and $171 of other expenses due to growth of the Aviation Leasing segment. Acquisition and transaction expenses increased $361 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting higher deal costs in the Aviation Leasing segment.\nOther Income\nTotal other income increased $853 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, driven by the gain on sale of assets, partially offset by losses incurred by the advanced engine repair JV of $(1,276).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTotal provision for income taxes increased $1,699 in year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in net income attributable to the Company's corporate subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxation at regular corporate rates.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income was $92,637 in the year ended December 31, 2017 increasing $33,869 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by the changes to net income attributable to shareholders noted above, and cash payments for income taxes due to the Company's corporate subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxation at regular corporate rates.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $163,828 for the year ended December 31, 2017 increasing $62,825 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in net income attributable to shareholders noted above, this movement was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense for the additional aircraft and engines owned and on lease, and higher provision for income taxes due to changes noted above in the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by an increase in the non-controlling interest share of Adjusted EBITDA.\nOffshore Energy Segment\nIn our Offshore Energy segment, we own one remotely operated vehicle ( ROV\u201d) support vessel, one construction support vessel and one anchor handling tug supply ( AHTS\u201d) vessel.

2016: (i) depreciation expense of $165 and $245, (ii) interest expense of $82 and $114, and (iii) asset impairment charges of $0 and $3,725, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $7,779 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher lease income and other revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the offshore construction support vessel was on hire with a long-term lease arrangement that terminated in November 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 when the vessel was subject to short-term lease arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the ROV support vessel was on hire with a long-term lease arrangement, as compared to year ended December 31, 2016 when the long-term lease arrangement for the ROV support vessel was terminated in February 2016 resulting in lower lease income from short-term lease arrangements for the remainder of the year. Other revenue increased $3,132 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the crew provisions reimbursement income for the offshore construction support vessel.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses increased $4,758 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in operating expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, operating expenses increased $4,819 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase reflected higher (i) crew costs of $1,919, (ii) legal fees of $1,284, (iii) projects costs of $847, (iv) other operating expenses of $509 and (v) mobilization and costs for spare parts of $260 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, there was $4,781 and $1,646 of depreciation expense related to the construction support vessel and ROV support vessel, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there was $4,776 and $1,635 of depreciation expense related to the construction support vessel and ROV support vessel, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, there was $3,577 and $93 of interest expense primarily related to financing for the construction support vessel and ROV support vessel, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there was $3,634 and $113 of interest expense related to financing for the construction support vessel and ROV support vessel, respectively. The note relating to the ROV support vessel was settled during the third quarter of 2017 due to the transfer of interests from the non-controlling interest holder to the Company.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTotal other income (expense) increased $19,950 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the sale of available-for-sale securities of an international oil and gas drilling contractor resulting in a gain of $11,405. Also contributing to the increase is the transfer of interests from the non-controlling interest holder to the Company as settlement for a note receivable, resulting in a gain of $1,093 in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, there was an asset impairment of $7,450 in the year ended December 31, 2016, and there was no impairment in 2017. In July 2016, the shipbuilder delivered a notice of termination of the ship building contract for MT6015 resulting in the impairment of the investment in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\nAdjusted Net Income was $216 in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $15,404 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the changes to net income attributable to shareholders described above, partially offset by the net impact of the impairment recorded in the second quarter of 2016 for the MT6015 vessel.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $15,455 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to an increase in net income attributable to shareholders of $19,118 as noted above. This was offset by the asset impairment charge recorded during 2016, for the purchase of the MT6015 vessel.\nShipping Containers Segment\nIn our Shipping Containers segment we own, through a joint venture, interests in approximately 34,000 maritime shipping containers and related equipment.

ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) net loss of $189 and $6,161, (ii) interest expense of $785 and $1,323, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of $758 and $2,966, and (iv) asset impairment charges of $0 and $3,068, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues decreased $1,113 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily driven by the sale of 42,000 shipping containers that were subject to direct finance leases during the first quarter of 2016 and lower finance lease income as a result of the amortization of the underlying principal balances.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses decreased $444 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This was driven by a decrease in interest expense of $410, due to the termination of the term loan sale of the shipping containers during the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, the sale of the 42,000 shipping containers resulted in a decrease in operating expense of $34 in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Expense\nTotal other expense decreased $5,666 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in expense was primarily driven by income earned from our shipping container joint venture due to the sale of containers in the portfolios for gains; and no impairment was taken for the year ended December 31, 2017. Partially offsetting the increase in equity income from unconsolidated entities was the gain on sale of direct finance leases of $304 from the sale of 42,000 shipping containers during the first quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\nAdjusted Net Income was $87, an increase of $1,925 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting the changes noted above coupled with a decrease in the pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Loss from unconsolidated entities. These changes were mostly offset by the change in equity of losses of unconsolidated entities, due to the impairment recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1,445 in the year ended December 31, 2017, decreasing $1,228 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily reflects the change in equity in unconsolidated entities coupled with a higher pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities. Also contributing to the decrease was finance lease income for the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by the sale of 42,000 shipping containers during the first quarter of 2016.\nJefferson Terminal

Terminal's pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities includes net loss of $321 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(4) Non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of the following items for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) equity-based compensation of $125 and $(1,581), (ii) provision for income taxes of $16 and $29, (iii) interest expense of $4,886 and $4,914, (iv) loss on extinguishment of debt of $0 and $616, (v) acquisition and transaction expenses of $0 and $156, (vi) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $404 and $0, and (vii) depreciation and amortization expense of $6,320 and $6,050, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues decreased $5,673 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting lower terminal services revenue due to lower throughput and volumes at the Terminal, as a result of increased construction and the conclusion of a long term contract.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses increased $9,687 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflecting higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses of $9,327 reflected higher (i) compensation and benefits expense of $5,333 resulting from the one-time reversal of stock based compensation expense incurred in year ended December 31, 2016, (ii) facility operations expense of $1,779 primarily due to higher volume from heavy crude oil trading, (iii) repairs and maintenance of $1,269, (iv) professional fees of $868, (v) tax expense of $548, (vi) equipment storage of $279, and (vii) insurance expense of $249. The above increases were partially offset by lower environmental expense of $902 related to an oil spill in 2016 and other operating expense of $96. Additionally, the increase in expense reflected higher depreciation expense of $693 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted Net Loss\nAdjusted Net Loss was $27,016 in the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing $5,767 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in net loss attributable to shareholders noted above, the change was driven by the increase in equity-based compensation of $4,369 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, offset by (i) loss on the extinguishment of debt of $1,579, (ii) non-controlling share of Adjusted Net Loss of $1,314, (iii) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $1,022, and (iv) lower acquisition and transaction expenses of $400.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $(8,414) in the year ended December 31, 2017, decreasing $5,234 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in net loss attributable to shareholders noted above, Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by an increase in (i) equity-based compensation of $4,369, (ii) $1,567 in non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA, as well as (iii) depreciation and amortization of $693 and interest expense of $66, mostly offset by decreases in (i) a loss on extinguishment of\ndebt of $1,579, and (ii) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $1,022, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRailroad Segment\nThe following table

2016: (i) equity-based compensation of $44 and $20, (ii) interest expense of $62 and $41, and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of $122 and $105, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $1,770, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to higher traffic and expanded service offerings to customers. The increase primarily reflects increases of $1,465 in freight transportation revenue and $510 in switching and other rail service revenue. Partially offsetting the increase was lower car hire income of $205 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses increased $2,377 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase primarily consists of $1,991 in operating expense, $111 in depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment, and interest expense of $275 related to borrowings under the CMQR Credit Agreement used to finance the operations of the railroad. The aforementioned increase in operating expenses of $1,991 reflects higher (i) general operating expense of $2,099 due to certain tax benefits that were taken in the prior year not available for the year ended December 31, 2017, (ii) compensation and benefits of $614 and (iii) fuel expense of $467. Partially offsetting these increases were lower (i) professional fees of $456, (ii) bad debt of $96 and (iii) other expenses of $637.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income decreased $922 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in net (loss) income attributable to shareholders noted above, Adjusted Net Income was impacted by higher equity-based compensation expense of $351 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2,901 in the year ended December 31, 2017, decreasing $573 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in net (loss) income attributable to shareholders noted above, Adjusted EBITDA was also impacted primarily by higher equity-based compensation expense of $351 and an

acquisition expense of $156 and $0, respectively.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 total revenues increased by $12,152 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven mainly by higher revenues in the Aviation and Railroad segments offset by lower revenues in the Offshore Energy, Shipping Containers and Jefferson Terminal segments.\nIn Equipment Leasing, lease income increased by $4,853 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by an increase in assets on lease in the Aviation Leasing segment. The Offshore Energy segment offset the increase in the lease income as certain vessels were off hire, subject to short term lease arrangements and due to lower lease rates as a result of unfavorable market conditions. Maintenance revenue increased by $11,411 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 as we increased the number of aircraft and engines subject to leases with maintenance arrangements. Our increase in lease income and maintenance revenues were offset by a $6,024 decrease in finance income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by the sale of 42,000 shipping containers during the first quarter of 2016 and lower finance lease income as a result of the amortization of the underlying principal balances. Additionally, other revenues decreased by $1,034 mainly as a result of declining market conditions in the Offshore Energy segment as we continue to seek favorable leases.\nIn Infrastructure, rail revenues increased by $5,287 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in traffic and expanded service offerings by our Railroad segment. The Jefferson Terminal segment had an increase in terminal service revenue of $2,247 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a higher tank lease revenue as a result of new lease contracts. The aforementioned increases were offset by a decrease in lease income of $4,588 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the expiration of the railcar lease arrangement in the second half of 2015.\nExpenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, total expenses increased by $19,027 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 mainly due to increases in general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization, which were offset by a decrease in operating expenses and interest expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $4,746 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 attributable to the higher reimbursements to our Manager, pursuant to new agreements put in place subsequent to our IPO in May of 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $14,902 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to additional assets acquired in the Aviation Leasing segment and assets placed into service in the Jefferson Terminal segment.\nOperating expenses decreased by $2,624 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in (i) stock compensation of $8,311 and (ii) facility operations of $5,211 primarily in the Jefferson Terminal segment due to lower volumes. Offsetting the decrease were higher (i) operating taxes of $1,776 primarily due to additional property, plant and equipment placed into service in the Jefferson Terminal segment, (ii) higher operating expenses of $7,065 primarily in to the Offshore Energy segment since, due to the short term nature of the lease arrangements operating expenses are borne by us, (iii) environmental cleanup costs of $578 in the Jefferson Terminal segment net of insurance reimbursements (iv) professional fees of $673 primarily in Offshore Energy and Aviation, (v) compensation and benefits of $796, and (vi) incurred expenses from our growing business units, including Repauno.\nInterest expense decreased by $354 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by Shipping Containers due to lower principal balances on the term loans, along with the termination of the term loan in conjunction with the sale of the shipping containers during the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was offset by the Dock and Wharf Facility Revenue Bonds, Series 2016 (the Series 2016 Bonds\u201d) issued in March 2016.\nOther Expenses\nTotal other expenses increased by $5,410 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an asset impairment charge of $7,450 as we determined not to proceed with the purchase of the MT6015 Vessel (Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements). Additionally, we recognized a $1,579 loss on extinguishment of debt due to an early repayment of debt in the Jefferson Terminal segment. The aforementioned increases in other expenses were offset by a $964 decrease in losses of unconsolidated entities primarily related to a shipping container joint venture in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a higher asset impairment charge recorded by the shipping container joint venture during 2015. The increases in other expenses were additionally offset by higher gains on sale of aviation equipment and finance leases of $2,522 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet Loss\nNet loss attributable to shareholders increased by $8,238 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven primarily by the changes discussed above.\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income\nAdjusted Net Income decreased by $16,419 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, in addition to the changes in revenue, expenses and other expenses noted above, the decrease in the period was driven by a decrease in (i) equity based compensation of $8,334, (ii) pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Income of $6,457, (iii) losses of unconsolidated entities of $964, and (iv) non-controlling share of Adjusted Net income of $1,612. The decrease was offset by an increase in in asset impairment charges of $7,450 and losses from the extinguishment of debt of $1,579.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $69,028 for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreasing by $3,594 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the changes in revenue, expenses and other losses noted above, which resulted in a net loss attributable to shareholders, the change was primarily due to (i) the pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, (ii) lower equity-based compensation and (iii) lower non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA, and (iv) equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities.\nThe change was offset by depreciation and amortization expense from additional assets acquired and placed into service, and interest expense on borrowings executed in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, there was an increase in the asset impairment changes and losses from the extinguishment of debt.\nAviation Leasing Segment\nAs of December 31, 2016, in our Aviation Leasing segment, we own and manage 92 aviation assets, including 26 aircraft and 66 commercial jet engines.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 24 of our commercial aircraft and 46 of our jet engines were leased to operators or other third parties. Aviation assets currently off lease are either undergoing repair and/or maintenance, being prepared to go on lease or held in short term storage awaiting a future lease. Our aviation equipment was approximately 85% utilized as of December 31, 2016, based on the equity value of our on-hire leasing equipment as a percentage of the total equity value of our aviation leasing equipment. Our aircraft currently have a weighted average remaining lease term of 31 months, and our jet engines currently on-lease have an average remaining lease term of 12 months.

depreciation expense, $4,979 and $6,774 of lease intangible amortization, and $468 and $242 of amortization for lease incentives in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n(2) Non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of depreciation expense of $164 and $21 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues in the Aviation Leasing segment increased by $34,078 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by higher lease income and maintenance revenue offset by a decrease in other revenue. Lease income increased by $23,100 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 mainly due to an increase in (i) aircraft lease income of $18,081 primarily driven by the addition of nine aircraft on lease and (ii) engine lease income of $5,019 primarily driven by an increase in the number of engines which have generated revenue from 32 in the year ended December 31, 2015 to 50 in the year ended December 31, 2016. Maintenance revenue increased by $11,411 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in the number of aircraft and engines on lease. Other revenue decreased by $433 primarily due to greater security deposits included in earnings in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses in the Aviation Leasing segment increased by $14,689 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and an increase in operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $12,820 driven by additional aircraft and engines owned and on lease in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating expenses increased by $1,789 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily the result of increases in professional fee expenses of $812, servicer expense of $376, and shipping and storage fees of $320, due to growth and expansion of the Aviation Leasing segment.\nOther Income\nTotal other income in the Aviation Leasing segment increased by $2,292 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by the gain on sale of assets.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income in the Aviation Leasing segment was $58,768 in the year ended December 31, 2016 increasing by $20,991 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by the changes to net income attributable to shareholders noted above, adjusted for the provision for income taxes and cash payments for income taxes.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA in the Aviation Leasing segment was $101,003 for the year ended December 31, 2016 increasing by $32,455 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the changes in net income attributable to shareholders noted above, this movement was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense for the additional aircraft and engines owned and on lease in the year ended December 31, 2016, offset by a decrease in the provision for income tax and an increase in the non-controlling interest share of Adjusted EBITDA.\nOffshore Energy Segment\nIn our Offshore Energy segment, we own one remotely operated vehicle ( ROV\u201d) support vessel, one construction support vessel and one anchor handling tug supply ( AHTS\u201d) vessel.

2015: (i) depreciation expense of $245 and $225, (ii) interest expense of $114 and $120, and (iii) asset impairment charges of $3,725 and $0, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues in the Offshore Energy segment decreased by $18,903 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by lower lease income. In 2016, the offshore construction support vessel was subject to short term lease arrangements, as compared to 2015 when the vessel was on hire under a long term arrangement that terminated in the second half of 2015. In February 2016, the long term lease arrangement for the ROV support vessel was terminated resulting in lower lease income from short term lease arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses in the Offshore Energy segment increased by $6,761 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Total expenses for the offshore construction support vessel included interest expense on term loan financing, depreciation and amortization expense, and operating expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, there was $4,776 and $1,635 of depreciation expense related to the construction support vessel and ROV support vessel, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, there was $4,468 and $1,499 of depreciation expense related to the construction support vessel and ROV support vessel, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, there was $3,634 and $113 of interest expense primarily related to financing for the construction support vessel and ROV support vessel, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, there was $3,674 and $120 of interest expense related to financing for the construction support vessel and ROV support vessel, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, operating expenses increased $6,364 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Historically, operating expenses were incurred by the bareboat charterers when the ROV support vessel and the offshore construction support vessel were on lease. In 2016, due to the short term nature of the lease arrangements, operating expenses were borne by us. The increase in operating expenses was the result of increased (i) crew costs of $2,308, (ii) legal fees of $1,863, (iii) mobilization and costs for spare parts of $1,216, (iv) management fees of $237 and (v) other operating expenses of $740 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther (Expense) Income\nTotal other income in the Offshore Energy segment decreased by $7,920 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an asset impairment charge of $7,450. In July 2016, the shipbuilder delivered a notice of termination of the ship building contract for MT6015 resulting in the impairment of the investment in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income\nAdjusted Net Loss was $15,188 in the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $24,815 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This loss was due to the changes described above offset by the asset impairment charge of $7,450, which is added back in the determination of Adjusted Net Loss, less the portion shared with our non-controlling interest holder, in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $24,432 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a decrease in net income attributable to shareholders of $28,540 as noted above. This was offset by the asset impairment charge of $7,450, which was shared with the non-controlling interest holder in the year ended December 31, 2016, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $444 related to the offshore construction vessel in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nShipping Containers Segment\nIn our Shipping Containers segment, we own, through a joint venture, interests in approximately 76,000 maritime shipping containers and related equipment through one portfolio.

for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: (i) net income (loss) of $(6,161) and $(7,165), (ii) interest expense of $1,323 and $1,778, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of $2,966 and $1,866, and (iv) asset impairment charges of $3,068 and $10,508, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues in the Shipping Containers segment decreased by $5,969 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily driven by the sale of 42,000 shipping containers that were subject to direct finance leases during the first quarter of 2016 and lower finance lease income as a result of the amortization of the underlying principal balances.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses in the Shipping Containers segment decreased by $2,290 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This was driven by a decrease in interest expense of $1,983 in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to lower principal balances on the term loans, along with the termination of the term loan in conjunction with the sale of the shipping containers. Additionally, the sale of the 42,000 shipping containers resulted in a decrease in operating expense of $307 in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Expense\nTotal other expense in the Shipping Containers segment decreased $1,300 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease in losses of unconsolidated entities from our shipping container joint venture of $982 in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a larger impairment recognized by the shipping container joint venture in September 2015 as compared to the impairment charge recognized in December 2016. The change in other expenses was also impacted by a gain on sale of direct finance leases of $304 from the sale of 42,000 shipping containers during the first quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income\nAdjusted Net Income decreased by $9,829 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to decrease in finance lease income driven by the sale of 42,000 shipping containers during the first quarter of 2016 and lower pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Loss from unconsolidated entities due to the impairment recognized by the shipping container joint venture in September 2015 as compared to December 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2,673 in the year ended December 31, 2016, decreasing by $11,146 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the decrease in finance lease income driven by the sale of 42,000 shipping containers during the first quarter of 2016 and lower pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities due to the impairment recognized by the shipping container joint venture in September 2015 as compared to December 2016.\nJefferson Terminal Segment\nThe following table presents our results of operations and reconciliation of net loss attributable to shareholders to Adjusted Net Loss for the Jefferson Terminal

for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: (i) equity-based compensation of $(1,581) and $1,339, (ii) provision for income taxes of $29 and $16, (iii) interest expense of $4,914 and $4,783, (iv) loss on extinguishment of debt of $616 and $0, (v) acquisition and transaction expenses of $156 and $0, and (vi) depreciation and amortization expense of $6,050 and $5,424, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues in the Jefferson Terminal segment decreased by $2,373 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lease income of $4,620 as rail cars were off-lease during the year ended December 31, 2016. Terminal services revenue increased by $2,247 in the year ended December 31, 2016, due to higher tank lease revenue of $2,709 as a result of new lease contracts, offset by decreases in unloading revenues due to lower volumes.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses in the Jefferson Terminal segment decreased by $8,310 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease consists of lower operating expenses of $11,268, including lower equity-based compensation expense of $7,483, a decrease of $4,349 in facility operations expense primarily due to lower volume, $1,242 in professional fees and $163 in lease expense. The above decreases were offset by an increase in property tax expense of $1,205 due to additional property, plant and equipment placed into service during the year and maintenance expense of $1,165 due to repair on certain assets. The decrease in operating expenses was offset by an increase of $400 in acquisition and transaction costs, $1,603 of depreciation expense due to property, plant and equipment placed into service and $955 of interest expense driven by the 2016 bonds issued in March 2016.\nAdjusted Net Loss\nAdjusted Net Loss was $21,249 in the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased by $904 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the changes in net loss attributable to shareholders noted above, the change was driven by the decrease in equity-based compensation of $7,483 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, offset by acquisition and transaction expenses incurred related to the creation of a joint venture during 2016, and a loss on extinguishment of debt.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $(3,180) in the year ended December 31, 2016, increasing $2,527 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the changes in net loss attributable to shareholders noted above, Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by a decrease in equity-based compensation of $7,483, offset by the increase in a loss on extinguishment of debt, depreciation and amortization, and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRailroad Segment\nThe following table

In addition to the changes in net loss attributable to shareholders noted above, Adjusted Net Loss was adjusted by acquisition and transaction expenses, incurred for potential acquisition opportunities, which were higher for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $(30,060) in the year ended December 31, 2016, decreasing $(7,503) compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the changes in net loss attributable to shareholders noted above, Adjusted EBITDA was affected by acquisition and transaction expenses, incurred for potential acquisition opportunities, which were higher for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to year ended December 31, 2015.\nTransactions with Affiliates and Affiliated Entities\nWe are managed by FIG LLC (the Manager\u201d), an affiliate of Fortress, pursuant to a management agreement (the Management Agreement\u201d) which provides for us to bear obligations for management fees and expense reimbursements payable to the Manager. Our Management Agreement requires our Manager to manage our business affairs in conformity with a broad asset acquisition strategy adopted and monitored by our board of directors. From time to time, we may engage (subject to our strategy) in material transactions with our Manager or another entity managed by our Manager or one of its affiliates or other affiliates of Fortress, which may include, but are not limited to, certain financing arrangements, acquisition of assets, acquisition of debt obligations, debt, co-investments, and other assets that present an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest. Please see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing for more information.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 10, 2018, the Company agreed to sell 7,000,000 common shares, par value $0.01 per share, representing limited liability interest in the Company, in connection with a public offering, at a price of $18.65 per share. The offering closed on January 16, 2018. Net proceeds received by the Company from the offering were approximately $128 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. To compensate the Manager for its successful efforts in raising capital for the Company, in connection with the offering, the Company granted options to the Manager related to 700,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the public offering price which had a fair value of approximately $1.9 million as of the grant date. The assumptions used in valuing the options were: a 2.52% risk-free rate, a 5.45% dividend yield, a 27.73% volatility and a ten-year term. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the funding of future investments.\nOn February 27, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on its common shares of $0.33 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, payable on March 27, 2018 to the holders of record on March 16, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal uses of liquidity have been and continue to be (i) acquisitions of transportation infrastructure and equipment, (ii) distributions to our shareholders, (iii) expenses associated with our operating activities and (iv) debt service obligations associated with our investments (all dollar amounts are expressed in thousands).\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, cash used for the purpose of making investments was $594,558, $308,069, and $278,433, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, distributions to shareholders, including cash dividends, were $100,058, $100,027 and $81,260 respectively, and distributions to non-controlling interest were $254, $0, and $321 respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Uses of liquidity associated with our operating expenses are captured on a net basis in our cash flows from operating activities.

Net loss was $23,240 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared $40,598 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase in net income of $17,358. The increase was also attributable to adjustments to reconcile net income which include an increase of $27,900 relating to depreciation and amortization, $5,015 relating to equity based compensation, and $2,859 of amortization of lease intangibles and incentives, partially offset by asset impairment of $7,450 in 2016 and a change in gain on sale of equipment of $12,340 as compared to 2016. Also contributing to the offset were the changes in accounts receivable, other assets, and other liabilities due to the continued expansion of operations across all business segments.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $440,230 and $213,098 in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing a $227,132 increase. Cash used in investing activities increased due to the acquisition of leasing equipment and lease intangibles of $230,751 in the Aviation Leasing segment, cash used for investments of $1,526, and the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $58,660 mainly due to the acquisition of Long Ridge. Partially offsetting this increase were higher proceeds from the sale of leasing equipment and available-for-sale securities of $68,245 and $30,238, respectively, and a change in restricted cash of $34,385 at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. Additionally, cash used in investing activities increased due to less cash received from the sale of two finance leases of $71,000 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $363,078 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to cash used in financing activities of $131,453 in year ended December 31, 2016, representing a $494,531 increase. The increase was primarily attributable to proceeds from borrowings under i) the Term Loan of $97,163, net of deferred financing costs, ii) the Revolving Credit Facility of $95,000, iii) the CMQR Credit Agreement of $32,030 and iv) the Senior Notes of $342,998, net of deferred financing costs and repayment of the Term Loan. Also contributing to the increase was a decrease in the repayment of debt related to the termination of the Jefferson Terminal Credit Agreement and loans associated with the sale of shipping containers in the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as an increase in receipt of maintenance deposits of $12,245, offset by a decrease in cash contributions from non-controlling interests of $11,445.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $30,903 in the years ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $23,528 in the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a $7,375 increase. Net loss was $40,598 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared $28,631 for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $11,967. The decrease was offset by non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income which include an increase of (i) $7,450 relating to an asset impairment, (ii) $14,902 relating to depreciation and amortization, and (iii) $1,579 loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by a decrease in equity based compensation of $8,334, equity in losses from unconsolidated entities of $964 and gain on sale of equipment of $2,522 as compared to 2015. The decrease was further offset by the changes in in accounts payable, other liabilities, accounts receivable and other assets due to the continued expansion of operations across all business segments,\nNet cash used in investing activities was $213,098 and $239,921 in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a $26,823 decrease. Cash used in investing activities decreased due to cash received for the sale of two finance leases, resulting in proceeds of $71,000, a decrease in cash paid for property, plant and equipment of $38,657, and the investment in the note receivable of $11,803 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in cash used for the acquisition of leasing equipment of $35,550, cash used for purchase deposits of aircraft and aircraft engines of $13,681, and investments of $28,784, as well as a decrease principal collections on finance leases of $17,779 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $131,453 in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $575,971 in year ended December 31, 2015, representing a $707,424 decrease. Such decrease was attributable to (i) a decrease in cash proceeds received due to the issuance of common shares net of issuance costs paid of $351,059, (ii) a decrease in capital contributions from shareholders of $295,879, and (iii) a decrease in capital contributions from non-controlling interests of $26,346. In addition to these decreases, cash outflows increased in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to repayment of debt, net of proceeds from borrowings of $25,947, cash dividends paid of $63,684, offset by a decrease in distributions to shareholders of $44,917 and a net increase in maintenance deposits of $13,164.\nFunds Available for Distribution (Non-GAAP)\nThe Company uses Funds Available for Distribution ( FAD\u201d) in evaluating its ability to meet its stated dividend policy. FAD is not a financial measure in accordance with GAAP. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FAD is net cash provided by operating activities. The Company believes FAD is a useful metric for investors and analysts for similar purposes.\nThe Company defines FAD as: net cash provided by operating activities plus principal collections on finance leases, proceeds from sale of assets, and return of capital distributions from unconsolidated entities, less required payments on debt obligations and capital distributions to non-controlling interest, and excluding changes in working capital. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to FAD:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Principal Collections on Finance Leases\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Proceeds from Sale of Assets (1)\n</td> <td>121,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Return of Capital Distributions from Unconsolidated Entities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Required Payments on Debt Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>(8,368\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(53,668\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,761\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Capital Distributions to Non-Controlling Interest\n</td> <td>(254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(321\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exclude: Changes in Working Capital\n</td> <td>(4,515\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds Available for Distribution (FAD)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________________________________\n(1) Proceeds from sale of assets includes $500 received in December 2015 for a deposit on the sale of a commercial jet engine, which was completed in the year ended December 31, 2016.\n(2) Required payments on debt obligations for the year ended December 31, 2017 excludes $100,000 repayment of the Term Loan, $95,000 repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and $21,855 repayment of the CMQR Credit Agreement, and for the year ended December 31, 2016 excludes $98,750 repayment upon the termination of the Jefferson Terminal Credit Agreement and $7,748 repayment under the CMQR Credit Agreement which were voluntary refinancing as repayment of these amounts were not required at this time.\nLimitations\nFAD is subject to a number of limitations and assumptions and there can be no assurance that the Company will generate FAD sufficient to meet its intended dividends. FAD has material limitations as a liquidity measure of the Company because such measure excludes items that are required elements of the Company's net cash provided by operating activities as described below. FAD should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results of operations under GAAP, and it is not the only metric that should be considered in evaluating the Company's ability to meet its stated dividend policy. Specifically:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>FAD does not include equity capital called from the Company's existing limited partners, proceeds from any debt issuance or future equity offering, historical cash and cash equivalents and expected investments in the Company's operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>FAD does not give pro forma effect to prior acquisitions, certain of which cannot be quantified.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>While FAD reflects the cash inflows from sale of certain assets, FAD does not reflect the cash outflows to acquire assets as the Company relies on alternative sources of liquidity to fund such purchases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>FAD does not reflect expenditures related to capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments as the Company has multiple sources of liquidity and intends to fund these expenditures with future incurrences of indebtedness, additional capital contributions and/or future issuances of equity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>FAD does not reflect any maintenance capital expenditures necessary to maintain the same level of cash generation from our capital investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>FAD does not reflect changes in working capital balances as management believes that changes in working capital are primarily driven by short term timing differences, which are not meaningful to the Company's distribution decisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Management has significant discretion to make distributions, and the Company is not bound by any contractual provision that requires it to use cash for distributions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf such factors were included in FAD, there can be no assurance that the results would be consistent with the Company's presentation of FAD.\nDebt Obligations\nFTAI Pride Credit Agreement-On September 15, 2014, FTAI Pride, LLC, ( FTAI Pride\u201d) a subsidiary of the Company entered into a credit agreement (the FTAI Pride Credit Agreement\u201d) with a financial institution for a term loan in an aggregate amount of $75,000. The loan proceeds were used in connection with the acquisition of an offshore construction vessel. The FTAI Pride Credit Agreement requires quarterly payments of interest and scheduled principal payments of $1,562 beginning in the quarter ending December 31, 2015, through its maturity on September 15, 2019, and can be prepaid without penalty at any time. The FTAI Pride Credit Agreement is secured on a first priority basis by the offshore construction vessel and charter. Borrowings under the FTAI Pride Credit Agreement bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus a spread of 4.50%.\nThe FTAI Pride Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants which limit certain actions of the borrower and a financial covenant requiring the borrower to maintain a Fixed Charges Coverage Ratio, as defined, of not less than 1.15:1.00 in any twelve month period ending December 31, 2014, or later.\nCMQR Credit Agreement-On June 30, 2017, CMQR amended its credit agreement (the CMQR Credit Agreement\u201d) with a financial institution for a revolving credit to increase the aggregate amount from $20,000 to $25,000 and to extend the maturity date to September 18, 2019. Borrowings under the CMQR Credit Agreement bear interest at either (i) Adjusted LIBOR plus a spread of 2.50% of 4.50%, (ii) the U.S. or Canadian Base Rate plus a spread of 1.50% to 3.50%, or (iii) the Canadian Fixed Rate plus a spread of 2.50% or 4.50%, as defined by the CMQR Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 3.95% and 3.21%, respectively.\nThe CMQR Credit Agreement is also indirectly supported by Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC (the Sponsor\u201d). In the event of a default under the credit agreement, CMQR's lenders can cause CMQR to call up to a total of $29 million in capital from the Sponsor, and in the event of CMQR's bankruptcy, the lenders can put the debt back to the Sponsor. The CMQR Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants which limit certain actions of CMQR.\nSeries 2012 Bonds-On August 1, 2012, Jefferson County Development Corporation issued $46,875 of tax-exempt industrial bonds ( Series 2012 Bonds\u201d), to specifically fund construction and operation of an intermodal transfer facility for crude oil and refined petroleum products. The proceeds of this issuance were loaned to Jefferson Terminal, to be held in trust, as restricted cash, to ensure adherence to the restrictions of use of the funds. Use of the proceeds requires approval from a trustee prior to release of funds. Such restricted cash may only be released to us after payment of applicable reserves, including a six-month interest reserve, and expenses, as determined by the trustee. The Series 2012 Bonds have a stated maturity of July 1, 2032, bear interest at 8.25%, and require scheduled principal payments. The principal of the Series 2012 Bonds is payable annually at varying amounts.\nIn connection with the Company's acquisition of Jefferson Terminal, the Series 2012 Bonds were recorded at a fair value of $48,554, which represented a premium of $1,823 as compared to their face value at the date of acquisition; such premium is being amortized using the effective interest method over the remaining contractual term of the Series 2012 Bonds.\nThe Series 2012 Bond agreement contains a financial covenant requiring a subsidiary of the Company to maintain a long-term debt service coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, of 1.25 to 1, in each fiscal year, beginning with December 31, 2014.\nSeries 2016 Bonds-On March 7, 2016, the Port of Beaumont Navigation District of Jefferson County, Texas (the District\u201d) issued $144,200 of Dock and Wharf Facility Revenue Bonds, Series 2016 (Jefferson Energy Companies Project) (the Series 2016 Bonds\u201d). Proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2016 Bonds were used, in part, to reimburse Jefferson Railport Terminal II, LLC ( Jefferson Railport II\u201d) for certain costs related to the development, construction and acquisition of certain facilities for the transport, loading, unloading, and storage of petroleum products (the Facilities\u201d) on behalf of the District, and settle the Jefferson Terminal Credit Agreement. Construction of the Facilities has occurred, and will occur, on property leased by the District to Jefferson Railport II pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Ground Lease between Jefferson Railport II, as lessee, and the District, as lessor. All such Facilities will be leased by the District to Jefferson Railport II pursuant to a Lease and Development Agreement between the District and Jefferson Railport II.\nThe transaction described above did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting due to the continuing involvement of the Company resulting from the mandatory tender feature and, as a result, the leases were classified as a financing transaction in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under the financing method, the assets constructed or to be constructed will remain on the consolidated balance sheet and the net proceeds received by the Company are recorded as financial debt. Payments under these leases are recorded as interest expense and reduction of principal in accordance with the terms of the bond agreement with annual interest payments and a principal repayment at February 13, 2020 barring a remarketing of the bond on new terms.\nUnder a Capital Call Agreement, the Company has agreed to make funds available to Jefferson Holdings in order to satisfy its obligation under the Standby Bond Purchase Agreement. The Capital Call Agreement contains certain covenants applicable to the Company, including a negative lien covenant regarding Aviation Assets, as defined, as well as maintenance of a minimum total asset value of Aviation Assets and minimum total equity of the Company. In connection with the above, related to the Series 2016 Bonds, a subsidiary of the Company and an affiliate of its Manager entered into a Fee and Support Agreement with FTAI Energy Partners LLC and certain of its subsidiaries. The Fee and Support Agreement provides that both such subsidiary of the Company, and such affiliate, will effectively guarantee a pro rata portion of the obligations under the Standby Bond Purchase Agreement in return for a guarantee fee of $6,873 (shared on the same pro rata basis). This fee will be amortized as interest expense to the redemption date or February 13, 2020.\nThe Series 2016 Bonds bear interest at an initial rate of 7.25% and require scheduled interest payments. The Series 2016 Bonds have a stated maturity of February 1, 2036 but are subject to mandatory tender for purchase at par on February 13, 2020 if they have not been repurchased from proceeds of a remarketing of the Series 2016 Bonds or redeemed prior to such date. In the event all of the Series 2016 Bonds are not repurchased from proceeds of a remarketing or redeemed at February 13, 2020, Jefferson Railport and Jefferson Railport Terminal II Holdings LLC ( Jefferson Holdings\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company and parent of Jefferson Railport II, have agreed to purchase the Series 2016 Bonds from the Holders thereof at par pursuant to a Standby Bond Purchase Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Standby Purchase Agreement, Jefferson Holdings will guarantee the payment of all Rent (as defined in the Facilities Lease), and all principal of and premium and interest on the Series 2016 Bonds payable prior to repurchase or redemption at February 13, 2020.\nTerm Loan-On January 23, 2017, the Company entered into an unsecured credit agreement under which the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, including the Partnership and WWTAI Finance Ltd., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of Bermuda, borrowed $100,000 in term loans denominated in U.S. dollars (the Term Loans\u201d). The proceeds of the Term Loans are to be used for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions by the Company and its subsidiaries of certain aviation and infrastructure assets. The Terms Loans bear interest at the Base Rate (determined in accordance with the agreement) plus 2.75% per annum, or at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (determined in accordance with the agreement) plus 3.75% per annum, if the Company chooses to make Eurodollar Rate borrowings. The Term Loans mature on January 22, 2018, subject to the Company's right to elect a one-year extension, and require amortization payments in the amount of $250 on the last day of each fiscal quarter beginning on March 31, 2017. On March 15, 2017, all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan were repaid in full and the agreement was terminated. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2,456.\nSenior Notes-On March 15, 2017, the Company issued $250,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the Senior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 15, 2017, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. On August 23, 2017, the Company issued an additional $100,000 of Senior Notes. The additional notes issued on August 23, 2017 were issued at an offering price of 102.75% of the principal amount plus accrued interest from March 15, 2017 to the date of issuance. On December 20, 2017, the Company issued an additional $100,000 of Senior Notes. The additional notes issued on December 20, 2017 were issued at an offering price of 103.25% of the principal amount plus accrued interest from September 15, 2017.\nThe Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2017, to persons who are registered holders of the Senior Notes on the immediately preceding March 1 and September 1, respectively.\nThe Senior Notes mature on March 15, 2022. Prior to March 15, 2020, the Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, plus a make-whole\u201d premium. On or after March 15, 2020, the Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time at declining redemption prices equal to (i) 105.063% beginning on March 15, 2020, and (ii) 100.000% beginning on March 15, 2021 and thereafter, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date. In addition, at any time on or prior to March 15, 2020, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes using net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.75% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date.\nThe Company used a portion of the proceeds to fully repay all outstanding indebtedness under the Company's Term Loan in the amount of $100,000, payment of fees related to the issuance of Senior Notes, and to fund the purchase of additional investments. The Company intends to use the remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the funding of future investments.\nRevolving Credit Facility-On June 16, 2017, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with certain lenders and issuing banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., as administrative agent. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for revolving loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $75,000, of which $25,000 may be utilized for the issuance of letters of credit. The proceeds drawn on this facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, permitted acquisitions and other investments. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by the capital stock of certain direct subsidiaries of the Company as defined in the related credit agreement.\nBorrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (determined in accordance with the credit agreement) plus 3.00% per annum, if the Company chooses to make Eurodollar Rate borrowings, or at the Base Rate\n(determined in accordance with the credit agreement) plus 2.00% per annum. The Company will also be required to pay a quarterly commitment fee at a rate per annum equal to 0.50% on the average unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, as well as customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility will mature, and commitments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, on June 16, 2020. Any amount borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid without penalty or premium, other than customary breakage costs related to prepayments of Eurodollar Rate Borrowings.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes financial covenants requiring the maintenance of (1) a minimum ratio of the appraised value of certain aviation assets to the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility of 3.00 to 1.00 and (2) a maximum ratio of debt to total equity (before reduction for minority interest) for the Company and its subsidiaries of 1.65 to 1.00 per the terms of the credit agreement.\nThe Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our future obligations, by period due, as of December 31, 2017, under our various contractual obligations and commitments. We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

We expect that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to cover operating expenses and the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness as they become due. We may elect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements or to continue to pursue strategic opportunities through utilizing cash on hand, cash generated from our current operations and the issuance of securities in the future. Management believes adequate capital and borrowings are available from various sources to fund our commitments to the extent required.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nOperating Leases-The Company leases equipment pursuant to net operating leases. Operating leases with fixed rentals and step rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, assuming no renewals. Revenue is not recognized when collection is not reasonably assured. When collectability is not reasonably assured, the customer is placed on non-accrual status and revenue is recognized when cash payments are received.\nThe Company also recognizes maintenance revenue related to the portion of maintenance payments received from lessees of aviation equipment that are not expected to be reimbursed in connection with major maintenance events.\nFinance Lease-The Company holds one anchor handling tug supply vessel, subject to a finance lease, as of December 31, 2017. This lease generally includes a lessee obligation to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term, a bargain purchase option, or provides for minimum lease payments with a present value of 90% or more of the fair value of the leased equipment at the date of lease inception. Net investment in finance lease represents the minimum lease payments due from lessee, net of unearned income. The lease payments are segregated into principal and interest components similar to a loan. Unearned income is recognized on an effective interest method over the lease term and is recorded as finance lease income. The principal component of the lease payment is reflected as a reduction to the net investment in finance leases.\nVariable Interest Entities-The assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and the determination of whether to consolidate a VIE requires judgment. VIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, and only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nMaintenance Payments-Typically, under an operating lease of aircraft, the lessee is responsible for performing all maintenance and is generally required to make maintenance payments to the Company for heavy maintenance, overhaul or replacement of certain high-value components of the aircraft or engine. These maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time, depending on the component, and are generally required to be made monthly in arrears. If a lessee is making monthly maintenance payments, the Company would typically be obligated to reimburse the lessee for costs they incur for heavy maintenance, overhaul or replacement of certain high-value components to the extent of maintenance payments received in respect of the specific maintenance event, usually shortly following the completion of the relevant work.\nThe Company records the portion of maintenance payments paid by the lessee that are expected to be reimbursed as maintenance deposit liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Reimbursements made to the lessee upon the receipt of evidence of qualifying maintenance work are recorded against the maintenance deposit liability.\nIn certain leases, the lessee or the Company may be obligated to make a payment to the other party at lease termination based on redelivery conditions stipulated at the inception of the lease. When the lessee is required to return the aircraft in an improved maintenance condition, the Company records a maintenance right asset, as a component of other assets, for the estimated value of the end-of-life maintenance payment at acquisition. The Company recognizes payments received as end-of-lease compensation adjustments, within lease revenue or as a reduction to the maintenance right asset, when payment is received or collectability is assured. In the event the Company is required to make payments at the end of the lease for redelivery conditions, amounts are accrued as additional maintenance liability when the Company is obligated and can reasonably estimate such payment.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Leasing Equipment and Depreciation-Property, plant and equipment and leasing equipment are stated at cost (inclusive of capitalized acquisition costs, where applicable) and depreciated using the straight-line method, over estimated useful lives, to estimated residual values which are summarized as follows:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Range of Estimated Useful Lives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Residual Value Estimates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25 years from date of manufacture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Generally not to exceed 15% of manufacturer's list price when new\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft engines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 6 years, based on maintenance adjusted service life\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sum of engine core salvage value plus the estimated fair value of life limited parts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore energy vessels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25 years from date of manufacture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20% of new build cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railcars and locomotives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40 - 50 years from date of manufacture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Scrap value at end of useful life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Track and track related assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 - 50 years from date of manufacture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Scrap value at end of useful life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings and site improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20 - 30 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Scrap value at end of useful life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Railroad equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 15 years from date of manufacture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Scrap value at end of useful life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal machinery and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15 - 25 years from date of manufacture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Scrap value at end of useful life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 - 7 years from date of manufacture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Scrap value at end of useful life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture and fixtures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 6 years from date of purchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Computer hardware and software\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years from date of purchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets-The Company performs a recoverability assessment of each of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, or indicators, indicate that the carrying amount or net book value of an asset may not be recoverable. Indicators may include, but are not limited to, a significant lease restructuring or early lease termination; significant traffic decline; or the introduction of newer technology aircraft, vessels, engines or railcars. When performing a recoverability assessment, the Company measures whether the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset exceeds its net book value. The undiscounted cash flows consist of cash flows from currently contracted leases and terminal services contracts, future projected leases, terminal service and freight rail rates, transition costs, estimated down time and estimated residual or scrap values. In the event that an asset does not meet the recoverability test, the carrying value of the asset will be adjusted to fair value resulting in an impairment charge.\nManagement develops the assumptions used in the recoverability analysis based on its knowledge of active contracts, current and future expectations of the global demand for a particular asset and historical experience in the leasing markets, as well as information received from third party industry sources. The factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are impacted by changes in future periods due to changes in contracted lease rates, terminal service, and freight rail rates, residual values, economic conditions, technology, demand for a particular asset type and other factors.\nGoodwill -Goodwill includes the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of CMQR and Jefferson Terminal. The carrying amount of goodwill is approximately $116,584 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nThe Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized. An annual impairment review is conducted as of October 1st of each year. Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.\nFor an annual goodwill impairment assessment, an optional qualitative analysis may be performed. If the option is not elected or if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a two-step goodwill impairment test is performed to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure an impairment loss. A qualitative analysis was not elected for the years ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.\nThe first step of an impairment assessment compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including the Company's assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment that should be recorded, if any.\nFor the purpose of performing the annual analysis, the Company's two reporting units subject to the test are the Jefferson Terminal and Railroad reporting units. The Company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for the reporting units. The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.\nAlthough the Company believes the estimates of fair value are reasonable, the determination of certain valuation inputs is subject to management's judgment. Changes in these inputs could materially affect the results of the impairment review. If the forecasts of cash flows generated by the Jefferson Terminal and Railroad reporting units or other key inputs are negatively revised in the future, the estimated fair value of the Jefferson Terminal and Railroad reporting units would be adversely impacted, potentially leading to an impairment in the future that could materially affect the Company's operating results. Specifically, as it relates to the Jefferson Terminal segment, forecasted revenue is dependent on the ramp up of volumes under current contracts and the acquisition of additional storage contracts for the heavy and light crude and refined products during 2018. The expansion of refineries in the Beaumont/Port Arthur area, as well as growing crude oil production in the U.S. and Canada, are expected to result in increased demand for storage on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Other assumptions that are significant in determination of the fair value of the reporting unit include the discount rate utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis of 14% and our terminal growth rate of 3%.\nFurthermore, development of both inbound and outbound pipelines to and from the Jefferson Terminal over the next two years will affect our forecasted growth and therefore our estimated fair value. We expect the Jefferson Terminal segment to generate positive Adjusted EBITDA during 2018. The Company's estimated fair value exceeded carrying value by greater than 15%.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there was no impairment of goodwill.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing for recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed discussion of Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC, its business activities, acquisitions, and financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help you understand Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC (the Company\u201d). The Company's MD&A should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, and with Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe own and acquire high quality infrastructure and related equipment that is essential for the transportation of goods and people globally. We target assets that, on a combined basis, generate strong cash flows with potential for earnings growth and asset appreciation. We believe that there are a large number of acquisition opportunities in our markets, and that our Manager's expertise and business and financing relationships, together with our access to capital, will allow us to take advantage of these opportunities. We are externally managed by FIG LLC (the Manager\u201d), an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC ( Fortress\u201d), which has a dedicated team of experienced professionals focused on the acquisition of transportation and infrastructure assets since 2002. As of December 31, 2017, we had total consolidated assets of $2.0 billion and total equity of $1.0 billion.\nAt December 31, 2014, through their investment in the Company, the beneficial owners of the Fortress Worldwide Transportation and Infrastructure General Partnership were Fortress Worldwide Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LP (the Onshore Fund\u201d), with an 89.97% interest and Fortress Worldwide Transportation and Infrastructure Offshore LP (the Offshore Fund\u201d) with a 9.98% interest; in addition, Fortress Worldwide Transportation and Infrastructure Master GP LLP (the Master GP\u201d) held a 0.05% interest. The Master GP is owned by an affiliate of Fortress. The Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund (collectively, the Initial Shareholders\u201d) were investment vehicles which were sponsored by Fortress. The general partner of the Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund was an affiliate of Fortress.\nIn May 2015, the remaining capital commitments of the investors of the Onshore Fund, Offshore Fund and Master GP were called. Through a series of transactions, the Master GP contributed its rights to previously undistributed incentive allocations pursuant to the Partnership Agreement in exchange for the limited partnership interests in the Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund equal to the amount of any such undistributed incentive allocations and 53,502,873 common shares were issued to the Onshore Fund and Offshore Fund based on their relative interests in the Company. In November 2015, the Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund each distributed to their respective limited partners the common shares allocated to their limited partners in accordance with their respective limited partnership agreements.\nOn May 20, 2015, we completed an IPO of 20 million common shares at a price to the public of $17.00 per share. On June 15, 2015, the underwriters exercised their overallotment option, pursuant to which we issued an additional 2.2 million shares to such underwriters at the IPO price.\nWhile our strategy permits us to acquire a broad array of transportation-related assets, we are currently active in five sectors where we believe there are meaningful opportunities to deploy capital to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns: aviation, energy, intermodal transport, rail and ports and terminals.\n \u2022 Commercial air travel and air freight activity have historically been long-term growth sectors and are tied to the underlying demand for passenger and freight movement. We continue to see strong demand for aviation related assets. \n \u2022 Offshore energy service equipment refers to vessels supporting the extraction, processing and transportation of oil and natural gas from deposits located beneath the sea floor. The recent oil price decline has led to oil and gas companies reducing and deferring spending decisions, creating an oversupply of offshore energy assets, and in turn, lower day-rates, utilization and earnings for offshore service companies. \n \u2022 The intermodal transport market includes the efficient movement of goods throughout multiple modes of transportation, making it possible to move cargo from a point of origin to a final destination without repeated unpacking and repacking. Over the last year, new container prices have increased substantially, which has led to a rebound in lease rates and residual values from the lows of 2015 and 2016. \n \u2022 Rail refers to the railroad industry, which has increased its share of freight ton-miles compared to other forms of freight transportation over the past quarter century. This infrastructure, most of which was originally established over 100 years ago, represents a limited supply of assets and a difficult-to-replicate network. We continue to see increased volumes and efficiencies on our network since our investment in CMQR in 2014. \n \u2022 Land-based infrastructure refers to facilities that enable the storage, unloading, loading and movement of crude oil and refined products from producers to end users, such as refineries. Customers of land-based infrastructure typically purchase capacity on a take-or-pay basis, and the economics of these assets directly relate to the volume of throughput.  Operating Segments\nOur operations consist of two primary strategic business units - Infrastructure and Equipment Leasing. Our Infrastructure Business acquires long-lived assets that provide mission-critical services or functions to transportation networks and typically have high barriers to entry. The Company targets or develops operating businesses with strong margins, stable cash flows and upside from earnings growth and asset appreciation driven by increased use and inflation. Our Equipment Leasing Business acquires assets that are designed to carry cargo or people or provide functionality to transportation infrastructure. Transportation equipment assets are typically long-lived, moveable and leased by us on either operating leases or finance leases to companies that provide transportation services. Our leases generally provide for long-term contractual cash flow with high cash-on-cash yields and include structural protections to mitigate credit risk.\nOur reportable segments are comprised of interests in different types of infrastructure and equipment leasing assets. We currently conduct our business through our corporate operating segment and the following six reportable segments: i) Aviation Leasing, ii) Offshore Energy, iii) Shipping Containers, all of which are within Equipment Leasing Business, and iv) Jefferson Terminal, v) Railroad, and vi) Ports and Terminals which together comprise our Infrastructure Business. The Aviation Leasing segment consists of aircraft and aircraft engines held for lease and are typically held long-term. The Offshore Energy segment consists of vessels and equipment that support offshore oil and gas activities and are typically subject to long-term operating leases. The Shipping Containers segment consists of an investment in an unconsolidated entity engaged in the leasing of shipping containers on both an operating lease and finance lease basis. The Jefferson Terminal segment consists of a multi-modal crude and refined products terminal and other related assets which were acquired in 2014. The Railroad segment consists of our Central Maine and Quebec Railway ( CMQR\u201d) short line railroad operations also acquired in 2014. Ports and Terminals consists of Repauno, acquired in 2016, a 1,630 acre deep-water port located along the Delaware River with an underground storage cavern and multiple industrial development opportunities, and Long Ridge, acquired in June 2017, a 1,660 acre multi-modal port located along the Ohio River with rail, dock, and multiple industrial development opportunities. The Corporate operating segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses and management fees.\nThe Company's reportable segments are comprised of investments in different types of transportation infrastructure and equipment. Each segment requires different investment strategies. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies; however, financial information presented by segment includes the impact of intercompany eliminations.\nResults of Operations\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) (Non-GAAP)\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d) utilizes Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as the key performance measure. This performance measure provides the CODM with the information necessary to assess operational performance, as well as make resource and allocation decisions.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, adjusted (a) to exclude the impact of provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition and transaction expenses, losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments, asset impairment charges, incentive allocations, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, (b) to include the impact of cash income tax payments, and our pro-rata share of the Adjusted Net Income from unconsolidated entities, and (c) to exclude the impact of the non-controlling share of Adjusted Net Income. We evaluate investment performance for each reportable segment primarily based on Adjusted Net Income. We believe that net income attributable to shareholders, as defined by GAAP, is the most comparable earnings measurement with which to reconcile Adjusted Net Income.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA as a secondary measurement to Adjusted Net Income, which we believe serves as a useful supplement to investors, analysts and management to measure economic performance of deployed revenue generating assets between periods on a consistent basis, and which we believe measures our financial performance and helps identify operational\nfactors that management can impact in the short-term, namely our cost structure and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other entities may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted (a) to exclude the impact of provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition and transaction expenses, losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments, asset impairment charges, incentive allocations, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense, (b) to include the impact of our pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, and (c) to exclude the impact of equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and the non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table presents our consolidated results of operations and reconciliation of net loss attributable to shareholders to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) from unconsolidated entities includes the Company's proportionate share of the unconsolidated entities' net income adjusted for the excluded and included items detailed in the table above.\n(2) Non-controlling share of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is comprised of the following for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) equity-based compensation of $169 and $(1,561), (ii) provision for income tax of $16 and $29, (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt of $0 and $616, (iv) asset impairment charges of $0 and $3,725, (v) acquisition and transaction expense of $0 and $156, (vi) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $404 and $0, less (vii) cash tax payments of $31 and $20, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net loss attributable to shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\n\n________________________________________________________\n(3) Depreciation and amortization expense includes $88,110 and $60,210 of depreciation and amortization expense, $4,716 and $4,979 of lease intangible amortization, and $3,591 and $467 of amortization for lease incentives in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(4) Pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities includes the following items for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) net loss of $1,786 and $6,161, (ii) interest expense of $785 and $1,323, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of $758 and $2,966, and (iv) asset impairment charges of $0 and $3,068, respectively.\n(5) Non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of the following items for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: (i) equity based compensation of $169 and $(1,561), (ii) provision for income taxes of $16 and $29, (iii) interest expense of $5,030 and $5,124, (iv) depreciation and amortization expense of $7,144 and $6,564, (v) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $404 and $0, (vi) asset impairment charge of $0 and $3,725, (vii) loss on extinguishment of debt of $0 and $616, and (viii) transaction and acquisition expense of $0 and $156, respectively.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 total revenues increased $68,939 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven mainly by higher revenues in the Aviation, Offshore Energy and Ports and Terminals segments partially offset by lower revenues in the Jefferson Terminal segment.\nIn Equipment Leasing, lease income increased $29,800 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by an increase in assets on lease in the Aviation Leasing segment coupled with vessels on hire in the Offshore Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2017. Maintenance revenue increased by $36,954 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as we increased the number of aircraft and engines subject to leases with maintenance arrangements and the redelivery of two aircraft with end of lease compensation payments totaling $6,338 in the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, other revenues increased $2,484 mainly as a result of crew and insurance reimbursement income in the Offshore Energy segment.\nIn Infrastructure, other revenue increased $3,712 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to activity at Long Ridge, which was acquired in 2017. Rail revenues increased $1,770 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in traffic and expanded service offerings by our Railroad segment. Partially offsetting these increases was lower revenue of $5,673 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 in the Jefferson Terminal segment due to a decrease in loading and unloading due to ongoing construction at the terminal and the conclusion of a long term take or pay contract.\nExpenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total expenses increased $76,222 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in i) depreciation and amortization, ii) operating expenses and iii) interest expense.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $27,900 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to additional assets acquired in the Aviation Leasing segment coupled with assets at Long Ridge and Repauno going into service.\nOperating expenses increased $26,216 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in i) compensation and benefits of $8,896 primarily reflecting an increase in equity-based compensation expense due to the reversal of an expense related to a forfeiture in 2016, ii) facility operations of $5,813 primarily in the Jefferson Terminal and Railroad segments due to increases in volume, iii) operating expenses of $4,149 related to the Offshore Energy segment, iv) professional fees of $4,031 related to an increase in activity and v) cost of sales of $1,977 reflecting the sale of butane in 2017.\nInterest expense increased $19,870 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the Senior Notes and Revolving Line of Credit entered into during 2017.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nTotal other income (expense) increased $26,327 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to higher gain on the sale of assets, net of $12,340, reflecting the sale of available-for-sale securities of an international oil and gas drilling contractor in the Offshore Energy segment. Also contributing to the increase was the asset impairment charge in 2016 of $7,450, where there was no asset impairment charge in 2017 and a decrease in the equity in losses of unconsolidated entities of $4,391.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes increased $1,686 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in net income attributable to the Company's corporate subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxation at regular corporate rates.\nNet Loss\nNet loss attributable to shareholders decreased $20,198 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the changes discussed above.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted Net Income was $10,401, an increase of $19,033 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in revenue, expenses and other expenses noted above, the increase in the period was driven by an increase in (i) equity based compensation of $5,015, (ii) pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Income from unconsolidated entities of $1,304, and (iii) non-controlling share of Adjusted Net income of $2,387. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges of $7,450 and equity in losses of unconsolidated entities of $4,391.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $136,524 for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing $67,496 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in revenue, expenses and other losses noted above, which resulted in a net income attributable to shareholders, the change was primarily due to (i) depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) interest expense, (iii) the pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, (iv) lower equity-based compensation, (v) lower non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA, and (vi) equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities.\nAviation Leasing Segment\nAs of December 31, 2017, in our Aviation Leasing segment, we own and manage 158 aviation assets, including 48 aircraft and 110 commercial jet engines.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 46 of our commercial aircraft and 76 of our jet engines were leased to operators or other third parties. Aviation assets currently off lease are either undergoing repair and/or maintenance, being prepared to go on lease or held in short term storage awaiting a future lease. Our aviation equipment was approximately 86% utilized as of December 31, 2017, based on the equity value of our on-hire leasing equipment as a percentage of the total equity value of our aviation leasing equipment. Our aircraft currently have a weighted average remaining lease term of 32 months, and our engines currently on-lease have an average remaining lease term of 11 months. The table below provides additional information on the assets in our Aviation Leasing segment:\n\nThe following table presents our results of operations and reconciliation of net income attributable to shareholders to Adjusted Net Income for the Aviation Leasing segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\n\n(1) Pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Income from unconsolidated entities includes Aviation's proportionate share of the unconsolidated entities' net income adjusted for the excluded and included items detailed in the table above, for which there were no adjustments.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income attributable to shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA for the Aviation Leasing segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Depreciation and amortization expense includes $61,795 and $36,369 of depreciation expense, $4,716 and $4,979 of lease intangible amortization, and $3,591 and $468 of amortization for lease incentives in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(2) Aviation Leasing's pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities includes net loss of $1,276 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(3) Non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of depreciation and lease amortization expense of $537 and $164 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $61,385 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, driven by higher lease income and maintenance revenue partially offset by a decrease in other", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

on extinguishment of debt of $0 and $616, and (viii) transaction and acquisition expense of $0 and $156, respectively.\nRevenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 total revenues increased $68,939 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven mainly by higher revenues in the Aviation, Offshore Energy and Ports and Terminals segments partially offset by lower revenues in the Jefferson Terminal segment.\nIn Equipment Leasing, lease income increased $29,800 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by an increase in assets on lease in the Aviation Leasing segment coupled with vessels on hire in the Offshore Energy segment during the year ended December 31, 2017. Maintenance revenue increased by $36,954 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as we increased the number of aircraft and engines subject to leases with maintenance arrangements and the redelivery of two aircraft with end of lease compensation payments totaling $6,338 in the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, other revenues increased $2,484 mainly as a result of crew and insurance reimbursement income in the Offshore Energy segment.\nIn Infrastructure, other revenue increased $3,712 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to activity at Long Ridge, which was acquired in 2017. Rail revenues increased $1,770 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in traffic and expanded service offerings by our Railroad segment. Partially offsetting these increases was lower revenue of $5,673 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 in the Jefferson Terminal segment due to a decrease in loading and unloading due to ongoing construction at the terminal and the conclusion of a long term take or pay contract.\nExpenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total expenses increased $76,222 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in i) depreciation and amortization, ii) operating expenses and iii) interest expense.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $27,900 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to additional assets acquired in the Aviation Leasing segment coupled with assets at Long Ridge and Repauno going into service.\nOperating expenses increased $26,216 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in i) compensation and benefits of $8,896 primarily reflecting an increase in equity-based compensation expense due to the reversal of an expense related to a forfeiture in 2016, ii) facility operations of $5,813 primarily in the Jefferson Terminal and Railroad segments due to increases in volume, iii) operating expenses of $4,149 related to the Offshore Energy segment, iv) professional fees of $4,031 related to an increase in activity and v) cost of sales of $1,977 reflecting the sale of butane in 2017.\nInterest expense increased $19,870 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the Senior Notes and Revolving Line of Credit entered into during 2017.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nTotal other income (expense) increased $26,327 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to higher gain on the sale of assets, net of $12,340, reflecting the sale of available-for-sale securities of an international oil and gas drilling contractor in the Offshore Energy segment. Also contributing to the increase was the asset impairment charge in 2016 of $7,450, where there was no asset impairment charge in 2017 and a decrease in the equity in losses of unconsolidated entities of $4,391.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes increased $1,686 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in net income attributable to the Company's corporate subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxation at regular corporate rates.\nNet Loss\nNet loss attributable to shareholders decreased $20,198 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the changes discussed above.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted Net Income was $10,401, an increase of $19,033 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in revenue, expenses and other expenses noted above, the increase in the period was driven by an increase in (i) equity based compensation of $5,015, (ii) pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Income from unconsolidated entities of $1,304, and (iii) non-controlling share of Adjusted Net income of $2,387. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges of $7,450 and equity in losses of unconsolidated entities of $4,391.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $136,524 for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing $67,496 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the changes in revenue, expenses and other losses noted above, which resulted in a net income attributable to shareholders, the change was primarily due to (i) depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) interest expense, (iii) the pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, (iv) lower equity-based compensation, (v) lower non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA, and (vi) equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities.\nAviation Leasing Segment\nAs of December 31, 2017, in our Aviation Leasing segment, we own and manage 158 aviation assets, including 48 aircraft and 110 commercial jet engines.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 46 of our commercial aircraft and 76 of our jet engines were leased to operators or other third parties. Aviation assets currently off lease are either undergoing repair and/or maintenance, being prepared to go on lease or held in short term storage awaiting a future lease. Our aviation equipment was approximately 86% utilized as of December 31, 2017, based on the equity value of our on-hire leasing equipment as a percentage of the total equity value of our aviation leasing equipment. Our aircraft currently have a weighted average remaining lease term of 32 months, and our engines currently on-lease have an average remaining lease term of 11 months.
