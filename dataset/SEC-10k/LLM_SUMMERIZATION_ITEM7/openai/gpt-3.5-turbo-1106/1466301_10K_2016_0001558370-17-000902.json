Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents in the United States, Europe and additional international markets. We target our development programs for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations, and simultaneously develop, with partners, diagnostic tools intended to direct a compound in development to the population that is most likely to benefit from its use.\nOur commercial product Rubraca (rucaparib) is the first and only oral, small molecule poly ADP-ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 approved in the United States by the FDA as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA (human genes associated with the repair of damaged DNA) mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.\nThe MAA submission with the EMA for a comparable ovarian cancer indication was accepted by the EMA during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, rucaparib is being studied as a potential maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer patients in the ARIEL3 trial. Data from ARIEL3 is anticipated in mid-2017. Pending positive data from ARIEL3, we intend to follow up with a supplemental NDA for second-line maintenance therapy in women with ovarian cancer who have responded to platinum-based therapy. Rucaparib is also being developed in patients with mutant BRCA tumors and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA - commonly referred to as homologous recombination deficiencies. Studies open for enrollment or under consideration include prostate, breast, pancreatic, gastroesophageal, bladder and lung cancers. We hold worldwide rights for rucaparib.\nIn addition, we have two other product candidates: lucitanib, an oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) alpha and beta and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1-3, and rociletinib, an oral mutant-selective inhibitor of EGFR. Clinical development for each of these candidates has ceased and we continue to provide drug to patients whose clinicians recommend continuing therapy. We maintain certain development and commercialization rights for lucitanib and global development and commercialization rights for rociletinib.\nWe commenced operations in April 2009. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to identifying and in-licensing product candidates, performing development activities with respect to those product candidates and the general and administrative support of these operations. Through December 31, 2016, we have generated $13.6 million in license and milestone revenue related to our collaboration and license agreement with Servier and have generated $0.1 million product revenue related to sales of Rubraca, which we began to commercialize on December 19, 2016. We have principally funded our operations using the net proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, public offerings of our common stock and our convertible senior notes offering.\nWe have never been profitable and, as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,131.0 million. We incurred net losses of $349.1 million, $352.9 million and $160.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $266.2 million at December 31, 2016.\nWe expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, as we incur costs related to commercial activities associated with Rubraca. In January 2017, we sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at $41.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were $221.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding commercial planning and sales and marketing expenses associated with the launch of Rubraca in the United States and, if approved by the EMA, in Europe, funding of our development programs, selling, general and administrative expenses, acquisition or licensing of additional product candidates or businesses and working capital. Based on our current estimates, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities will allow us to fund activities through at least the next 12 months. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from Rubraca, we expect to finance our operations in part through additional public or private equity or debt offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nProduct License Agreements\nRucaparib\nIn June 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer Inc. to acquire exclusive global development and commercialization rights to rucaparib. The exclusive rights are exclusive even as to Pfizer and include the right to grant sublicenses. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made a $7.0 million upfront payment to Pfizer. In April 2014, we initiated a pivotal registration study for rucaparib, which resulted in a $0.4 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. In September 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.5 million to Pfizer upon acceptance of the NDA for rucaparib by the FDA. The MAA submission with the EMA for a comparable ovarian cancer indication was completed and accepted by the MAA during the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a $0.5 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. These payments were recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense.\nOn August 30, 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the worldwide license agreement with Pfizer, which amends the June 2011 existing worldwide license agreement to permit us to defer payment of the milestone payments payable upon (i) FDA approval of an NDA for 1st Indication in US and (ii) EMA approval of an MAA for 1st Indication in EU, to a date that is 18 months after the date of achievement of such milestones. In the event that we defer such milestone payments, we have agreed to certain higher payments related to the achievement of such milestones.\nOn December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated with advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. The FDA approval resulted in a $0.75 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. The FDA approval also resulted in the obligation to pay a $20.0 million milestone payment, for which we have exercised the option to defer payment by agreeing to pay $23.0 million within 18 months after the date of the FDA approval. These payments were recognized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib.\nWe are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize rucaparib and we are responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for rucaparib. We are required to make regulatory milestone payments to Pfizer of up to an additional $69.75 million in aggregate if specified clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are obligated to make sales milestone payments to Pfizer if specified annual sales targets for rucaparib are met, the majority of which relate to annual sales targets of $500.0 million and above, which, in the aggregate, could amount to total milestone payments of $170.0 million, and tiered royalty payments at a mid-teen percentage rate on our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize rucaparib.\nThe license agreement with Pfizer will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Pfizer, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Pfizer can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to rucaparib and an obligation to assign or license to Pfizer any intellectual property rights or other rights we may have in rucaparib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for rucaparib.\nIn April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited to acquire exclusive rights associated with rucaparib under a family of patents and patent applications that claim methods of treating patients with\nPARP inhibitors in certain indications. The license enables the development and commercialization of rucaparib for the uses claimed by these patents. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made an upfront payment of $0.25 million upon execution of the agreement. During the second quarter of 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.3 million to AstraZeneca upon the NDA submission for rucaparib. These payments were recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense. The FDA approval of rucaparib on December 19, 2016 resulted in a $0.35 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca as required by the license agreement. This payment was recognized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib. AstraZeneca will also receive royalties on any net sales of rucaparib.\nLucitanib\nIn October 2008, EOS (now known as Clovis Oncology Italy S.r.l.) entered into an exclusive license agreement with Advenchen to develop and commercialize lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China. We are obligated to pay Advenchen tiered royalties at percentage rates in the mid-single digits on net sales of lucitanib, based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. In addition, after giving effect to the first and second amendments to the license agreement, we are required to pay to Advenchen 25% of any consideration, excluding royalties, we receive from sublicensees, in lieu of the milestone obligations set forth in the agreement. We are obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product containing lucitanib, and we are also responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for lucitanib. In the first quarter of 2014, we recognized acquired in-process research and development expense of $3.4 million, which represents 25% of the sublicense agreement consideration of $13.6 million received from Servier upon the end of opposition and appeal of the lucitanib patent by the European Patent Office.\nThe license agreement with Advenchen will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations to Advenchen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Advenchen can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to lucitanib.\nIn September 2012, EOS entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Servier whereby EOS sublicensed to Servier exclusive rights to develop and commercialize lucitanib in all countries outside of the U.S., Japan and China. In exchange for these rights, EOS received an upfront payment of \u20ac45.0 million. We are entitled to receive additional payments upon achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to \u20ac100.0 million in the aggregate, \u20ac10.0 million of which was received in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, we are entitled to receive sales milestone payments if specified annual sales targets for lucitanib are met, which, in the aggregate, could total \u20ac250.0 million. We are also entitled to receive royalties on sales of lucitanib by Servier.\nWe and Servier are developing lucitanib pursuant to a development plan agreed to between the parties. Servier is responsible for all of the global development costs for lucitanib up to \u20ac80.0 million. Cumulative global development costs in excess of \u20ac80.0 million, if any, will be shared equally between us and Servier. During the second quarter of 2016, we and Servier agreed to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer and lung cancer and are continuing to evaluate what, if any, further development of lucitanib will be pursued. Based on current estimates, we expect to complete the committed on-going development activities in 2017 and expect full reimbursement of our development costs from Servier. Reimbursements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRociletinib\nIn May 2010, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Celgene to discover, develop and commercialize a covalent inhibitor of mutant forms of the EGFR gene product. Rociletinib was identified as the lead inhibitor candidate under the license agreement. We are responsible for all non-clinical, clinical, regulatory and other activities necessary to develop and commercialize rociletinib.\nWe made an upfront payment of $2.0 million upon execution of the license agreement, a $4.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2012 upon the acceptance by the FDA of our IND application for rociletinib and a $5.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2014 upon the initiation of the Phase II study for rociletinib. In the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for\nrociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. We recognized all payments prior to commercial approval as acquired in-process research and development expense.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we received a CRL from the FDA for the rociletinib NDA. The FDA issues a CRL to indicate that their review of an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. In anticipation of receiving the CRL, we terminated enrollment in all ongoing sponsored clinical studies, although we continue to provide drug to patients whose clinicians recommend continuing rociletinib therapy. In addition, we withdrew our MAA for rociletinib on file with the EMA. We are continuing analyses of rociletinib data to determine whether certain populations of patients may represent an opportunity for a partner committed to investing in further clinical development.\nWe are obligated to pay royalties at percentage rates ranging from mid-single digits to low-teens based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. We are required to pay up to an additional aggregate of $98.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments if certain clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are required to pay up to an aggregate of $120.0 million in sales milestone payments if certain annual sales targets are achieved.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have generated $13.6 million in license and milestone revenue related to our collaboration and license agreement with Servier. During December 2016, we recorded $0.1 million revenue related to sales of Rubraca, which we began to commercialize on December 19, 2016. For further discussion of our revenue recognition policy, see Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\u201d below. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize products. Any inability on our part to successfully commercialize Rubraca in the United States and any foreign territories where it may be approved, or any significant delay in such approvals, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy and, ultimately, to generate sufficient revenues from Rubraca to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates and companion diagnostics, which include:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nlicense fees and milestone payments related to the acquisition of in-licensed products, which are reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as acquired in-process research and development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nemployee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations ( CROs\u201d) and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncosts associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmarket research, disease education and other commercial product planning activities, including the hiring of a U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organization in preparation for commercial launch of rucaparib; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nactivities associated with the development of companion diagnostics for our product candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. License fees and milestone payments related to in-licensed products and technology are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical supply, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. As a result of the FDA approval of Rubraca and the discontinuation of enrollment in rociletinib, our research and development expenses will decrease for 2017 as we continue to commercialize Rubraca and commercialization related expenses are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses and not research and development costs.\nThe following table identifies research and development and acquired in-process research and development costs on a program-specific basis for our products under development. Personnel-related costs, depreciation and share-based compensation are not allocated to specific programs, as they are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, are separately classified as personnel and other expenses in the table below.\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRucaparib Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n101,598 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58,922 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,010 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquired in-process R&D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,300 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRucaparib Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n102,898 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,922 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,410 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLucitanib Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,337) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,923 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(491) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquired in-process R&D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,406 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLucitanib Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,337) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,923 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,915 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRociletinib Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,768 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n122,912 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69,920 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquired in-process R&D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRociletinib Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,768 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n134,912 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74,920 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n107,100 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n85,494 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,266 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n252,429 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n281,251 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n146,511 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)This amount reflects actual costs incurred less amounts due from Servier for reimbursable development expenses pursuant to the collaboration and license agreement described in Note 11, License Agreements, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses increased significantly from 2014 through 2015 due to the expansion of our clinical development activities for rociletinib and rucaparib. In addition, during 2015, we increased commercial product planning activities in anticipation of the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch in the U.S. of rociletinib. These activities included the hiring of our U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organizations. For 2016, research and development expenses decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to decreased development activities for the rociletinib program, partially offset by higher expenses related to the rucaparib program.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, legal, investor relations, human resources and information technology functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facilities expenses, communication expenses, information technology costs, corporate insurance and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. With the FDA approval of Rubraca on December 19, 2016, all sales and marketing expenses associated with Rubraca are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nEffective May 9, 2016, at Mr. Mahaffy's request, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved his waiver of any annual base salary in excess of $1.00, plus the cost of the employee portion of any premiums to be paid pursuant to any health and welfare benefit plans maintained by us and any tax withholdings related to health and welfare benefits. Such waiver continued in effect until the earliest to occur of (i) the Company entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction that if consummated would constitute a Change in Control (as defined in his Employment Agreement) or the public announcement of a proposal or transaction that if consummated would constitute a Change of Control, (ii) approval by the FDA to commercially distribute, sell or market rucaparib, and (iii) termination of his employment by the Company without Just Cause or by Mr. Mahaffy for Good Reason (each as defined in his Employment Agreement). On December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca resulting in the discontinuation of Mr. Mahaffy's waiver.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses consist of upfront payments to acquire a new drug compound, as well as subsequent milestone payments. Acquired in-process research and development payments are immediately expensed provided that the drug has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and, absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use. Once regulatory approval is received, payments to acquire rights, and the related milestone payments, are capitalized and the amortization of such assets recorded to product cost of sales.\nImpairment of Intangible Asset\nIn connection with the acquisition of EOS in November 2013, we recorded intangible assets to reflect the fair value of acquired in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d) as of the acquisition date. The fair value was established based upon discounted cash flow models using assumptions related to the timing of development, probability of development and regulatory success, sales and commercialization factors and estimated product life. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $104.5 million impairment charge due to our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the IPR&D intangible asset recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was zero. Previously, the Company recorded an $89.6 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Purchase Consideration\nIn connection with the acquisition of EOS in November 2013, we also recorded a purchase consideration liability equal to the estimated fair value of future payments that are contingent upon the achievement of various regulatory and sales milestones. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we re-measure contingent consideration arrangements at fair value each reporting period and record changes in fair value to change in fair value of contingent purchase consideration and foreign currency gains (losses) for changes in the foreign currency translation rate on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in fair value are primarily attributed to new information about the likelihood of achieving such milestones and the passage of time. In the absence of new information, changes to fair value reflect only the passage of time as we progress towards the achievement of future milestones. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $25.5 million reduction in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liability due to our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the contingent purchase consideration liability recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets remained at zero due to the uncertainty of achieving any of the lucitanib regulatory milestones, and therefore the remote likelihood of future milestone payout amounts to the former EOS shareholders.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions with CROs, investigational sites and contract manufacturers where payments are made in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, a significant portion of the contingent purchase consideration liability will be settled in Euro-denominated payments if certain future milestones are achieved and is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Other expense also includes interest expense recognized related to our convertible senior notes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and revenue and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to contingent purchase consideration, the allocation of purchase consideration, intangible asset impairment, clinical trial accruals and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfees paid to CROs in connection with clinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfees paid to vendors in connection with non-clinical development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfees paid to vendors associated with the development of companion diagnostics; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfees paid to vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Based on the amount of accrued research and development expenses as of December 31, 2016, if our estimates of our net accrued liabilities are too high or too low by 5%, this could increase or decrease our research and development expenses by approximately $1.8 million.\nShare-Based Compensation\nDetermining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the expected dividend yield, price volatility of our common stock, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the expected term of our stock options. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends.\nThe fair value of stock options for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions for the respective periods:\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVolatility (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRisk-free interest rate (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.77 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.77 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.92 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected term (years) (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Volatility: The expected volatility was estimated using our historical data.\n(b)Risk-free interest rate: The rate is based on the yield on the grant date of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the option's expected term.\n(c)Expected term: The expected term of the award was estimated using our historical data.\nWe recognized share-based compensation expense of approximately $39.8 million, $40.4 million and $21.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had $86.8 million in total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of related forfeiture estimates, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of 3.1 years. We expect our share-based compensation to continue to grow in future periods due to the potential increases in the value of our common stock and headcount.\nWe are required to estimate the level of forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest.\nValuation of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business Combination\nContingent consideration resulting from a business combination is reported at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each subsequent reporting period, the contingent consideration obligations are revalued and changes in fair value are recorded to change in fair value of contingent purchase consideration and foreign currency gains (losses) for changes in the foreign currency translation rate on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nChanges to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates and time periods, updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestone or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and regulatory approvals. The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration require significant judgment and changes to the assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of expense recorded in any given period. The acquisition of EOS resulted in the recognition of a contingent consideration liability, based on assumptions related to potential future payout amounts, estimated discount rate, probability of success for each milestone achievement and the estimated timing of the milestone payments to the former EOS shareholders.\nDuring the second quarter 2016, we recorded $25.5 million reduction in fair value of the contingent purchase consideration due to our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the contingent purchase consideration liability recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets remained at zero due to the uncertainty of achieving any of the lucitanib regulatory milestones, and therefore the remote likelihood of future milestone payout amounts to the former EOS shareholders.\nIntangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets related to capitalized milestones under license agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their remaining useful lives, which are estimated to be the remaining patent life. If our estimate of the product's useful life is shorter than the remaining patent life, then a shorter period is used. Amortization expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIPR&D assets were established as part of the acquisition of EOS in November 2013 and have not been amortized, but have been assessed for impairment.\nIntangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Events that could result in an impairment, or trigger an interim impairment assessment, include the decision to\ndiscontinue the development of a drug, the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding our drug candidate or a potentially competitive drug candidate, changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate, or new information regarding potential sales for the drug. In connection with any impairment assessment, the fair value of the intangible assets as of the date of assessment is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying value of an intangible asset is both not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $104.5 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible assets due to our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer, thereby reducing the remaining carrying value to zero.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe are currently approved to sell Rubraca in the United States markets. We distribute our product principally through a limited number of specialty distributor and specialty pharmacy providers, collectively, our customers. Our customers subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. Separately, we have arrangements with certain payors and other third parties that provide for government-mandated and privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts.\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title of the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer has been reasonably assured and all performance obligations have been met and returns and allowances can be reasonably estimated. Product sales are recorded net of estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other deductions as well as estimated product returns. Estimating rebates, chargebacks, discounts, product returns and other deductions requires significant judgments about future events and uncertainties, and requires us to rely heavily on assumptions, as well as historical experience. We only recognize revenue on product sales once the product is resold to the patient or healthcare provider by the specialty distributor or specialty pharmacy provider, therefore reducing the significance of estimates made for product returns.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $0.1 million of product revenue. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, certain of the costs of Rubraca units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 were expensed prior to the December 19, 2016 FDA approval, and therefore are not included in cost of sales during the current period. We expect cost of sales to increase in relation to product revenues as we deplete these inventories. We expect to use the remaining pre-commercialization inventory for product sales through the third quarter of 2017.\nRevenue is recognized from milestone payments when the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We exercise judgment in determining that collectability is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectability based primarily on the customer's payment history and creditworthiness of the customer. Payments that are contingent upon the achievement of a milestone will be recognized in the period in which the milestone is achieved.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nLicense and Milestone Revenue. License and milestone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the recognition of $13.6 million of milestone revenue from Servier upon the end of opposition and appeal of the lucitanib patent by the European Patent Office in the first quarter of 2014. We did not recognize any license and milestone revenue in 2016 and 2015.\nProduct Revenue, Net. Product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the recognition of $0.1 million of product revenue from the sale of Rubraca, which was approved for sale in the United States markets on December 19, 2016.\nCost of Sales - Product. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 consists of costs associated with the sale of Rubraca, mainly freight, royalties and amortization of capitalized acquired intangible license right and milestone\npayments related to Rubraca. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, certain of the costs of Rubraca units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 were expensed prior to the December 19, 2016 FDA approval, and therefore are not included in costs of sales during the current period. We expect cost of sales to increase in relation to product revenues as we deplete these inventories and amortize the capitalized acquired intangible license rights and milestone payments related to Rubraca. We expect to use the remaining pre-commercialization inventory for product sales through the third quarter of 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n251,129 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n269,251 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n137,705 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease (decrease) from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(18,122) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n131,546 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n95.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreased development activities for the rociletinib program partially offset by higher expenses related to the rucaparib program.\nClinical trial costs for rucaparib were $14.0 million higher in 2016 than the prior year primarily due to higher enrollment in the ARIEL2 and ARIEL3 studies in ovarian cancer. Market research, disease education and other commercial product planning activities were $16.6 million higher than the prior year due to the preparation for the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of rucaparib. Clinical supply and related manufacturing development costs were $9.2 million higher than the prior year, as we increased production to support the expanded clinical studies. In addition, diagnostic development costs for rucaparib were $0.9 million higher than the prior year due to the advancement of our collaboration with Foundation Medicine, Inc. to develop a novel companion diagnostic test to identify patients most likely to respond to rucaparib.\nSalaries, share-based compensation expense and other personnel-related costs were $24.0 million higher in 2016 driven by increased headcount to support our expanded development and commercial planning activities. During the third quarter of 2015, we completed the hiring of our U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organization in preparation for the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of rociletinib.\nClinical trial costs for rociletinib were $41.0 million lower in 2016 than the prior year primarily due to the completion of patient enrollment in the TIGER-1, TIGER-2 and TIGER-X studies in non-small cell lung cancer. This decrease was partially offset by higher clinical trial costs for the TIGER-3 study, which began enrolling patients during the second quarter of 2015. Market research, disease education and other commercial planning activities were $19.7 million lower than the prior year. We incurred higher costs during 2015 due to the preparation for the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of rociletinib. In addition, clinical supply and related manufacturing development costs were $17.2 million lower than the prior year driven by timing of production to support our clinical studies.\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased development activities for the rociletinib and rucaparib programs.\nClinical trial costs for rucaparib were $10.3 million higher in 2015 than the prior year primarily due to higher enrollment in the ARIEL2 and ARIEL3 studies in ovarian cancer, as well as the expansion of Study 010 in 2015. Development costs for rucaparib were $5.9 million higher than 2014 due to the advancement of our collaboration with Foundation Medicine, Inc. to develop a novel companion diagnostic test to identify patients most likely to respond to rucaparib.\nSalaries, share-based compensation expense and other personnel-related costs were $49.4 million higher in 2015, including a $15.8 million increase in share-based compensation expense, driven by increased headcount to support our expanded development and commercial planning activities. During 2015, we completed the hiring of our U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organizations in preparation for the potential commercial launch of rociletinib.\nCosts associated with non-clinical and clinical development activities for rociletinib were $35.6 million higher in 2015 than 2014 driven by increased patient enrollment in the TIGER program of studies in NSCLC. In addition, market research, disease education and other commercial product planning activities for rociletinib were $18.2 million higher in 2015 due to the preparation for the potential commercial launch of rociletinib.\nClinical supply and related manufacturing development costs for both programs were $3.2 million higher than 2014, as we increased production to support the expanded clinical studies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,731 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,524 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,457 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,207 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,067 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 over 2015 was primarily due to $3.1 million of selling expenses related to the commercialization of Rubraca, $5.3 million higher legal expense and, to a lesser extent, higher personnel costs. Pre-commercialization activities for Rubraca were included in research and development expenses.\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 over 2014 was primarily due to $3.0 million higher share-based compensation expense, $1.4 million higher facilities expense, $1.2 million higher personnel costs, $1.1 million higher legal expense and $1.0 million higher consulting fees.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses. Acquired in-process research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquired in-process research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,300 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,806 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncrease (decrease) from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(10,700) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,194 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(89.2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million to Celgene upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for rociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. During the second quarter of 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.3 million to AstraZeneca upon the NDA submission for rucaparib. During 2016, we made milestone payments totaling $1.0 million to Pfizer upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for rucaparib by the FDA and EMA, respectively.\nThe increase in acquired in-process research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was due to higher payments made to partners related to in-licensing agreements. During the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million to Celgene upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for rociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. During the first quarter of 2014, we made a $5.0 million milestone payment to Celgene upon initiation of the Phase II study for rociletinib, and we recorded a $3.4 million charge for a milestone payment to Advenchen, representing 25% of the sublicense agreement consideration of $13.6 million received from Servier upon the end of opposition and appeal of the lucitanib patent by the European Patent Office. During the second quarter of 2014, we also made a $0.4 million milestone payment to Pfizer upon initiation of a pivotal registration study for rucaparib.\nImpairment of Intangible Asset. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $104.5 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible asset relating to our lucitanib product candidate which reduced the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the product to zero. This reduction in the estimated fair value of lucitanib was the result of our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. During the\nfourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an $89.6 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible asset relating to our lucitanib product candidate. This reduction in the estimated fair value of lucitanib was the result of our and our development partner's decision to terminate the development of lucitanib for lung cancer, as well as updates to the probability-weighted discounted cash flow assumptions for the breast cancer indication. During the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a $3.4 million reduction to the intangible asset's expected future cash flows resulting from the receipt of a lucitanib milestone payment from Servier.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Purchase Consideration. Change in fair value of contingent purchase consideration was a decrease of $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a decrease of $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and an increase of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $25.5 million reduction in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liability due to our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $26.9 million reduction in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liability due to a change in the estimated probability-weighted future milestone payments, as well as the timing of such payments, for the lucitanib program.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,438) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,216) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFavorable (unfavorable) change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3,222) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,952) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFavorable (unfavorable) % Change from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(61.8) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(808.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nn/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. During 2016, we recognized $0.6 million of foreign currency losses compared with $2.7 million of gains in 2015. The change in the foreign currency gains and losses was driven by fluctuations in the foreign currency rate utilized to translate our Euro-denominated contingent purchase consideration liability into U.S. dollars.\nOther expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher interest expense related to our convertible senior notes issued in September 2014.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $28.4 million deferred tax benefit associated with the impairment of the IPR&D intangible assets recorded in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, during the first quarter 2016, we recognized a $3.6 million deferred tax benefit due to a reduction in the enacted corporate tax rate of a foreign jurisdiction in which we operate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $29.1 million deferred tax benefit primarily associated with the impairment of the IPR&D intangible assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFor the year ended 2014, we recognized income tax expense primarily due to recording foreign tax provisions during the first quarter of 2014 related to milestone revenue recognized under the Servier license agreement, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit recognized upon the reduction of the carrying value of the IPR&D intangible assets in the first quarter of 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have funded our operations through the public offering of our common stock and the private placement of convertible debt securities and preferred stock. In January 2017, we sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at $41.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were $221.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $266.2 million.\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(266,680) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(253,066) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(117,051) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n199,299 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(254,578) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,286) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,176 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n304,480 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n279,476 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(365) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(757) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(690) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(62,570) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(203,921) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n159,449 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for all periods resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital. Net cash used in operating activities increased $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 driven by an increase in payments for other accrued expenses related to the rociletinib program of non-clinical and clinical development studies, for which enrollment was completed in 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities increased $136.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 driven by higher rociletinib and rucaparib research and development costs associated with the expansion of the clinical trials, as well as the preparation for the potential commercial launch of rociletinib, and higher salaries, benefits and personnel-related costs resulting from increased headcount to support the expanded development activities and commercial planning for our product candidates. During the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million to Celgene upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for rociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we also paid $7.3 million in interest related to the convertible senior notes. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was partially offset by a $13.6 million milestone revenue payment received from Servier.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $200.0 million in sales of available-for-sale securities compared to net purchases of $251.5 million in 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $252.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale securities.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to $5.2 million received from employee stock option exercises and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $298.5 million in net proceeds received from our common stock offering in July 2015 and $6.0 million received from employee stock option exercises and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes $278.3 million in net proceeds received from our convertible senior notes offering in September 2014 and $1.2 million received from employee stock option exercises and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.\nOperating Capital Requirements\nOn December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated with advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. We expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, as we commercialize Rubraca and expand our selling, general and administrative functions to support the growth in our commercial organization. Additionally, our operating\nplan for the next 12 months includes a significant investment in inventory to meet the projected commercial requirements for Rubraca. We receive the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Rubraca from one supplier and we experience long lead times associated with its production. Accordingly, we expect to experience a decrease in our liquidity at the beginning of a production cycle and an increase as the inventory produced is sold through.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $266.2 million and total current liabilities of $65.6 million. In January 2017, we sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at $41.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were $221.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including commercial planning and sales and marketing expenses associated with the launch of Rubraca in the United States and, if approved by the EMA in Europe, funding of its development programs, selling, general and administrative expenses, acquisition or licensing of additional product candidates or businesses and working capital. Based on current estimates, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the next 12 months.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe number and characteristics of the product candidates, companion diagnostics and indications we pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones resulting in required payments to partners pursuant to the terms of our license agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates and related companion diagnostics and conducting clinical and non-clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates and companion diagnostics;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost of commercialization activities, including marketing and distribution costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe cost of manufacturing any of our product candidates we successfully commercialize;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and outcome of such litigation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales, if any, of our product candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConvertible senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n287,500 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n287,500 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on convertible senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,187 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,375 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,279 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,841 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,822 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,620 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,838 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,880 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMilestone payments (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase and other commitments (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n49,177 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51,544 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,543 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,086 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n171,350 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58,186 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n92,539 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n327,160 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n47,686 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n525,571 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Amount relates to a $20 million milestone payment, which we have exercised the option to defer payment by agreeing to pay $23 million within 18 months after the date of the FDA approval of Rubraca on December 19, 2016.\n(b)On October 3, 2016, we entered into a Manufacturing and Services Agreement (the Agreement\u201d) with a non-exclusive third-party supplier for the production of the active ingredient for rucaparib. Under the terms of the Agreement, we will provide the third-party supplier a rolling forecast for the supply of the active ingredient in rucaparib that will be updated by us on a quarterly basis. We are obligated to order material sufficient to satisfy an initial quantity specified in any forecast. In addition, the third-party supplier will construct, in its existing facility, a production train that will be exclusively dedicated to the manufacture of the rucaparib active ingredient. We are obligated to make scheduled capital program fee payments toward capital equipment and other costs associated with the construction of the dedicated production train. Further, once the facility is operational, we are obligated to pay a\nfixed facility fee each quarter for the duration of the Agreement, which expires on December 31, 2025, unless extended by mutual consent of the parties.\nRoyalty and License Fee Commitments\nWe have certain obligations under licensing agreements with third parties contingent upon achieving various development, regulatory and commercial milestones. On August 30, 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the worldwide license agreement with Pfizer, which amends the June 2011 existing worldwide license agreement to permit us to defer payment of the milestone payments payable upon (i) FDA approval of an NDA for 1st Indication in US and (ii) EMA approval of an MAA for 1st Indication in EU, to a date that is 18 months after the date of achievement of such milestones. In the event that we defer such milestone payments, we have agreed to certain higher payments related to the achievement of such milestones.\nOn December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated with advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. The FDA approval resulted in a $0.75 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. The FDA approval also resulted in the obligation to pay a $20.0 million milestone payment, in which we have exercised the option to defer payment by agreeing to pay $23.0 million within 18 months after the date of the FDA approval. These payments were recognized as intangible assets and will be amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib.\nPursuant to our license agreements for the development of rucaparib, we are required to make regulatory milestone payments up to an additional $69.75 million in aggregate if specified clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are obligated to make sales milestone payments if specified annual sales targets for rucaparib are met, the majority of which relate to annual sales targets of $500.0 million and above, which, in aggregate, could amount to total milestone payments of $170.0 million, and tiered royalty payments at a mid-teen percentage rate on our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize rucaparib.\nWe are obligated to pay additional consideration to the former EOS shareholders if certain future regulatory and lucitanib-related sales milestones are achieved. The estimated fair value of these payments was recorded as contingent purchase consideration on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The potential contingent milestone payments range from a zero payment, which assumes lucitanib fails to achieve any of the regulatory milestones, to $186.0 million ($65.0 million and \u20ac115.0 million) if all regulatory and sales milestones are met, utilizing the translation rate at December 31, 2016. The estimated fair value of the liability was zero at December 31, 2016 due to the uncertainty of achieving any of the lucitanib regulatory milestones, and therefore the remote likelihood of future milestone payout amounts to the former EOS shareholders. We are also obligated to pay to Advenchen 25% of any consideration, excluding royalties, received pursuant to any sublicense agreements for lucitanib, including the agreement with Servier.\nPursuant to our license agreement for the development and commercialization of rociletinib, we may be required to pay up to an additional aggregate of $98.0 million in regulatory milestone payments if certain clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptance and approvals are achieved. Further, we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of $120.0 million in sales milestone payments if certain annual sales targets are met for rociletinib.\nFinally, pursuant to terms of each of our product license agreements, we will pay royalties to our licensors on sales, if any, of the respective products.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTax Loss Carryforwards\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $711.8 million to offset future federal income taxes. We also have research and development and orphan drug tax credit carryforwards of\n$240.7 million to offset future federal income taxes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development and orphan drug tax credit carryforwards expire at various times through 2036.\nWe believe that a change in ownership as defined under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code occurred as a result of our public offering of common stock completed in April 2012. Future utilization of the federal net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards accumulated from inception to the change in ownership date will be subject to annual limitations to offset future taxable income. At this time, we do not believe this limitation will prevent the utilization of the federal NOL or credit carryforward prior to expiration. It is possible that a change in ownership will occur in the future, which will limit the NOL amounts generated since the last estimated change in ownership. At December 31, 2016, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. of approximately $588.8 million and a $3.6 million valuation allowance against tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, as we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be fully realized. In the future, if we determine that a portion or all of the tax benefits associated with our tax carryforwards will be realized, net income would increase in the period of determination.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures when certain criteria are met. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning in 2016 and interim reporting periods starting in the first quarter of 2017. Early application is permitted. We adopted this standard effective December 31, 2016. Adoption of the standard resulted in no change to our disclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and has subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASUs (collectively, ASC 606\u201d). ASC 606 prescribes a single common revenue standard that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 is intended to provide a more consistent interpretation and application of the principles outlined in the standard across filers in multiple industries and within the same industries compared to current practices, which should improve comparability. Adoption of ASC 606 is required for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Upon adoption, we must elect to adopt either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or use the cumulative effect transition method with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized at the date of initial application. We began recognizing revenue from product sales for the first time after the FDA approval of Rubraca on December 19, 2016 and have adopted a revenue recognition policy accordingly. We have not determined what adoption transition method we will use. We are currently assessing the impact that the future adoption of ASC 606 may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures by analyzing our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences in applying the guidance of ASC 606.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, which amends existing guidance for measurement of inventory. Current inventory guidance requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. An entity should measure all inventory to which the amendments apply at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d, to simplify financial reporting of the income tax impacts of share-based compensation arrangements. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning after January 1, 2017. The classification guidance under ASU No. 2016-09 requires the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation arrangements as a discrete item within income tax benefit rather than additional paid-in capital and the classification guidance requiring presentation of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation arrangements as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows, rather than as an operating activity.\nThe adoption of ASU No 2016-09 is expected to have no immediate impact on our financial statements and related disclosures because we do not currently recognize a tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense as we maintain net operating loss carryforwards and have established a valuation allowance against the entire net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2016. Further, we have elected to continue to estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, as permitted by ASU 2016-09, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as the occur.", "summary": "The report provides a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of a biopharmaceutical company. The company is focused on developing anti-cancer agents and has a commercial product called Rubraca, targeting patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The report details the company's financial history, including a summary of revenue, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other income and expenses.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents in the United States, Europe and additional international markets. We target our development programs for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations, and simultaneously develop, with partners, diagnostic tools intended to direct a compound in development to the population that is most likely to benefit from its use.\nOur commercial product Rubraca (rucaparib) is the first and only oral, small molecule poly ADP-ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 approved in the United States by the FDA as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA (human genes associated with the repair of damaged DNA) mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.\nThe MAA submission with the EMA for a comparable ovarian cancer indication was accepted by the EMA during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, rucaparib is being studied as a potential maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer patients in the ARIEL3 trial. Data from ARIEL3 is anticipated in mid-2017. Pending positive data from ARIEL3, we intend to follow up with a supplemental NDA for second-line maintenance therapy in women with ovarian cancer who have responded to platinum-based therapy. Rucaparib is also being developed in patients with mutant BRCA tumors and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA - commonly referred to as homologous recombination deficiencies. Studies open for enrollment or under consideration include prostate, breast, pancreatic, gastroesophageal, bladder and lung cancers. We hold worldwide rights for rucaparib.\nIn addition, we have two other product candidates: lucitanib, an oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) alpha and beta and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1-3, and rociletinib, an oral mutant-selective inhibitor of EGFR. Clinical development for each of these candidates has ceased and we continue to provide drug to patients whose clinicians recommend continuing therapy. We maintain certain development and commercialization rights for lucitanib and global development and commercialization rights for rociletinib.\nWe commenced operations in April 2009. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to identifying and in-licensing product candidates, performing development activities with respect to those product candidates and the general and administrative support of these operations. Through December 31, 2016, we have generated $13.6 million in license and milestone revenue related to our collaboration and license agreement with Servier and have generated $0.1 million product revenue related to sales of Rubraca, which we began to commercialize on December 19, 2016. We have principally funded our operations using the net proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, public offerings of our common stock and our convertible senior notes offering.\nWe have never been profitable and, as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,131.0 million. We incurred net losses of $349.1 million, $352.9 million and $160.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $266.2 million at December 31, 2016.\nWe expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, as we incur costs related to commercial activities associated with Rubraca. In January 2017, we sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at $41.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were $221.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding commercial planning and sales and marketing expenses associated with the launch of Rubraca in the United States and, if approved by the EMA, in Europe, funding of our development programs, selling, general and administrative expenses, acquisition or licensing of additional product candidates or businesses and working capital. Based on our current estimates, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities will allow us to fund activities through at least the next 12 months. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from Rubraca, we expect to finance our operations in part through additional public or private equity or debt offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nProduct License Agreements\nRucaparib\nIn June 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer Inc. to acquire exclusive global development and commercialization rights to rucaparib. The exclusive rights are exclusive even as to Pfizer and include the right to grant sublicenses. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made a $7.0 million upfront payment to Pfizer. In April 2014, we initiated a pivotal registration study for rucaparib, which resulted in a $0.4 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. In September 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.5 million to Pfizer upon acceptance of the NDA for rucaparib by the FDA. The MAA submission with the EMA for a comparable ovarian cancer indication was completed and accepted by the MAA during the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a $0.5 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. These payments were recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense.\nOn August 30, 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the worldwide license agreement with Pfizer, which amends the June 2011 existing worldwide license agreement to permit us to defer payment of the milestone payments payable upon (i) FDA approval of an NDA for 1st Indication in US and (ii) EMA approval of an MAA for 1st Indication in EU, to a date that is 18 months after the date of achievement of such milestones. In the event that we defer such milestone payments, we have agreed to certain higher payments related to the achievement of such milestones.\nOn December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated with advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. The FDA approval resulted in a $0.75 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. The FDA approval also resulted in the obligation to pay a $20.0 million milestone payment, for which we have exercised the option to defer payment by agreeing to pay $23.0 million within 18 months after the date of the FDA approval. These payments were recognized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib.\nWe are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize rucaparib and we are responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for rucaparib. We are required to make regulatory milestone payments to Pfizer of up to an additional $69.75 million in aggregate if specified clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are obligated to make sales milestone payments to Pfizer if specified annual sales targets for rucaparib are met, the majority of which relate to annual sales targets of $500.0 million and above, which, in the aggregate, could amount to total milestone payments of $170.0 million, and tiered royalty payments at a mid-teen percentage rate on our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize rucaparib.\nThe license agreement with Pfizer will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Pfizer, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Pfizer can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to rucaparib and an obligation to assign or license to Pfizer any intellectual property rights or other rights we may have in rucaparib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for rucaparib.\nIn April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited to acquire exclusive rights associated with rucaparib under a family of patents and patent applications that claim methods of treating patients with\nPARP inhibitors in certain indications. The license enables the development and commercialization of rucaparib for the uses claimed by these patents. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made an upfront payment of $0.25 million upon execution of the agreement. During the second quarter of 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.3 million to AstraZeneca upon the NDA submission for rucaparib. These payments were recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense. The FDA approval of rucaparib on December 19, 2016 resulted in a $0.35 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca as required by the license agreement. This payment was recognized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib. AstraZeneca will also receive royalties on any net sales of rucaparib.\nLucitanib\nIn October 2008, EOS (now known as Clovis Oncology Italy S.r.l.) entered into an exclusive license agreement with Advenchen to develop and commercialize lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China. We are obligated to pay Advenchen tiered royalties at percentage rates in the mid-single digits on net sales of lucitanib, based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. In addition, after giving effect to the first and second amendments to the license agreement, we are required to pay to Advenchen 25% of any consideration, excluding royalties, we receive from sublicensees, in lieu of the milestone obligations set forth in the agreement. We are obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product containing lucitanib, and we are also responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for lucitanib. In the first quarter of 2014, we recognized acquired in-process research and development expense of $3.4 million, which represents 25% of the sublicense agreement consideration of $13.6 million received from Servier upon the end of opposition and appeal of the lucitanib patent by the European Patent Office.\nThe license agreement with Advenchen will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations to Advenchen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Advenchen can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to lucitanib.\nIn September 2012, EOS entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Servier whereby EOS sublicensed to Servier exclusive rights to develop and commercialize lucitanib in all countries outside of the U.S., Japan and China. In exchange for these rights, EOS received an upfront payment of \u20ac45.0 million. We are entitled to receive additional payments upon achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to \u20ac100.0 million in the aggregate, \u20ac10.0 million of which was received in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, we are entitled to receive sales milestone payments if specified annual sales targets for lucitanib are met, which, in the aggregate, could total \u20ac250.0 million. We are also entitled to receive royalties on sales of lucitanib by Servier.\nWe and Servier are developing lucitanib pursuant to a development plan agreed to between the parties. Servier is responsible for all of the global development costs for lucitanib up to \u20ac80.0 million. Cumulative global development costs in excess of \u20ac80.0 million, if any, will be shared equally between us and Servier. During the second quarter of 2016, we and Servier agreed to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer and lung cancer and are continuing to evaluate what, if any, further development of lucitanib will be pursued. Based on current estimates, we expect to complete the committed on-going development activities in 2017 and expect full reimbursement of our development costs from Servier. Reimbursements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRociletinib\nIn May 2010, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Celgene to discover, develop and commercialize a covalent inhibitor of mutant forms of the EGFR gene product. Rociletinib was identified as the lead inhibitor candidate under the license agreement. We are responsible for all non-clinical, clinical, regulatory and other activities necessary to develop and commercialize rociletinib.\nWe made an upfront payment of $2.0 million upon execution of the license agreement, a $4.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2012 upon the acceptance by the FDA of our IND application for rociletinib and a $5.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2014 upon the initiation of the Phase II study for rociletinib. In the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for\nrociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. We recognized all payments prior to commercial approval as acquired in-process research and development expense.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we received a CRL from the FDA for the rociletinib NDA. The FDA issues a CRL to indicate that their review of an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. In anticipation of receiving the CRL, we terminated enrollment in all ongoing sponsored clinical studies, although we continue to provide drug to patients whose clinicians recommend continuing rociletinib therapy. In addition, we withdrew our MAA for rociletinib on file with the EMA. We are continuing analyses of rociletinib data to determine whether certain populations of patients may represent an opportunity for a partner committed to investing in further clinical development.\nWe are obligated to pay royalties at percentage rates ranging from mid-single digits to low-teens based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. We are required to pay up to an additional aggregate of $98.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments if certain clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are required to pay up to an aggregate of $120.0 million in sales milestone payments if certain annual sales targets are achieved.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have generated $13.6 million in license and milestone revenue related to our collaboration and license agreement with Servier. During December 2016, we recorded $0.1 million revenue related to sales of Rubraca, which we began to commercialize on December 19, 2016. For further discussion of our revenue recognition policy, see Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\u201d below. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize products. Any inability on our part to successfully commercialize Rubraca in the United States and any foreign territories where it may be approved, or any significant delay in such approvals, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy and, ultimately, to generate sufficient revenues from Rubraca to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates and companion diagnostics, which include:\n \u00b7 license fees and milestone payments related to the acquisition of in-licensed products, which are reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as acquired in-process research and development; \n \u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations ( CROs\u201d) and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials; \n \u00b7 the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; \n \u00b7 costs associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory operations; \n \u00b7 market research, disease education and other commercial product planning activities, including the hiring of a U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organization in preparation for commercial launch of rucaparib; and \n \u00b7 activities associated with the development of companion diagnostics for our product candidates. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. License fees and milestone payments related to in-licensed products and technology are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical supply, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. As a result of the FDA approval of Rubraca and the discontinuation of enrollment in rociletinib, our research and development expenses will decrease for 2017 as we continue to commercialize Rubraca and commercialization related expenses are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses and not research and development costs.\nThe following table identifies research and development and acquired in-process research and development costs on a program-specific basis for our products under development. Personnel-related costs, depreciation and share-based compensation are not allocated to specific programs, as they are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, are separately classified as personnel and other expenses in the table below.\n\n(a)This amount reflects actual costs incurred less amounts due from Servier for reimbursable development expenses pursuant to the collaboration and license agreement described in Note 11, License Agreements, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses increased significantly from 2014 through 2015 due to the expansion of our clinical development activities for rociletinib and rucaparib. In addition, during 2015, we increased commercial product planning activities in anticipation of the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch in the U.S. of rociletinib. These activities included the hiring of our U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organizations. For 2016, research and development expenses decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to decreased development activities for the rociletinib program, partially offset by higher expenses related to the rucaparib program.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, legal, investor relations, human resources and information technology functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facilities expenses, communication expenses, information technology costs, corporate insurance and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. With the FDA approval of Rubraca on December 19, 2016, all sales and marketing expenses associated with Rubraca are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nEffective May 9, 2016, at Mr. Mahaffy's request, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved his waiver of any annual base salary in excess of $1.00, plus the cost of the employee portion of any premiums to be paid pursuant to any health and welfare benefit plans maintained by us and any tax withholdings related to health and welfare benefits. Such waiver continued in effect until the earliest to occur of (i) the Company entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction that if consummated would constitute a Change in Control (as defined in his Employment Agreement) or the public announcement of a proposal or transaction that if consummated would constitute a Change of Control, (ii) approval by the FDA to commercially distribute, sell or market rucaparib, and (iii) termination of his employment by the Company without Just Cause or by Mr. Mahaffy for Good Reason (each as defined in his Employment Agreement). On December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca resulting in the discontinuation of Mr. Mahaffy's waiver.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses consist of upfront payments to acquire a new drug compound, as well as subsequent milestone payments. Acquired in-process research and development payments are immediately expensed provided that the drug has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and, absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use. Once regulatory approval is received, payments to acquire rights, and the related milestone payments, are capitalized and the amortization of such assets recorded to product cost of sales.\nImpairment of Intangible Asset\nIn connection with the acquisition of EOS in November 2013, we recorded intangible assets to reflect the fair value of acquired in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d) as of the acquisition date. The fair value was established based upon discounted cash flow models using assumptions related to the timing of development, probability of development and regulatory success, sales and commercialization factors and estimated product life. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $104.5 million impairment charge due to our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the IPR&D intangible asset recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was zero. Previously, the Company recorded an $89.6 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Purchase Consideration\nIn connection with the acquisition of EOS in November 2013, we also recorded a purchase consideration liability equal to the estimated fair value of future payments that are contingent upon the achievement of various regulatory and sales milestones. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we re-measure contingent consideration arrangements at fair value each reporting period and record changes in fair value to change in fair value of contingent purchase consideration and foreign currency gains (losses) for changes in the foreign currency translation rate on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in fair value are primarily attributed to new information about the likelihood of achieving such milestones and the passage of time. In the absence of new information, changes to fair value reflect only the passage of time as we progress towards the achievement of future milestones. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $25.5 million reduction in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liability due to our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the contingent purchase consideration liability recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets remained at zero due to the uncertainty of achieving any of the lucitanib regulatory milestones, and therefore the remote likelihood of future milestone payout amounts to the former EOS shareholders.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions with CROs, investigational sites and contract manufacturers where payments are made in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, a significant portion of the contingent purchase consideration liability will be settled in Euro-denominated payments if certain future milestones are achieved and is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Other expense also includes interest expense recognized related to our convertible senior notes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and revenue and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to contingent purchase consideration, the allocation of purchase consideration, intangible asset impairment, clinical trial accruals and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include:\n \u00b7 fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 fees paid to vendors in connection with non-clinical development activities; \n \u00b7 fees paid to vendors associated with the development of companion diagnostics; and \n \u00b7 fees paid to vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies. \nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Based on the amount of accrued research and development expenses as of December 31, 2016, if our estimates of our net accrued liabilities are too high or too low by 5%, this could increase or decrease our research and development expenses by approximately $1.8 million.\nShare-Based Compensation\nDetermining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the expected", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents in the United States, Europe and additional international markets. We target our development programs for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations, and simultaneously develop, with partners, diagnostic tools intended to direct a compound in development to the population that is most likely to benefit from its use.\nOur commercial product Rubraca (rucaparib) is the first and only oral, small molecule poly ADP-ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 approved in the United States by the FDA as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA (human genes associated with the repair of damaged DNA) mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.\nThe MAA submission with the EMA for a comparable ovarian cancer indication was accepted by the EMA during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, rucaparib is being studied as a potential maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer patients in the ARIEL3 trial. Data from ARIEL3 is anticipated in mid-2017. Pending positive data from ARIEL3, we intend to follow up with a supplemental NDA for second-line maintenance therapy in women with ovarian cancer who have responded to platinum-based therapy. Rucaparib is also being developed in patients with mutant BRCA tumors and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA - commonly referred to as homologous recombination deficiencies. Studies open for enrollment or under consideration include prostate, breast, pancreatic, gastroesophageal, bladder and lung cancers. We hold worldwide rights for rucaparib.\nIn addition, we have two other product candidates: lucitanib, an oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) alpha and beta and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1-3, and rociletinib, an oral mutant-selective inhibitor of EGFR. Clinical development for each of these candidates has ceased and we continue to provide drug to patients whose clinicians recommend continuing therapy. We maintain certain development and commercialization rights for lucitanib and global development and commercialization rights for rociletinib.\nWe commenced operations in April 2009. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to identifying and in-licensing product candidates, performing development activities with respect to those product candidates and the general and administrative support of these operations. Through December 31, 2016, we have generated $13.6 million in license and milestone revenue related to our collaboration and license agreement with Servier and have generated $0.1 million product revenue related to sales of Rubraca, which we began to commercialize on December 19, 2016. We have principally funded our operations using the net proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, public offerings of our common stock and our convertible senior notes offering.\nWe have never been profitable and, as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,131.0 million. We incurred net losses of $349.1 million, $352.9 million and $160.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $266.2 million at December 31, 2016.\nWe expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, as we incur costs related to commercial activities associated with Rubraca. In January 2017, we sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at $41.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were $221.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes,\nincluding commercial planning and sales and marketing expenses associated with the launch of Rubraca in the United States and, if approved by the EMA, in Europe, funding of our development programs, selling, general and administrative expenses, acquisition or licensing of additional product candidates or businesses and working capital. Based on our current estimates, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities will allow us to fund activities through at least the next 12 months. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from Rubraca, we expect to finance our operations in part through additional public or private equity or debt offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nProduct License Agreements\nRucaparib\nIn June 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer Inc. to acquire exclusive global development and commercialization rights to rucaparib. The exclusive rights are exclusive even as to Pfizer and include the right to grant sublicenses. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made a $7.0 million upfront payment to Pfizer. In April 2014, we initiated a pivotal registration study for rucaparib, which resulted in a $0.4 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. In September 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.5 million to Pfizer upon acceptance of the NDA for rucaparib by the FDA. The MAA submission with the EMA for a comparable ovarian cancer indication was completed and accepted by the MAA during the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a $0.5 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. These payments were recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense.\nOn August 30, 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the worldwide license agreement with Pfizer, which amends the June 2011 existing worldwide license agreement to permit us to defer payment of the milestone payments payable upon (i) FDA approval of an NDA for 1st Indication in US and (ii) EMA approval of an MAA for 1st Indication in EU, to a date that is 18 months after the date of achievement of such milestones. In the event that we defer such milestone payments, we have agreed to certain higher payments related to the achievement of such milestones.\nOn December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated with advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. The FDA approval resulted in a $0.75 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. The FDA approval also resulted in the obligation to pay a $20.0 million milestone payment, for which we have exercised the option to defer payment by agreeing to pay $23.0 million within 18 months after the date of the FDA approval. These payments were recognized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib.\nWe are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize rucaparib and we are responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for rucaparib. We are required to make regulatory milestone payments to Pfizer of up to an additional $69.75 million in aggregate if specified clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are obligated to make sales milestone payments to Pfizer if specified annual sales targets for rucaparib are met, the majority of which relate to annual sales targets of $500.0 million and above, which, in the aggregate, could amount to total milestone payments of $170.0 million, and tiered royalty payments at a mid-teen percentage rate on our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize rucaparib.\nThe license agreement with Pfizer will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Pfizer, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Pfizer can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to rucaparib and an obligation to assign or license to Pfizer any intellectual property rights or other rights we may have in rucaparib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for rucaparib.\nIn April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited to acquire exclusive rights associated with rucaparib under a family of patents and patent applications that claim methods of treating patients with\nPARP inhibitors in certain indications. The license enables the development and commercialization of rucaparib for the uses claimed by these patents. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made an upfront payment of $0.25 million upon execution of the agreement. During the second quarter of 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.3 million to AstraZeneca upon the NDA submission for rucaparib. These payments were recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense. The FDA approval of rucaparib on December 19, 2016 resulted in a $0.35 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca as required by the license agreement. This payment was recognized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib. AstraZeneca will also receive royalties on any net sales of rucaparib.\nLucitanib\nIn October 2008, EOS (now known as Clovis Oncology Italy S.r.l.) entered into an exclusive license agreement with Advenchen to develop and commercialize lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China. We are obligated to pay Advenchen tiered royalties at percentage rates in the mid-single digits on net sales of lucitanib, based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. In addition, after giving effect to the first and second amendments to the license agreement, we are required to pay to Advenchen 25% of any consideration, excluding royalties, we receive from sublicensees, in lieu of the milestone obligations set forth in the agreement. We are obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product containing lucitanib, and we are also responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for lucitanib. In the first quarter of 2014, we recognized acquired in-process research and development expense of $3.4 million, which represents 25% of the sublicense agreement consideration of $13.6 million received from Servier upon the end of opposition and appeal of the lucitanib patent by the European Patent Office.\nThe license agreement with Advenchen will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations to Advenchen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Advenchen can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to lucitanib.\nIn September 2012, EOS entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Servier whereby EOS sublicensed to Servier exclusive rights to develop and commercialize lucitanib in all countries outside of the U.S., Japan and China. In exchange for these rights, EOS received an upfront payment of \u20ac45.0 million. We are entitled to receive additional payments upon achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to \u20ac100.0 million in the aggregate, \u20ac10.0 million of which was received in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, we are entitled to receive sales milestone payments if specified annual sales targets for lucitanib are met, which, in the aggregate, could total \u20ac250.0 million. We are also entitled to receive royalties on sales of lucitanib by Servier.\nWe and Servier are developing lucitanib pursuant to a development plan agreed to between the parties. Servier is responsible for all of the global development costs for lucitanib up to \u20ac80.0 million. Cumulative global development costs in excess of \u20ac80.0 million, if any, will be shared equally between us and Servier. During the second quarter of 2016, we and Servier agreed to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer and lung cancer and are continuing to evaluate what, if any, further development of lucitanib will be pursued. Based on current estimates, we expect to complete the committed on-going development activities in 2017 and expect full reimbursement of our development costs from Servier. Reimbursements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRociletinib\nIn May 2010, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Celgene to discover, develop and commercialize a covalent inhibitor of mutant forms of the EGFR gene product. Rociletinib was identified as the lead inhibitor candidate under the license agreement. We are responsible for all non-clinical, clinical, regulatory and other activities necessary to develop and commercialize rociletinib.\nWe made an upfront payment of $2.0 million upon execution of the license agreement, a $4.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2012 upon the acceptance by the FDA of our IND application for rociletinib and a $5.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2014 upon the initiation of the Phase II study for rociletinib. In the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for\nrociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. We recognized all payments prior to commercial approval as acquired in-process research and development expense.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we received a CRL from the FDA for the rociletinib NDA. The FDA issues a CRL to indicate that their review of an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. In anticipation of receiving the CRL, we terminated enrollment in all ongoing sponsored clinical studies, although we continue to provide drug to patients whose clinicians recommend continuing rociletinib therapy. In addition, we withdrew our MAA for rociletinib on file with the EMA. We are continuing analyses of rociletinib data to determine whether certain populations of patients may represent an opportunity for a partner committed to investing in further clinical development.\nWe are obligated to pay royalties at percentage rates ranging from mid-single digits to low-teens based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. We are required to pay up to an additional aggregate of $98.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments if certain clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are required to pay up to an aggregate of $120.0 million in sales milestone payments if certain annual sales targets are achieved.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have generated $13.6 million in license and milestone revenue related to our collaboration and license agreement with Servier. During December 2016, we recorded $0.1 million revenue related to sales of Rubraca, which we began to commercialize on December 19, 2016. For further discussion of our revenue recognition policy, see Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\u201d below. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize products. Any inability on our part to successfully commercialize Rubraca in the United States and any foreign territories where it may be approved, or any significant delay in such approvals, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy and, ultimately, to generate sufficient revenues from Rubraca to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates and companion diagnostics, which include:\n \u00b7 license fees and milestone payments related to the acquisition of in-licensed products, which are reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as acquired in-process research and development; \n \u00b7 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations ( CROs\u201d) and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials; \n \u00b7 the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; \n \u00b7 costs associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory operations; \n \u00b7 market research, disease education and other commercial product planning activities, including the hiring of a U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organization in preparation for commercial launch of rucaparib; and \n \u00b7 activities associated with the development of companion diagnostics for our product candidates. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. License fees and milestone payments related to in-licensed products and technology are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical supply, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. As a result of the FDA approval of Rubraca and the discontinuation of enrollment in rociletinib, our research and development expenses will decrease for 2017 as we continue to commercialize Rubraca and commercialization related expenses are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses and not research and development costs.\nThe following table identifies research and development and acquired in-process research and development costs on a program-specific basis for our products under development. Personnel-related costs, depreciation and share-based compensation are not allocated to specific programs, as they are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, are separately classified as personnel and other expenses in the table below.\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRucaparib Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n101,598 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58,922 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,010 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquired in-process R&D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,300 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRucaparib Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n102,898 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,922 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,410 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLucitanib Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,337) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,923 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(491) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquired in-process R&D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,406 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLucitanib Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,337) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,923 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,915 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRociletinib Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,768 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n122,912 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n69,920 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquired in-process R&D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,000 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRociletinib Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43,768 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n134,912 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n74,920 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPersonnel and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n107,100 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n85,494 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,266 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n252,429 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n281,251 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n146,511 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)This amount reflects actual costs incurred less amounts due from Servier for reimbursable development expenses pursuant to the collaboration and license agreement described in Note 11, License Agreements, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses increased significantly from 2014 through 2015 due to the expansion of our clinical development activities for rociletinib and rucaparib. In addition, during 2015, we increased commercial product planning activities in anticipation of the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch in the U.S. of rociletinib. These activities included the hiring of our U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organizations. For 2016, research and development expenses decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to decreased development activities for the rociletinib program, partially offset by higher expenses related to the rucaparib program.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, legal, investor relations, human resources and information technology functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facilities expenses, communication expenses, information technology costs, corporate insurance and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. With the FDA approval of Rubraca on December 19, 2016, all sales and marketing expenses associated with Rubraca are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nEffective May 9, 2016, at Mr. Mahaffy's request, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved his waiver of any annual base salary in excess of $1.00, plus the cost of the employee portion of any premiums to be paid pursuant to any health and welfare benefit plans maintained by us and any tax withholdings related to health and welfare benefits. Such waiver continued in effect until the earliest to occur of (i) the Company entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction that if consummated would constitute a Change in Control (as defined in his Employment Agreement) or the public announcement of a proposal or transaction that if consummated would constitute a Change of Control, (ii) approval by the FDA to commercially distribute, sell or market rucaparib, and (iii) termination of his employment by the Company without Just Cause or by Mr. Mahaffy for Good Reason (each as defined in his Employment Agreement). On December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca resulting in the discontinuation of Mr. Mahaffy's waiver.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses consist of upfront payments to acquire a new drug compound, as well as subsequent milestone payments. Acquired in-process research and development payments are immediately expensed provided that the drug has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and, absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use. Once regulatory approval is received, payments to acquire rights, and the related milestone payments, are capitalized and the amortization of such assets recorded to product cost of sales.\nImpairment of Intangible Asset\nIn connection with the acquisition of EOS in November 2013, we recorded intangible assets to reflect the fair value of acquired in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d) as of the acquisition date. The fair value was established based upon discounted cash flow models using assumptions related to the timing of development, probability of development and regulatory success, sales and commercialization factors and estimated product life. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $104.5 million impairment charge due to our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the IPR&D intangible asset recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was zero. Previously, the Company recorded an $89.6 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Purchase Consideration\nIn connection with the acquisition of EOS in November 2013, we also recorded a purchase consideration liability equal to the estimated fair value of future payments that are contingent upon the achievement of various regulatory and sales milestones. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we re-measure contingent consideration arrangements at fair value each reporting period and record changes in fair value to change in fair value of contingent purchase consideration and foreign currency gains (losses) for changes in the foreign currency translation rate on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in fair value are primarily attributed to new information about the likelihood of achieving such milestones and the passage of time. In the absence of new information, changes to fair value reflect only the passage of time as we progress towards the achievement of future milestones. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $25.5 million reduction in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liability due to our and our development partner's decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the contingent purchase consideration liability recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets remained at zero due to the uncertainty of achieving any of the lucitanib regulatory milestones, and therefore the remote likelihood of future milestone payout amounts to the former EOS shareholders.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions with CROs, investigational sites and contract manufacturers where payments are made in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, a significant portion of the contingent purchase consideration liability will be settled in Euro-denominated payments if certain future milestones are achieved and is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Other expense also includes interest expense recognized related to our convertible senior notes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and revenue and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to contingent purchase consideration, the allocation of purchase consideration, intangible asset impairment, clinical trial accruals and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include:\n \u00b7 fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 fees paid to vendors in connection with non-clinical development activities; \n \u00b7 fees paid to vendors associated with the development of companion diagnostics; and \n \u00b7 fees paid to vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies. \nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Based on the amount of accrued research and development expenses as of December 31, 2016, if our estimates of our net accrued liabilities are too high or too low by 5%, this could increase or decrease our research and development expenses by approximately $1.8 million.\nShare-Based Compensation\nDetermining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the expected"}
