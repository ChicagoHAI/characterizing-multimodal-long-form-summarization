In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nThe following discussion pertains to our historical results, on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our subsidiaries, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when specifically identified.\nOur Business\nWe (the Company\u201d or NCC\u201d) are a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. We operate one subsidiary bank, National Bank of Commerce ( NBC\u201d). During 2014, we acquired United Group Banking Company of Florida, Inc. ( United\u201d) and on February 28, 2015, merged its banking subsidiary, United Legacy Bank ( ULB\u201d) with and into NBC. NBC now operates the former ULB locations under the trade name United Legacy Bank, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d On October 31, 2015, we acquired Reunion Bank of Florida ( Reunion\u201d) through a merger of Reunion with and into NBC. NBC now operates each of the former Reunion locations under the trade name Reunion Bank of Florida, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d\nThrough NBC, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners and professionals through seven full-service banking offices in Alabama (Birmingham, Huntsville, Auburn-Opelika, and Baldwin County) and ten full-service banking offices in Florida (Longwood, Winter Park, Orlando, Oviedo, Tavares, Port Orange, Ormond Beach, St. Augustine and Vero Beach). In addition to the full-service banking offices, we operate two loan production offices in Florida, located in Osceola and Orange Counties. We also own a 70% equity interest in CBI Holding Company, LLC ( CBI\u201d), which owns Corporate Billing, a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers throughout the United States and Canada.\n2015 Acquisition\nReunion Bank of Florida\nOn October 31, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Reunion, a Florida bank headquartered in Tavares, Florida. At that time, Reunion was merged with and into NBC, and NBC now operates in the markets formerly served by Reunion under the trade name Reunion Bank of Florida, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d Reunion had a total of four full-service banking locations and two loan production offices located in five counties in central and northeast Florida.\nReunion's common shareholders were entitled to receive either 0.7273 shares of NCC's common stock, $16.00 in cash, or a combination of stock and cash in exchange for each share of Reunion common stock, subject to certain allocation limitations and proration procedures set forth in the merger agreement. Specifically, 80% of the shares of Reunion common stock, or 1,841,418 shares, were converted into newly issued shares of NCC common stock, and the remaining 20%, or 460,355 shares, were converted into the right to receive cash. We paid cash for cash elections and in lieu of fractional shares totaling $7,368,809 and issued 1,339,129 shares of our common stock in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $43.2 million. We recorded $20.6 million of goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset of $1.5 million.\nWe marked Reunion's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of the acquisition, and these fair value adjustments are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date as additional information becomes available. We acquired approximately $309.7 million in assets at fair value from Reunion and added approximately $258.4 million in loans and approximately $277.7 million in deposits.\n2014 Acquisitions\nCBI Holding Company, LLC\nOn August 29, 2014, NBC acquired 70% of the outstanding units of CBI, which owns Corporate Billing, a receivables factoring business headquartered in Decatur, Alabama. CBI now operates as a subsidiary of NBC. We have an option to purchase the remaining 30% interest for a price based on a multiple of CBI's earnings that is exercisable at any time beginning on August 29, 2019 and expires on August 29, 2022. NBC paid $16.2 million in cash for its 70% interest in CBI. Our consolidated financial statements include all of the assets and liabilities of CBI, as well as a minority interest, representing the 30% that we have not purchased. As a result, at acquisition, we recorded $23.1 million of goodwill and a non-controlling interest of $6.9 million.\nWe marked the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to fair value based on information available at the time of the acquisition. Given an average life for CBI's receivables of 35 to 40 days, the assets and liabilities of CBI are very short-term in nature, and the book value was deemed to be the fair value, with the exception of a $174 thousand discount on the purchased factored receivables, which was accreted into income during September 2014 in accordance with the average life of the related receivables.\nUnited Group Banking Company of Florida, Inc.\nOn December 15, 2014, we completed our acquisition of United, a bank holding company headquartered in Longwood, Florida. United's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, ULB, merged with and into NBC on February 28, 2015. Since the merger, NBC has operated in the Orlando, Florida market under the trade name United Legacy Bank, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d\nAt the time of the acquisition, United was merged with and into NCC, with NCC as the surviving entity in the merger. United's common shareholders received either 0.057794 shares of our common stock, $1.30 in cash, or a combination of stock and cash in exchange for each share of United common stock. The total amount of cash that we paid was capped at $2,950,000 by the merger agreement (excluding any cash to be paid for fractional shares). We paid cash for cash elections and in lieu of fractional shares totaling $2,953,884 and issued 1,617,027 shares of our common stock. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $33.3 million. We recorded $5.7 million of goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset of $1.8 million.\nWe marked United's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $233.2 million in assets at fair value from United and added six banking centers (one of which we subsequently closed) with approximately $149.9 million in loans and approximately $200.5 million in deposits.\nAdditional information regarding the CBI acquisition and the Reunion and United mergers is included in Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\nOverview of 2015 Results\nOur net income was $9.6 million in 2015, compared with $5.4 million in 2014. The primary factors leading to the increase in the 2015 net income and other highlights include the following:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Average loans outstanding in 2015 were $1.01 billion, approximately 60.9% higher than the $629.0 million in average loans outstanding in 2014. The higher loan balance led to an increase in net interest income from $28.5 million in 2014 to $50.0 million in 2015. In addition to organic growth, 2015 balances include a full year of loans attributable to CBI and United.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Loan yields in 2015 averaged 5.17%, compared to 4.68% for 2014, and interest-bearing liability costs of 0.55% in 2015 were 0.04% higher than costs of 0.51% in 2014. As a result, our net interest spread increased from 3.63% in 2014 to 3.97% in 2015. Average noninterest-bearing deposits grew from $150.0 million in 2014 to $269.0 million in 2015, reducing our overall funding cost. The combination of the higher loan yields and lower funding costs led to an expansion in our net interest margin from 3.75% in 2014 to 4.10% in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Our higher net interest income in 2015 was partially offset by higher operating expenses, which grew to $40.2 million in 2015 from $23.5 million in 2014. The largest category of operating expense increase was salaries and employee benefits. The higher operating expenses resulted from both our expansion activities in 2015 and the inclusion of a full year of expenses attributable to CBI and United.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> On March 18, 2015, we sold 1,642,000 shares of our common stock at $19.50 per share in an underwritten initial public offering.

In total, we sold 1,897,000 shares and raised approximately $33.8 million, net of offering expenses. Our stock is now traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NCOM.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> On October 31, 2015, we closed the acquisition of Reunion, and as a result, approximately two months of revenue and expenses attributable to Reunion are included in our 2015 results. The addition of Reunion's assets and liabilities to our balance sheet increased our ending loans, deposits, and assets by approximately $275.8 million, $325.5 million and $319.0 million, respectively, although the impact on average balances was limited due to the limited period of time in 2015 that Reunion was part of NCC.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> During December 2015, we closed two branch locations, located in Birmingham, Alabama and Kissimmee, Florida.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are contained elsewhere in this report. Certain of these policies require estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following briefly describes some of the more complex policies involving a significant degree of judgment about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the creditworthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different than our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans or on groups of loans that are not impaired when the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, national, and global economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nWe assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In each instance, we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. The credit portion of the impairment, if any, is recognized as a realized loss in current earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits requires (i) having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits in future periods to permit the application of the tax benefit, (ii) that the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period facilitate the utilization of the tax benefit, and (iii) that then-current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of the purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield, which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are also handled under this method.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nThe following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.\nNet Income\n2015 vs. 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our net income was $9.6 million, compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 77.8%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was an increase in net interest income, which resulted from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, increased loan yields, and a resulting increase in net interest margin. In addition to higher net interest income, noninterest income increased by $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increased net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $16.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014. The largest increase in noninterest income during 2015 was in revenue from the mortgage division. During the year ended December 31, 2015, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $5.3 million, compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 40.7%. Other noninterest expense increased by $16.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Each category of noninterest expense increased as a result of a full year of activity from the entities that we acquired in 2014, CBI and United, and two months of activity of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate, the costs associated with our initial public offering completed during the first quarter of 2015, and the expenses associated with being a public company contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense during 2015.\nA majority of the changes in our net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from the additional revenues and expenses attributable to CBI and United, which we acquired during the second half of 2014, and the addition of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The following table details the amounts that CBI, United, and Reunion contributed to selected consolidated totals for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> United (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Reunion (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> CBI (3)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,088 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> (1) The amounts presented for United have been adjusted to reflect the 15 days that United was included in our results for 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2) The amounts presented for Reunion reflect results of operations since the date on which Reunion was acquired (October 31, 2015).\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (3) The amounts presented for CBI are through August 2015. The 2014 totals include CBI from September through December.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2014 vs. 2013\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, our net income was $5.4 million, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 34.9%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2014 compared to 2013 was an increase in net interest income resulting from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, increased loan yields, and a resulting increase in net interest margin. The increased net interest income was partially offset by a reduction in noninterest income of $270 thousand, an increase in loan loss provision expense of $978 thousand, and an increase in noninterest expense of $3.8 million during 2014. The largest reduction in noninterest income during 2014 was in revenue from the mortgage division. During the year ended December 31, 2014, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $3.8 million, compared to $4.0 million for year ended December 31, 2013, a reduction of 7.0%. Other noninterest expenses increased by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Each category of noninterest expense increased as a result of the growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate.\nNet income also increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the acquisition of CBI on August 29, 2014. CBI contributed $4.2 million of net interest income and $741 thousand of net income during the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in net interest income for 2014 is a discount accretion of $174 thousand related to factored receivables acquired in the CBI acquisition. (Note that this CBI net income contribution figure differs from that in our segment reporting, because it does not include the funding cost allocation used in management's segment reporting. See Note 17, Segment Reporting,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.) The United acquisition closed on December 15, 2014 and, consequently, did not have a material impact on our net income for 2014.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by average earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in earning asset and interest-bearing liability volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our primary source of earnings.\nThe following table shows, for the periods indicated, the average balance of each principal category of our assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET INTEREST ANALYSIS\nTwelve

December 31, 2015 and 2014\nNet interest income increased by $21.6 million, or 75.6%, to $50.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $28.5 million for 2014. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $23.5 million, resulting from higher levels of loan volume, which was partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 60.9% increase in average loans outstanding during 2015 compared to 2014. The resulting net interest margin for 2015 rose to 4.10%, from 3.75% during 2014. The net interest margin in 2015 benefited from increased loan yields and much higher loan volume, as well as an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. During 2015, noninterest-bearing deposits averaged $269.0 million, compared to $150.0 million during 2014, an increase of $119.0 million, or 79.3%\nInterest-earning assets averaged $1.22 billion for 2015, compared to $759.5 million for 2014, an increase of $460.3 million, or 60.6%. See additional information on the growth in our loan portfolio for the periods presented beginning on page 54. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 38 basis points to 4.52% during 2015, compared to 4.14% for 2014. The yield on earning assets increased primarily due to an increased yield on loans during 2015. During 2015, loan yields increased by 49 basis points to 5.17%. The increase in loan yields was due to higher yields on the acquired portfolios of United and Reunion and the factored receivables purchased from and originated by CBI. These factored receivables are generally much higher-yielding assets than the assets in our traditional loan portfolio. The yield on the factored receivables varies but is approximately 15%. CBI contributed an average loan balance of $74.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $877.1 million for 2015, compared to $563.7 million for 2014, an increase of $313.5 million, or 55.6%. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.55% for 2015, compared to 0.51% for 2014. Each category of deposits has experienced small rate increases with the exception of interest-bearing demand deposits, which experienced a slight rate decrease. The rates paid by United and Reunion were slightly higher than rates on our non-acquired deposit base. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and 4 basis point increase in the rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities increased our total interest expense by $1.9 million in 2015 to $4.8 million.\nComparison of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nNet interest income increased by $7.8 million, or 37.6%, to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $20.7 million for 2013. The increase was due to an increase in interest income of $8.0 million, resulting from higher levels of loan volume, which was partially offset by a $256 thousand increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 29.5% increase in average loans outstanding during 2014 compared to 2013. The resulting net interest margin for 2014 rose to 3.75%, from 3.25% during 2013. The net interest margin in 2014 benefited from increased loan yields and volume, as well as an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. During 2014, noninterest-bearing deposits averaged $150.0 million, compared to $93.4 million during 2013, an increase of $56.2 million, or 59.8%\nInterest-earning assets averaged $759.5 million for 2014, compared to $636.9 million for 2013, an increase of $122.6 million, or 19.3%. See additional information on the growth in our loan portfolio for the periods presented beginning on page 54. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased by 46 basis points to 4.14% during 2014, compared to 3.68% for 2013. The yield on earning assets increased primarily due to an increased yield on loans during 2014. During 2014, loan yields increased by 31 basis points to 4.68%. The increase in loan yields was primarily due to the factored receivables purchased from and originated by CBI. These factored receivables are generally much higher-yielding assets than the assets in our traditional loan portfolio. The yield on the factored receivables varies but is approximately 15%. CBI contributed average loan balances of $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest-bearing liabilities averaged $563.7 million for 2014, compared to $478.9 million for 2013, an increase of $84.8 million, or 17.7%. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.51% for 2014, compared to 0.55% for 2013. Each category of deposits either experienced rate reductions or had rates remain virtually flat compared to 2013. We have benefited from the historically low interest rates and repriced time deposits at maturity at the lower current market rates, and we have also reduced rates on other deposit accounts to lower market rates where possible. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by the rate reductions but overall resulted in slightly higher total interest expense for 2014.\nThe following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates paid or earned on these assets and liabilities.\nANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td>

provision for loan losses of $1.1 million, compared to $978 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2014. The provision expense for 2015 was primarily related to the real estate-mortgage\u201d and construction\u201d portfolios, and the 2014 provision expense was related to our factored receivables and related risk of loss at CBI. We did not record a provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses (which is a charge to earnings) and loan recoveries, and is decreased by charge-offs. In determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider our historical loan loss experience, the general economic environment, the overall portfolio composition, and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes. When individual loans are evaluated and an impairment is deemed necessary, the impaired portion of the loan amount is generally charged off. As of December 31, 2015, none of our allowance was related to impaired loans.\nNoninterest Income\nIn addition to net interest margin, we generate other types of recurring noninterest income from our operations. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. We have a mortgage division that generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, and we have a revenue-sharing relationship with a registered broker-dealer that has representatives located in some of our banking offices. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, the Bank owns insurance on several key employees and records income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies.\nAdditionally, during the 2015 second quarter, we began earning revenue as a sponsor bank for a provider of electronic transaction processing services for retail merchants and the consumer finance industry. This sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard networks allows the processor to accept debit and credit card transactions, and we earn a fee on each such transaction.\nThe following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated.\nNONINTEREST INCOME\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges and fees on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>630 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage origination and fee income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,035 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merchant sponsorship revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wealth management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) gain on sale of other real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) gain on sale of investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>570 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,302 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $8.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest income was higher revenue from the mortgage division. Mortgage division income increased by $1.5 million during 2015 and totaled $5.3 million for the year, compared to $3.8 million during 2014. Mortgage division production totaled $281.7 million during 2015, compared to $207.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, which led to the increased mortgage division income. During the year ended December 31, 2014, refinance activity accounted for approximately 17.6% of production volume, compared to approximately 22.2% during 2015. Merchant sponsorship revenue totaled $861 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015, and there was no corresponding revenue for 2014, since we entered this business line during 2015. Service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased by $574 thousand to $1.3 million for 2015. This increase was a result of the impact of a full year of revenue attributable to United and two months of revenue attributable to Reunion. We have also experienced an increase in the number of our deposit accounts as we continue to gain momentum in our markets.\nNoninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $5.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The primary reason for the decrease in noninterest income was lower revenue from the mortgage division. Mortgage division income decreased by $283 thousand during 2014 and totaled $3.8 million for the year, compared to $4.0 million during 2013. The 2013 period benefited from refinance activity associated with historically low mortgage rates. Although rates remained low during 2014, the volume of refinance activity was lower than prior periods since rates had been at low levels for a long period of time, resulting in fewer customers who had not already refinanced mortgages at lower rates. During the year ended December 31, 2013, refinance activity accounted for approximately 26.8% of production volume, compared to approximately 17.5% during 2014. Service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased by $84 thousand to $714 thousand for 2014. This increase was a result of an increase in the number of deposit accounts as we continue to gain momentum and market share in our markets. During 2014, we recorded a loss of $33 thousand on the sale of an investment, and, during 2013, we recorded a gain of $47 thousand on the sale of an investment.\nNoninterest expense\nOur total noninterest expense increase reflects our continued growth, as well as the expansion of our operational framework, employee expansion, and facility expansion, as we build the foundation to support our recent and future growth. We believe that some of our overhead costs will decrease as a percentage of our revenue as we grow and gain operating leverage by spreading these costs over a larger revenue base.\nThe following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated.\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commission-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,948 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,727 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising and marketing expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC insurance assessments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>368 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounting and audit expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>362 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting and other professional expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned, repossessed asset and other collection expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Core deposit intangible amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,685 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $40.2 million and $23.5 million, respectively. The inclusion of United, CBI and Reunion in our results of operations accounted for approximately $11.2 million of the $16.8 million increase in noninterest expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe largest components of noninterest expense are related to employee costs shown in the table above as salaries and employee benefits expense and commission-based compensation expense. Salaries continue to increase as we expand our presence in the markets in which we operate. In April 2014, we opened a loan production office (which we converted to a full-service branch in November 2014) in Vero Beach, Florida, which contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits expense during the year ended December 31, 2015. Commission-based compensation expense is directly related to mortgage loan origination activity and certain production activity at CBI. The higher levels of revenue for the mortgage division contributed to the increased commission-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, salaries and benefits expense for CBI's, United's and Reunion's employees contributed approximately $7.0 million of the combined $9.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense and commission-based compensation expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEach category of noninterest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2015. This was largely a result of the additional expenses associated with the operations of CBI, United and Reunion. Also, accounting and other professional services expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with merger-related activities, our initial public offering in March 2015 and costs associated with being a public company.\nNoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $23.4 million and $19.7 million, respectively. The largest components of noninterest expense were related to employee costs shown in the table above as salaries and employee benefits and commission-based compensation. Salaries continue to increase as we expand our presence in the markets in which we operate. During April 2014, we opened a loan production office (converted to a full-service branch in November 2014) in Vero Beach, Florida, which contributed to the increase in salaries during 2014. Commission-based compensation is directly related to mortgage loan origination activity and activity at CBI. Total commissions paid varies with mortgage lending volume and production activity at CBI. Commissions related to mortgage lending decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower mortgage lending revenue, but overall commissions were higher during 2014 due to commissions paid at CBI. Additionally, salaries and benefits for CBI's employees were included for four months (following the August 29, 2014 acquisition) and United's employees for 15 days (following the December 15, 2014 merger) of 2014, adding to the increased employee costs for the 2014 period. Legal fees and accounting and audit expense were higher in 2014 primarily due to merger-related activities and costs associated with our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and preparations for becoming a public company. The changes in the other components of noninterest expense were due to the recent acquisition of CBI, the United merger and our overall asset expansion, facilities growth, and expanding geographic footprint.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax expense of $5.5 million, $3.2 million, and $2.3 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase in income tax expense during each year was due to an increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the 2015, 2014, and 2013 was 31.9% (36.3% including the minority interest), 34.8% (36.9% including the minority interest), and 36.6%, respectively. Our effective tax rate will generally increase with higher levels of taxable income. The effective tax rates are affected by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal and state taxation.\nComparison of Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nOverview\nOur total assets increased by $624.9 million, or 54.9%, from $1.14 billion at December 31, 2014, to $1.76 billion at December 31, 2015. Total assets at December 31, 2015 included the assets of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. Loans increased by $430.7 million, or 48.5%, from $888.7 million at December 31, 2014 to $1.32 billion at December 31, 2015. Total assets and loans at December 31, 2015 included assets and loans of Reunion. At December 31, 2015, the assets and loans attributable to Reunion totaled $319.0 million and $275.8 million, respectively.\nDeposits at December 31, 2015 totaled $1.51 billion, an increase of $543.4 million compared to December 31, 2014. Our deposits increased during 2015 due to the acquisition of Reunion and the successful business development efforts of our employees as we continue to move banking relationships from other financial institutions. For several years, the Bank has benefited from excess liquidity in the financial markets, as investors are unwilling to make long-term investments due to the low interest rate environment and elect to maintain cash in interest-bearing transaction and money market accounts. At December 31, 2015, the deposits attributable to Reunion totaled $325.5 million.\nOur total assets increased by $346.6 million, or 43.8%, from $791.8 million at December 31, 2013 to $1.14 billion at December 31, 2014. Total assets at December 31, 2013 included a $35.0 million short-term loan secured by a certificate of deposit in the same amount that was reflected on our balance sheet at year end 2013, but not at year end 2014. This loan was paid off very shortly after the 2013 year end through liquidation of the related certificate of deposit. Total assets at December 31, 2014 included the assets of CBI, which was acquired in August 2014, and United, which was merged with and into NCC in December 2014. Excluding the impact of the short-term loan and acquired assets of CBI and United, total assets increased by $35.2 million during 2014. Excluding the impact of the short-term loan and the acquired factored receivables from CBI and loans from United, loans increased by $110.2 million during 2014. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $701 thousand during 2014. However, United had cash and cash equivalents of $37.1 million at acquisition and securities totaling $25.4 million that were liquidated immediately after acquisition. Our cash and cash equivalents would have decreased by $78.5 million without the cash acquired from United and cash resulting from liquidating United's securities portfolio. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was a result of investing excess liquidity in loan growth and our use of cash to fund the CBI acquisition and the associated acquired factored receivables.\nDeposits at December 31, 2014 totaled $971.1 million, an increase of $293.0 million compared to December 31, 2013. Total deposits at December 31, 2013 included the short-term certificate of deposit of $35.0 million securing the loan referenced above. Excluding this short-term deposit and the deposits assumed in the United acquisition, deposits increased by $127.5 million during 2014. Our deposits increased during 2014 due to the successful business development efforts of our employees as we continue to move banking relationships from other financial institutions. Additionally, the Bank has benefited from excess liquidity in the financial markets, as investors are unwilling to make long-term investments due to the low interest rate environment and elect to maintain cash in interest-bearing transaction and money market accounts. In addition to the retail deposit growth, we issued $48.9 million of brokered certificates of deposits during the year ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the CBI acquisition.\nLoans\nLoans are our largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of earning assets. Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. Total loans averaged $1.01 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, or 83.0% of average earning assets, compared to $629.0 million, or 82.8% of average earning assets, for the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, total loans, net of unearned income, were $1.32 billion, compared to $888.7 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $430.7 million, or 48.5%. Excluding the loans acquired from Reunion totaling $258.4 million, loans increased by $172.3 million, or 19.4%, during 2015.\nTotal loans averaged $629.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, or 82.8% of average earning assets, compared to $485.8 million, or 76.3% of average earning assets, for the year ended December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, total loans, net of unearned income, were $888.7 million, compared to $582.0 million at December 31, 2013, an increase of $306.7 million, or 52.7%. Excluding (a) the impact of a short-term loan totaling $35.0 million that was only reflected on our balance sheet at December 31, 2013, (b) the factored receivables purchased from CBI totaling $81.6 million, and (c) loans acquired from United totaling $149.9 million, loans increased by $110.2 million, or 20.2%, during 2014.\nThe organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable to our ability to attract new customers from other financial institutions and overall growth in our markets. We have been successful in building banking relationships with new customers and expanding banking relationships with existing customers. We have hired several new bankers in the markets that we serve, and these employees have been successful in transitioning their former clients and attracting new clients to NBC. Our bankers are expected to be involved in their communities and to maintain business development efforts to facilitate relationships with clients, and our philosophy is to be responsive to customer needs by providing decisions in a timely manner. In addition to our business development efforts, many of the markets that we serve have shown signs of economic recovery over the last few years.\nThe table below provides a summary of the loan

any loan, other than a loan for construction purposes, secured by real estate, regardless of the purpose of the loan. It is common practice for financial institutions in our market areas, and for us in particular, to obtain a security interest in or lien on real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan. This practice tends to increase the size of the real estate loan portfolio. In many cases, we prefer real estate collateral to many other potential collateral sources, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment.\nThe principal component of our loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, this category totaled $1.03 billion and represented 78.3% of the total loan portfolio, compared to $660.9 million, or 74.3%, and $461.4 million, or 79.2%, of the total loan portfolio at year end 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nEach category of real estate mortgage loans increased during 2015. Residential mortgage loans increased by $112.5 million, or 50.9%, to $333.8 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $221.2 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Reunion loans, residential mortgage loans increased by $55.7 million, or 25.2%, during 2015. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, residential mortgages accounted for 25.3% and 24.9%, respectively, of the entire loan portfolio.\nResidential mortgage loans increased by $59.1 million, or 36.5%, to $221.2 million at December 31, 2014, compared to $162.1 million at December 31, 2013. Excluding the acquired United loans, residential mortgage loans increased by $25.0 million, or 15.4%, during 2014. At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, residential mortgages accounted for 24.9% and 27.8%, respectively, of the entire loan portfolio.\nLoans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties ( commercial mortgage loans\u201d) increased by $178.4 million, or 53.9%, to $509.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $330.8 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Reunion loans, commercial mortgage loans increased by $51.6 million, or 15.6%, during 2015. Commercial mortgage loans increased by $112.5 million, or 51.5%, to $330.8 million at December 31, 2014, compared to $218.3 million at December 31, 2013. Excluding the acquired United loans, commercial mortgage loans increased by $33.5 million, or 15.3%, during 2014. At December 31, 2013, commercial mortgage loans totaled $218.3 million. Commercial mortgage loans are the single largest category of loans, and, at December 31, 2015, accounted for 38.6% of the portfolio. Our management team has a great deal of experience and expertise in commercial mortgages, and this loan type has traditionally comprised a large portion of our loan portfolio. Of the $509.2 million in total commercial mortgage loans at December 31, 2015, approximately $215.0 million were loans secured by owner-occupied properties.\nReal estate construction loans totaled $152.9 million at December 31, 2015, an increase $69.2 million, or 82.7%, over $83.7 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Reunion loans, real estate construction loans increased by $45.2 million, or 54.0%, during 2015. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, this loan type accounted for 11.6% and 9.4%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2013, real estate construction loans totaled $58.4 million and accounted for 10.0% of the entire loan portfolio.\nCommercial and industrial loans totaled $171.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $113.8 million at December 31, 2014. Excluding the acquired Reunion loans, commercial and industrial loans increased by $21.3 million, or 18.7%, during 2015. During 2014, commercial and industrial loans increased by $11.5 million, or 11.3%. The balance as of December 31, 2013 includes a $35.0 million CD-secured short-term loan that was repaid shortly after year end. Excluding the short-term loan and the acquired United loans, commercial and industrial loans increased by $23.0 million, or 34.2%, during 2014. We have hired several experienced commercial lenders, and the increases described above are a result of the successful efforts of these employees. We expect this trend to continue with respect to commercial and industrial loans as economic conditions continue to improve.\nFactored commercial receivables totaled $67.6 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $82.6 million at December 31, 2014. This balance will fluctuate based on several variables, such as when receivables are purchased and when and how quickly payments are received. A lower balance at a period end does not necessarily mean less purchase activity during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we purchased factored commercial receivables of $718.5 million and $745.4 million, respectively.\nThe repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us.

Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio.\nInvestment Securities\nWe use our securities portfolio primarily to enhance our overall yield on interest-earning assets and as a source of liquidity, as a tool to manage our balance sheet sensitivity and regulatory capital ratios, and as a base upon which to pledge assets for public deposits. When our liquidity position exceeds current needs and our expected loan demand, other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative. As investments mature, they are used to meet current cash needs, or they are reinvested to maintain our desired liquidity position. We have designated a portion of our securities as available-for-sale to provide flexibility in case an immediate need for liquidity arises, and we believe that the composition of the portfolio offers the flexibility that we need in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of related deferred taxes. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. We have elected to classify a portion of our investment security portfolio as held-to-maturity, as we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity. These securities are carried at amortized cost on our balance sheet.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity

government-sponsored entities and agencies of the United States, though we may in some situations also invest in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the United States. All of our mortgage-backed securities are residential securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or the Governmental National Mortgage Association. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased $12.8 million of securities classified as available-for-sale and $24.5 million of securities classified as held-to-maturity.\nAllowance for Loan Losses, Provision and Asset Quality\nAllowance for loan losses and provision\nOur allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance for loan losses.\nIn the determination of the allowance, we utilize the risk department's independent analysis of the minimum required loan loss reserve for the Company. In this analysis, problem loans are reviewed for impairment or for loss exposure based on their payment performance, probability of default, and value of the collateral. These totals are then specifically allocated to the reserve. The loan portfolio is then divided into various homogeneous risk pools utilizing collateral codes and/or loan purpose codes and internal risk ratings. Historical losses are used to estimate the probable loss in the current portfolio using both an average loss methodology and a migration loss methodology. The methodologies and the time periods considered are subjective and vary for each risk pool based on systematic risk relative to the risk department's ability to estimate losses. As every loan has a risk of loss, the calculation begins with a minimum loss allocation for each loan pool. The minimum loss is estimated based on long term-trends for the Bank, the banking industry, and the economy. A minimum loss allocation is similarly applied to letters of credit and unused lines of credit. Loss allocations are adjusted for changes in the economy, problem loans, payment performance, loan policy, management, credit administration systems, credit concentrations, loan growth, and other elements over the time periods utilized in the methodology. The adjusted loss allocations are then applied to the current balances in their respective loan pools. Loss allocations are totaled, yielding the required allowance for loan losses.\nWe incorporate the data from the allowance calculation with interim changes to that data in our ongoing determination of our allowance for loan losses. We then take into consideration other factors that may support an allowance in excess of required minimums. These factors include systems changes, historically high loan growth, changes in the economy and company management, and lending practices at the time at which the loans were made. We believe that the data that we use in determining our allowance for loan losses is sufficient to estimate the potential losses in the loan portfolio; however, actual results could differ from those

In accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, United's and Reunion's allowances for loan losses were not brought forward at acquisition; rather, the acquired loans were recorded at fair value, and any discount to fair value was recorded against the loans rather than as an allowance for loan losses. The portion of the discount deemed related to credit quality was recorded as a non-accretable difference, and the remaining discount was recorded as an accretable discount and accreted into interest income over the estimated average life of the loans using the level yield method. At December 31, 2015, United's and Reunion's acquired loan portfolios totaled $381.3 million and had an aggregate related non-accretable difference of $6.0 million and accretable discount of $4.1 million.\nFor the acquired loan portfolio, the allowance is determined for each loan pool and compared to the remaining discount for that pool. If the allowance amount calculated under the Company's methodology is greater than the Company's remaining discount, this amount is added to the reported allowance through a provision for loan losses. If the allowance amount calculated under the Company's methodology is less than the Company's recorded discount, no additional allowance or provision is recognized. Our analysis indicates that no additional allowance is necessary on our acquired loan portfolio.\nOverall, asset quality indicators have remained stable, and, as a result, provision expense has been minimal for the traditional bank loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded provision expense of $1.1 million. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we identified a factoring relationship that posed significant credit risk and required additional provision expense. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded provision expense of $978 thousand related to this exposure and other risks in the factored receivables portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not record any provision expense.\nAllocation of Allowance for Loan Losses\nWhile no portion of our allowance for loan losses is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following table represents management's allocation of our allowance for loan losses to specific loan categories for the periods indicated.\nALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nLoans in each Category to\nTotal Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nLoans in\neach\nCategory to\nTotal Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nLoans in each Category to\nTotal Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial, financial and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,345 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.91 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.81 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.74 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Factored receivables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.02 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.05 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur allowance for loan losses is composed of general reserves and specific reserves. Specific reserves are determined by applying to each segment of our portfolio loss percentages based on that segment's historical loss experience and adjustment factors derived from internal and external environmental conditions. All loans considered to be impaired are evaluated on an individual basis to determine specific reserve allocations in accordance with GAAP. Loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the calculation of general reserves.\nA portion of the allowance is deemed to be a general reserve and remains unallocated to any particular loan category to reflect management's estimate of probable inherent but not yet specifically identified losses within the portfolio due to the nature of the portfolio and uncertainties in underwriting standards of certain loans. For example, the portfolio includes exposures to various businesses with different organizational structures that may implicate multiple segments within the allocation framework, which will inherently lead to imperfections in the loss percentages applied to the portfolio segments. These inherent risks are amplified by the fact that we remain at risk for unidentified problems in the loan portfolios that we inherited upon acquiring control of NBC, United and Reunion, as many of the loans underwritten by prior management were made using different credit policies and procedures than those that we currently use. Problems with respect to credit quality or the collectibility of these loans often are not apparent from the documentation in the file and frequently do not arise until the loan matures. For example, in some instances, sizable loans with satisfactory payment history and apparently complete documentation have led to write-offs upon maturity of the loan or a subsequent discovery of adverse information. Allocating this risk from the inherited loans to the segment portfolios is not deemed advisable by management due to the breadth of exposure of these loans over the portfolio segments.\nManagement evaluates the adequacy and allocation of our allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. Recent variations in the unallocated portion of the allowance have been driven by management's estimate of probable inherent losses within the portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified due in large part to the factors discussed above and consideration of such additional factors as changes in the nature and volume of our loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect borrowers' ability to pay, overall portfolio quality, and review of specific problem loans. In general, we expect that the portion of the unallocated allowance attributable to inherited loans will decrease over time as new loans are made and additional information becomes available with respect to currently unidentified problems and expected losses for the inherited loans. However, because management's allocation of the allowance among the various loan types is driven by several factors, this decrease may not be linear during certain time frames.\nOur procedures for allocating the allowance support an incurred, rather than expected, loss model through utilization of both specific and general reserves (including the unallocated amount). Although leaving a portion of the allowance unallocated may appear to indicate the expectation of future events, it in fact addresses the potential for additional losses on the current portfolio. We deem it prudent to include this component of measurement in our allowance for loan losses and believe that it is appropriate to apply it as an unallocated amount based on the current information available in the files and our exposure to incurred losses over the various segments. In summary, the unallocated portion represents a component that explicitly accounts for the inherent imprecision in the loan loss analysis based on our specific current circumstances.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table presents our nonperforming assets for the dates indicated.\nNONPERFORMING ASSETS\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,371 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,371 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate and repossessed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,216 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.75 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.10 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.57 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses to period-end nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270.51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net charge-offs to average loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming assets to period-end loans and foreclosed property and repossessed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.72 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming loans to period-end loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower's financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful. In addition to consideration of these factors, we have a consistent and continuing policy of placing all loans on nonaccrual status if they become 90 days or more past due, excluding factored receivables. For CBI's factored receivables, which are trade credit rather than promissory notes, our practice is to charge off unpaid recourse receivables when they become 90 days past due from the invoice due date and to charge off non-recourse receivables at 120 days past due from the statement billing date. For the recourse receivables, the invoice is charged against the client reserve account established for such purposes, unless the client reserve and the client's financial resources are insufficient, at which point the amount of the invoice is charged against loans. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all accrued interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status will generally be applied to the outstanding principal balance. When a problem loan is finally resolved, there may ultimately be an actual write-down or charge-off of the principal balance of the loan that would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for loan losses.\nTotal nonperforming assets increased by $1.4 million to $7.9 million at December 31, 2015, from $6.5 million at December 31, 2014. Included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2015 are acquired nonaccrual loans of $3.5 million and acquired other real estate and repossessed assets of $92 thousand. Excluding the acquired nonperforming assets, nonperforming assets increased by $1.0 million and totaled $4.3 million at December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of one large loan relationship that was foreclosed on during the third quarter of 2015. Asset quality has been and will continue to be a primary focus of management.\nDeposits\nDeposits, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts and savings and time deposits, are the primary funding source for the Bank. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain customers, with a primary focus on building and expanding client relationships. We continue to focus on establishing a comprehensive relationship with consumer and business borrowers, seeking deposits as well as lending relationships.\nThe following table details the composition of our deposit portfolio as of the dates indicated.\nCOMPOSITION OF DEPOSITS\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest-bearing demand\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>382,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.29 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.00 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest-bearing demand\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings and money market\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>611,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>392,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>304,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time less than $100k\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time equal to or greater than $100k and less than $250k\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time equal to or greater than $250k\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.76 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,514,458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>971,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>678,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deposits were $1.51 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $543.4 million from December 31, 2014. Excluding the assumed Reunion deposits, deposits increased by $265.7 million, or 27.4%, during 2015. During 2014, deposits increased by $293.0 million. Total deposits at December 31, 2013 included a short-term certificate of deposit totaling $35.0 million securing a short-term loan in the same amount. Excluding this short-term deposit and the assumed United deposits, deposits increased by $127.5 million, or 19.8%, during 2014. During 2014, we issued brokered certificates of deposit of $48.9 million to fund a portion of the CBI acquisition. Deposit growth has been a point of emphasis, and we have benefitted from uncertainty in the financial markets, which has increased the liquidity of many banks as consumers and businesses look for safe places for liquidity, thereby increasing bank deposits.\nThe following table details the maturities of time deposits greater than $100,000 and other time deposits. Other time deposits include brokered certificates of deposit and internet certificates of deposit. Large certificate of deposit customers and brokered and internet certificate of deposit customers tend to be more sensitive to interest rate levels.\nMATURITIES OF CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT OF $100,000 OR MORE\nAND OTHER TIME DEPOSITS\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over three\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Over one year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> through\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> through\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Greater than\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> twelve months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> three years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> three years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,615 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>268,842 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Funding Sources\nWe supplement our deposit funding with wholesale funding when needed for balance sheet planning or when the terms are attractive and will not disrupt our offering rates in our markets. One source that we have used for wholesale funding is the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB\u201d). We had FHLB borrowings of $22.0 million at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We have not initiated any additional borrowings from the FHLB since 2012. We have access to brokered deposits and issued $48.9 million in brokered deposits during 2014 to fund a portion of the CBI acquisition. We had brokered deposits of $38.9 million and $48.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Another funding source that we have used to supplement our local funding is internet certificates of deposit. We have used this source to book certificates of deposit with maturities of three to five years at rates that are lower than we would offer in our local market, typically below the rates indicated on the LIBOR swap curve for similar maturities. We had internet certificate of deposit balances of $12.3 million, $14.0 million, and $13.0 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nLiquidity\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and in financial institutions in general will significantly impact our access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of failing to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\nFunds are available from a number of basic banking activity sources, including the core deposit base, the repayment and maturity of loans, and investment security cash flows. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposit, and borrowings from the FHLB.\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $212.5 million, $123.4 million, and $124.1 million, respectively. Based on the recorded cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity resources were sufficient at December 31, 2015 to fund loans and to meet other cash needs as necessary.\nContractual Obligations\nWhile our liquidity monitoring and management considers both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity, the following table of contractual commitments focuses only on future obligations.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2015\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Due in 1\nyear or\nless\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Due after 1\nthrough 3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Due after 3\nthrough 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Due after 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of less than $100k\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,069 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates of deposit of $100k or more\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229,907 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,548 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>345,524 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recorded on our balance sheet. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. We follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated.\nCREDIT EXTENSION COMMITMENTS\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded lines\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>311,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>141,887 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,066 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total credit extension commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,953 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Sensitivity and Market Risk\nInterest Sensitivity\nWe monitor and manage the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on net interest income. Our principal monitoring technique is simulation analysis, which is augmented by gap\u201d analysis.\nIn simulation analysis, we review each individual asset and liability category and their projected behavior in different interest rate environments. These projected behaviors are based on management's past experiences and current competitive environments, including the markets in which we compete. Using this projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs, the simulation analysis generates as output projections of net interest income. We also periodically verify the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models.\nAnother technique used in interest rate management, but to a lesser degree than simulation analysis, is the measurement of the interest sensitivity \"gap,\" which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities, selling securities available for sale or trading securities, replacing an asset or liability at maturity, or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing and sources and prices of off-balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk. We use computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios. The modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time.\nThe following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2015, assuming that the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid, respectively, based on historical experience rather than their stated maturities.\nINTEREST SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nAs of

<td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes mortgage loans held-for-sale\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generally benefit from increasing market rates of interest when we have an asset-sensitive gap (a positive number) and generally benefit from decreasing market interest rates when we are liability-sensitive (a negative number). As shown in the table above, we are asset-sensitive on a cumulative basis throughout all time frames presented. The interest sensitivity analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration the fact that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame, but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest-sensitive than market-based rates, such as those paid on non-core deposits. For this and other reasons, management relies more upon the simulation analysis (as noted above) in managing interest rate risk. Net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment, including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nMarket Risk\nOur earnings are dependent, to a large degree, on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest paid on all interest bearing-liabilities, primarily deposits. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in our lending, investing, and deposit-gathering activities. We seek to reduce our exposure to market risk by actively monitoring and managing interest rate risk. Management relies on the static gap\u201d analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which quantifies, to a large extent, the degree of market risk inherent in our balance sheet. Gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates. Simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from 400 basis points below the current prevailing rates to 400 basis points above the current prevailing rates. Management makes certain assumptions as to the effect that varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources.\nThe following table illustrates the results of our simulation analysis to determine the extent to which market risk would affect net interest margin for the next twelve months if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts from current rates. As noted above, this model uses estimates and assumptions regarding asset and liability account reactions to changes in prevailing interest rates. However, to isolate the market risk inherent in the balance sheet, the model assumes that no growth in the balance sheet occurs during the projection period. This model also assumes an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates, which would result in no change in the shape or slope of the interest rate yield curve. Because of the use of these estimates and assumptions in the simulation model to derive this market risk information, the actual results of the future impact of market risk on our net interest margin may (and most likely will) differ from that found in the table.\nMARKET RISK\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Impact on Net Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in prevailing interest rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +400 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.26 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.42 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.31 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -100 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.85 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.23 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.82 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -200 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.95 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.58 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.33 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -300 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.17 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.83 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.00 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> -400 basis points\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.96 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.61 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.38 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nTotal shareholders' equity attributable to us at December 31, 2015 was $209.3 million, or 11.9% of total assets.

The underwriters had an option to purchase an additional 255,000 shares, which they exercised on March 27, 2015. In total, we sold 1,897,000 shares and raised approximately $33.8 million, net of offering expenses.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC issued final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The final rules took effect for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to a transition period for certain parts of the rules. Among other things, the rules (i) revised the minimum capital requirements and adjusted the prompt corrective action thresholds applicable to financial institutions under the agencies' jurisdiction, (ii) revised the regulatory capital elements, (iii) added a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, (iv) increased the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirements, and (v) implemented a new capital conservation buffer. The rules permit certain banking organizations to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company and Bank have made the election to retain the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe rules are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank's capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories. Banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against such off-balance sheet\u201d activities as loans sold with recourse, loan commitments, guarantees and standby letters of credit. These guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity, such as preferred stock, that may be included in capital. Certain items, such as goodwill and other intangible assets, are deducted from total capital in arriving at the various regulatory capital measures, such as common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital. Our objective is to maintain our current status as a well\u2212capitalized\u201d institution, as that term is defined by the Bank's regulators. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was well-capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.\nUnder the current regulatory guidelines, banks must meet minimum capital adequacy levels based on both total assets and risk-adjusted assets. All banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%, a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (leverage ratio) of 4%. Adherence to these guidelines has not had an adverse impact on us.\nThe table below calculates and presents regulatory capital based on the new regulatory capital ratio requirements under Basel III that became effective on January 1, 2015, as well as the regulatory capital ratios in effect on December 31, 2014 and 2013. Beginning in 2016, an additional capital conservation buffer will be added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes, subject to a three-year phase-in period. The capital conservation buffer will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019 at 2.5%. A banking organization with a conservation buffer of less than 2.5% (or the required phase-in amount in years prior to 2019) will be subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The ratios for the Company and Bank are currently sufficient to satisfy the fully phased-in conservation buffer.\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated capital ratios at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 for both NBC and NCC. ULB consolidated capital ratios are shown for December 31, 2014 only. ULB was not acquired until December 2014 and then was merged with and into NBC on February 28, 2015.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY ANALYSIS\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td>

However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our subsidiaries, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when specifically identified.\nOur Business\nWe (the Company\u201d or NCC\u201d) are a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. We operate one subsidiary bank, National Bank of Commerce ( NBC\u201d). During 2014, we acquired United Group Banking Company of Florida, Inc. ( United\u201d) and on February 28, 2015, merged its banking subsidiary, United Legacy Bank ( ULB\u201d) with and into NBC. NBC now operates the former ULB locations under the trade name United Legacy Bank, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d On October 31, 2015, we acquired Reunion Bank of Florida ( Reunion\u201d) through a merger of Reunion with and into NBC. NBC now operates each of the former Reunion locations under the trade name Reunion Bank of Florida, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d\nThrough NBC, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners and professionals through seven full-service banking offices in Alabama (Birmingham, Huntsville, Auburn-Opelika, and Baldwin County) and ten full-service banking offices in Florida (Longwood, Winter Park, Orlando, Oviedo, Tavares, Port Orange, Ormond Beach, St. Augustine and Vero Beach). In addition to the full-service banking offices, we operate two loan production offices in Florida, located in Osceola and Orange Counties. We also own a 70% equity interest in CBI Holding Company, LLC ( CBI\u201d), which owns Corporate Billing, a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers throughout the United States and Canada.\n2015 Acquisition\nReunion Bank of Florida\nOn October 31, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Reunion, a Florida bank headquartered in Tavares, Florida. At that time, Reunion was merged with and into NBC, and NBC now operates in the markets formerly served by Reunion under the trade name Reunion Bank of Florida, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d Reunion had a total of four full-service banking locations and two loan production offices located in five counties in central and northeast Florida.\nReunion's common shareholders were entitled to receive either 0.7273 shares of NCC's common stock, $16.00 in cash, or a combination of stock and cash in exchange for each share of Reunion common stock, subject to certain allocation limitations and proration procedures set forth in the merger agreement. Specifically, 80% of the shares of Reunion common stock, or 1,841,418 shares, were converted into newly issued shares of NCC common stock, and the remaining 20%, or 460,355 shares, were converted into the right to receive cash. We paid cash for cash elections and in lieu of fractional shares totaling $7,368,809 and issued 1,339,129 shares of our common stock in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $43.2 million. We recorded $20.6 million of goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset of $1.5 million.\nWe marked Reunion's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of the acquisition, and these fair value adjustments are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date as additional information becomes available. We acquired approximately $309.7 million in assets at fair value from Reunion and added approximately $258.4 million in loans and approximately $277.7 million in deposits.\n2014 Acquisitions\nCBI Holding Company, LLC\nOn August 29, 2014, NBC acquired 70% of the outstanding units of CBI, which owns Corporate Billing, a receivables factoring business headquartered in Decatur, Alabama. CBI now operates as a subsidiary of NBC. We have an option to purchase the remaining 30% interest for a price based on a multiple of CBI's earnings that is exercisable at any time beginning on August 29, 2019 and expires on August 29, 2022. NBC paid $16.2 million in cash for its 70% interest in CBI. Our consolidated financial statements include all of the assets and liabilities of CBI, as well as a minority interest, representing the 30% that we have not purchased. As a result, at acquisition, we recorded $23.1 million of goodwill and a non-controlling interest of $6.9 million.\nWe marked the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to fair value based on information available at the time of the acquisition. Given an average life for CBI's receivables of 35 to 40 days, the assets and liabilities of CBI are very short-term in nature, and the book value was deemed to be the fair value, with the exception of a $174 thousand discount on the purchased factored receivables, which was accreted into income during September 2014 in accordance with the average life of the related receivables.\nUnited Group Banking Company of Florida, Inc.\nOn December 15, 2014, we completed our acquisition of United, a bank holding company headquartered in Longwood, Florida. United's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, ULB, merged with and into NBC on February 28, 2015. Since the merger, NBC has operated in the Orlando, Florida market under the trade name United Legacy Bank, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d\nAt the time of the acquisition, United was merged with and into NCC, with NCC as the surviving entity in the merger. United's common shareholders received either 0.057794 shares of our common stock, $1.30 in cash, or a combination of stock and cash in exchange for each share of United common stock. The total amount of cash that we paid was capped at $2,950,000 by the merger agreement (excluding any cash to be paid for fractional shares). We paid cash for cash elections and in lieu of fractional shares totaling $2,953,884 and issued 1,617,027 shares of our common stock. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $33.3 million. We recorded $5.7 million of goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset of $1.8 million.\nWe marked United's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $233.2 million in assets at fair value from United and added six banking centers (one of which we subsequently closed) with approximately $149.9 million in loans and approximately $200.5 million in deposits.\nAdditional information regarding the CBI acquisition and the Reunion and United mergers is included in Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\nOverview of 2015 Results\nOur net income was $9.6 million in 2015, compared with $5.4 million in 2014. The primary factors leading to the increase in the 2015 net income and other highlights include the following:\n \u25cf Average loans outstanding in 2015 were $1.01 billion, approximately 60.9% higher than the $629.0 million in average loans outstanding in 2014. The higher loan balance led to an increase in net interest income from $28.5 million in 2014 to $50.0 million in 2015. In addition to organic growth, 2015 balances include a full year of loans attributable to CBI and United. \n \u25cf Loan yields in 2015 averaged 5.17%, compared to 4.68% for 2014, and interest-bearing liability costs of 0.55% in 2015 were 0.04% higher than costs of 0.51% in 2014. As a result, our net interest spread increased from 3.63% in 2014 to 3.97% in 2015. Average noninterest-bearing deposits grew from $150.0 million in 2014 to $269.0 million in 2015, reducing our overall funding cost. The combination of the higher loan yields and lower funding costs led to an expansion in our net interest margin from 3.75% in 2014 to 4.10% in 2015. \n \u25cf Our higher net interest income in 2015 was partially offset by higher operating expenses, which grew to $40.2 million in 2015 from $23.5 million in 2014. The largest category of operating expense increase was salaries and employee benefits. The higher operating expenses resulted from both our expansion activities in 2015 and the inclusion of a full year of expenses attributable to CBI and United. \n \u25cf On March 18, 2015, we sold 1,642,000 shares of our common stock at $19.50 per share in an underwritten initial public offering. The underwriters had an option to purchase an additional 255,000 shares, which they exercised on March 27, 2015. In total, we sold 1,897,000 shares and raised approximately $33.8 million, net of offering expenses. Our stock is now traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NCOM.\u201d \n \u25cf On October 31, 2015, we closed the acquisition of Reunion, and as a result, approximately two months of revenue and expenses attributable to Reunion are included in our 2015 results. The addition of Reunion's assets and liabilities to our balance sheet increased our ending loans, deposits, and assets by approximately $275.8 million, $325.5 million and $319.0 million, respectively, although the impact on average balances was limited due to the limited period of time in 2015 that Reunion was part of NCC. \n \u25cf During December 2015, we closed two branch locations, located in Birmingham, Alabama and Kissimmee, Florida. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are contained elsewhere in this report. Certain of these policies require estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following briefly describes some of the more complex policies involving a significant degree of judgment about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the creditworthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different than our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans or on groups of loans that are not impaired when the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, national, and global economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nWe assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In each instance, we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. The credit portion of the impairment, if any, is recognized as a realized loss in current earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits requires (i) having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits in future periods to permit the application of the tax benefit, (ii) that the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period facilitate the utilization of the tax benefit, and (iii) that then-current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of the purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield, which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are also handled under this method.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nThe following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.\nNet Income\n2015 vs. 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our net income was $9.6 million, compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 77.8%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was an increase in net interest income, which resulted from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, increased loan yields, and a resulting increase in net interest margin. In addition to higher net interest income, noninterest income increased by $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increased net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $16.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014. The largest increase in noninterest income during 2015 was in revenue from the mortgage division. During the year ended December 31, 2015, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $5.3 million, compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 40.7%. Other noninterest expense increased by $16.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Each category of noninterest expense increased as a result of a full year of activity from the entities that we acquired in 2014, CBI and United, and two months of activity of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate, the costs associated with our initial public offering completed during the first quarter of 2015, and the expenses associated with being a public company contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense during 2015.\nA majority of the changes in our net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from the additional revenues and expenses attributable to CBI and United, which we acquired during the second half of 2014, and the addition of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The following table details the amounts that CBI, United, and Reunion contributed to selected consolidated totals for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\n (1) The amounts presented for United have been adjusted to reflect the 15 days that United was included in our results for 2014. (2) The amounts presented for Reunion reflect results of operations since the date on which Reunion was acquired (October 31, 2015). (3) The amounts presented for CBI are through August 2015. The 2014 totals include CBI from September through December. \n2014 vs. 2013\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, our net income was $5.4 million, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 34.9%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2014 compared to 2013 was an increase in net interest income resulting from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, increased loan yields, and a resulting increase in net interest margin. The increased net interest income was partially offset by a reduction in noninterest income of $270 thousand, an increase in loan loss provision expense of $978 thousand, and an increase in noninterest expense of $3.8 million during 2014. The largest reduction in noninterest income during 2014 was in revenue from the mortgage division. During the year ended December 31, 2014, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $3.8 million, compared to $4.0 million for year ended December 31, 2013, a reduction of 7.0%. Other noninterest expenses increased by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Each category of noninterest expense increased as a result of the growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate.\nNet income also increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the acquisition of CBI on August 29, 2014. CBI contributed $4.2 million of net interest income and $741 thousand of net income during the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in net interest income for 2014 is a discount accretion of $174 thousand related to factored receivables acquired in the CBI acquisition. (Note that this CBI net income contribution figure differs from that in our segment reporting, because it does not include the funding cost allocation used in management's segment reporting. See Note 17, Segment Reporting,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.) The United acquisition closed on December 15, 2014 and, consequently, did not have a material impact on our net income for 2014.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by average earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in earning asset and interest-bearing liability volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our primary source of earnings.\nThe following table shows, for the periods indicated, the average balance of each principal category of our assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET INTEREST ANALYSIS\nTwelve

We operate one subsidiary bank, National Bank of Commerce ( NBC\u201d). During 2014, we acquired United Group Banking Company of Florida, Inc. ( United\u201d) and on February 28, 2015, merged its banking subsidiary, United Legacy Bank ( ULB\u201d) with and into NBC. NBC now operates the former ULB locations under the trade name United Legacy Bank, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d On October 31, 2015, we acquired Reunion Bank of Florida ( Reunion\u201d) through a merger of Reunion with and into NBC. NBC now operates each of the former Reunion locations under the trade name Reunion Bank of Florida, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d\nThrough NBC, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners and professionals through seven full-service banking offices in Alabama (Birmingham, Huntsville, Auburn-Opelika, and Baldwin County) and ten full-service banking offices in Florida (Longwood, Winter Park, Orlando, Oviedo, Tavares, Port Orange, Ormond Beach, St. Augustine and Vero Beach). In addition to the full-service banking offices, we operate two loan production offices in Florida, located in Osceola and Orange Counties. We also own a 70% equity interest in CBI Holding Company, LLC ( CBI\u201d), which owns Corporate Billing, a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers throughout the United States and Canada.\n2015 Acquisition\nReunion Bank of Florida\nOn October 31, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Reunion, a Florida bank headquartered in Tavares, Florida. At that time, Reunion was merged with and into NBC, and NBC now operates in the markets formerly served by Reunion under the trade name Reunion Bank of Florida, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d Reunion had a total of four full-service banking locations and two loan production offices located in five counties in central and northeast Florida.\nReunion's common shareholders were entitled to receive either 0.7273 shares of NCC's common stock, $16.00 in cash, or a combination of stock and cash in exchange for each share of Reunion common stock, subject to certain allocation limitations and proration procedures set forth in the merger agreement. Specifically, 80% of the shares of Reunion common stock, or 1,841,418 shares, were converted into newly issued shares of NCC common stock, and the remaining 20%, or 460,355 shares, were converted into the right to receive cash. We paid cash for cash elections and in lieu of fractional shares totaling $7,368,809 and issued 1,339,129 shares of our common stock in the merger. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $43.2 million. We recorded $20.6 million of goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset of $1.5 million.\nWe marked Reunion's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of the acquisition, and these fair value adjustments are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date as additional information becomes available. We acquired approximately $309.7 million in assets at fair value from Reunion and added approximately $258.4 million in loans and approximately $277.7 million in deposits.\n2014 Acquisitions\nCBI Holding Company, LLC\nOn August 29, 2014, NBC acquired 70% of the outstanding units of CBI, which owns Corporate Billing, a receivables factoring business headquartered in Decatur, Alabama. CBI now operates as a subsidiary of NBC. We have an option to purchase the remaining 30% interest for a price based on a multiple of CBI's earnings that is exercisable at any time beginning on August 29, 2019 and expires on August 29, 2022. NBC paid $16.2 million in cash for its 70% interest in CBI. Our consolidated financial statements include all of the assets and liabilities of CBI, as well as a minority interest, representing the 30% that we have not purchased. As a result, at acquisition, we recorded $23.1 million of goodwill and a non-controlling interest of $6.9 million.\nWe marked the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to fair value based on information available at the time of the acquisition. Given an average life for CBI's receivables of 35 to 40 days, the assets and liabilities of CBI are very short-term in nature, and the book value was deemed to be the fair value, with the exception of a $174 thousand discount on the purchased factored receivables, which was accreted into income during September 2014 in accordance with the average life of the related receivables.\nUnited Group Banking Company of Florida, Inc.\nOn December 15, 2014, we completed our acquisition of United, a bank holding company headquartered in Longwood, Florida. United's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, ULB, merged with and into NBC on February 28, 2015. Since the merger, NBC has operated in the Orlando, Florida market under the trade name United Legacy Bank, a division of National Bank of Commerce.\u201d\nAt the time of the acquisition, United was merged with and into NCC, with NCC as the surviving entity in the merger. United's common shareholders received either 0.057794 shares of our common stock, $1.30 in cash, or a combination of stock and cash in exchange for each share of United common stock. The total amount of cash that we paid was capped at $2,950,000 by the merger agreement (excluding any cash to be paid for fractional shares). We paid cash for cash elections and in lieu of fractional shares totaling $2,953,884 and issued 1,617,027 shares of our common stock. The aggregate estimated value of the consideration was $33.3 million. We recorded $5.7 million of goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset of $1.8 million.\nWe marked United's assets and liabilities to fair value based on information available at the time of acquisition. We acquired approximately $233.2 million in assets at fair value from United and added six banking centers (one of which we subsequently closed) with approximately $149.9 million in loans and approximately $200.5 million in deposits.\nAdditional information regarding the CBI acquisition and the Reunion and United mergers is included in Note 2, Business Combinations,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provided herein.\nOverview of 2015 Results\nOur net income was $9.6 million in 2015, compared with $5.4 million in 2014. The primary factors leading to the increase in the 2015 net income and other highlights include the following:\n \u25cf Average loans outstanding in 2015 were $1.01 billion, approximately 60.9% higher than the $629.0 million in average loans outstanding in 2014. The higher loan balance led to an increase in net interest income from $28.5 million in 2014 to $50.0 million in 2015. In addition to organic growth, 2015 balances include a full year of loans attributable to CBI and United. \n \u25cf Loan yields in 2015 averaged 5.17%, compared to 4.68% for 2014, and interest-bearing liability costs of 0.55% in 2015 were 0.04% higher than costs of 0.51% in 2014. As a result, our net interest spread increased from 3.63% in 2014 to 3.97% in 2015. Average noninterest-bearing deposits grew from $150.0 million in 2014 to $269.0 million in 2015, reducing our overall funding cost. The combination of the higher loan yields and lower funding costs led to an expansion in our net interest margin from 3.75% in 2014 to 4.10% in 2015. \n \u25cf Our higher net interest income in 2015 was partially offset by higher operating expenses, which grew to $40.2 million in 2015 from $23.5 million in 2014. The largest category of operating expense increase was salaries and employee benefits. The higher operating expenses resulted from both our expansion activities in 2015 and the inclusion of a full year of expenses attributable to CBI and United. \n \u25cf On March 18, 2015, we sold 1,642,000 shares of our common stock at $19.50 per share in an underwritten initial public offering. The underwriters had an option to purchase an additional 255,000 shares, which they exercised on March 27, 2015. In total, we sold 1,897,000 shares and raised approximately $33.8 million, net of offering expenses. Our stock is now traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NCOM.\u201d \n \u25cf On October 31, 2015, we closed the acquisition of Reunion, and as a result, approximately two months of revenue and expenses attributable to Reunion are included in our 2015 results. The addition of Reunion's assets and liabilities to our balance sheet increased our ending loans, deposits, and assets by approximately $275.8 million, $325.5 million and $319.0 million, respectively, although the impact on average balances was limited due to the limited period of time in 2015 that Reunion was part of NCC. \n \u25cf During December 2015, we closed two branch locations, located in Birmingham, Alabama and Kissimmee, Florida. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are contained elsewhere in this report. Certain of these policies require estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments is necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following briefly describes some of the more complex policies involving a significant degree of judgment about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the creditworthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different than our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans or on groups of loans that are not impaired when the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, national, and global economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInvestment Securities Impairment\nWe assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In each instance, we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. The credit portion of the impairment, if any, is recognized as a realized loss in current earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is more likely than not\u201d that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits requires (i) having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits in future periods to permit the application of the tax benefit, (ii) that the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period facilitate the utilization of the tax benefit, and (iii) that then-current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of the purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield, which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are also handled under this method.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\nThe following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.\nNet Income\n2015 vs. 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, our net income was $9.6 million, compared to $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 77.8%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was an increase in net interest income, which resulted from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, increased loan yields, and a resulting increase in net interest margin. In addition to higher net interest income, noninterest income increased by $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increased net interest income and noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $16.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014. The largest increase in noninterest income during 2015 was in revenue from the mortgage division. During the year ended December 31, 2015, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $5.3 million, compared to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 40.7%. Other noninterest expense increased by $16.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Each category of noninterest expense increased as a result of a full year of activity from the entities that we acquired in 2014, CBI and United, and two months of activity of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate, the costs associated with our initial public offering completed during the first quarter of 2015, and the expenses associated with being a public company contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense during 2015.\nA majority of the changes in our net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from the additional revenues and expenses attributable to CBI and United, which we acquired during the second half of 2014, and the addition of Reunion, which we acquired on October 31, 2015. The following table details the amounts that CBI, United, and Reunion contributed to selected consolidated totals for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> United (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Reunion (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> CBI (3)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,088 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Noninterest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The amounts presented for United have been adjusted to reflect the 15 days that United was included in our results for 2014. (2) The amounts presented for Reunion reflect results of operations since the date on which Reunion was acquired (October 31, 2015). (3) The amounts presented for CBI are through August 2015. The 2014 totals include CBI from September through December. \n2014 vs. 2013\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, our net income was $5.4 million, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 34.9%. The primary reason for the increase in net income in 2014 compared to 2013 was an increase in net interest income resulting from higher levels of loan balances and other earning assets, increased loan yields, and a resulting increase in net interest margin. The increased net interest income was partially offset by a reduction in noninterest income of $270 thousand, an increase in loan loss provision expense of $978 thousand, and an increase in noninterest expense of $3.8 million during 2014. The largest reduction in noninterest income during 2014 was in revenue from the mortgage division. During the year ended December 31, 2014, mortgage origination and fee income totaled $3.8 million, compared to $4.0 million for year ended December 31, 2013, a reduction of 7.0%. Other noninterest expenses increased by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Each category of noninterest expense increased as a result of the growth of our franchise in the markets in which we operate.\nNet income also increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the acquisition of CBI on August 29, 2014. CBI contributed $4.2 million of net interest income and $741 thousand of net income during the year ended December 31, 2014. Included in net interest income for 2014 is a discount accretion of $174 thousand related to factored receivables acquired in the CBI acquisition. (Note that this CBI net income contribution figure differs from that in our segment reporting, because it does not include the funding cost allocation used in management's segment reporting. See Note 17, Segment Reporting,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information.) The United acquisition closed on December 15, 2014 and, consequently, did not have a material impact on our net income for 2014.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nThe largest component of our net income is net interest income - the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by average earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in earning asset and interest-bearing liability volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our primary source of earnings.\nThe following table shows, for the periods indicated, the average balance of each principal category of our assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET INTEREST ANALYSIS\nTwelve
