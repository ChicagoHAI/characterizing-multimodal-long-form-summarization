MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is management's assessment of Northwest Natural Gas Company's (NW Natural or the Company) financial condition, including the principal factors that affect results of operations. The discussion refers to our consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. References in this discussion to \"Notes\" are to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nThe consolidated financial statements include NW Natural and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries including:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NW Natural Energy, LLC (NWN Energy);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NW Natural Gas Storage, LLC (NWN Gas Storage);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gill Ranch Storage, LLC (Gill Ranch);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NNG Financial Corporation (NNG Financial);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Northwest Energy Corporation (Energy Corp); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NWN Gas Reserves LLC (NWN Gas Reserves).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe operate in two primary reportable business segments: local gas distribution and gas storage. We also have other investments and business activities not specifically related to one of these two reporting segments, which we aggregate and report as other. We refer to our local gas distribution business as the utility, and our gas storage segment and other as non-utility. Our utility segment includes our NW Natural local gas distribution business, NWN Gas Reserves, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Corp, and the utility portion of our Mist underground storage facility in Oregon (Mist). Our gas storage segment includes NWN Gas Storage, which is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of NWN Energy, Gill Ranch, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NWN Gas Storage, the non-utility portion of Mist, and asset management services. Other includes NWN Energy's equity investment in Trail West Holding, LLC (TWH), which is pursuing the development of a proposed natural gas pipeline through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Trail West Pipeline, LLC (TWP), and NNG Financial's equity investment in Kelso-Beaver Pipeline (KB Pipeline). For a further discussion of our business segments and other, see Note 4.\nIn addition to presenting the results of operations and earnings amounts in total, certain financial measures are expressed in cents per share or exclude the after-tax regulatory disallowances related to the OPUC's 2015 and 2016 environmental orders, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We present net income and earnings per share (EPS) excluding the regulatory disallowances along with the U.S. GAAP measures to illustrate the magnitude of these disallowances on ongoing business and operational results. Although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income and earnings per share under U.S. GAAP, we believe the amount and nature of such disallowances make period to period comparisons of operations difficult or potentially confusing. Financial measures are expressed in cents per share as these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings, including income taxes. All references in this section to EPS are on the basis of diluted shares (see Note 3). We use such non-GAAP financial measures to analyze our financial performance because we believe they provide useful information to our investors and creditors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe manage our business and strategic initiatives with a long-term view of providing natural gas service safely and reliably to customers, working with regulators on key policy initiatives, and remaining focused on growing our business. See \"2017 Outlook\" below for more information. Highlights for the year include:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>added over 10,700 customers during the past twelve months for a growth rate of 1.5% at December 31, 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>invested $140 million in our distribution system and facilities for growth and reliability, as well as for our North Mist gas storage expansion project;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>received approval to begin construction of our $128 million North Mist gas storage expansion project with a target in-service date of the winter of 2018-19;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continued our legacy of excellent customer service with the highest residential customer satisfaction score among large utilities in the West and the second highest residential score in the nation in the 2016 J.D.

Regulatory environmental disallowance of $15.0 million in 2015 is recorded in utility operations and maintenance expense. Adjusted consolidated net income and EPS and adjusted ROE are non-GAAP financial measures based on the after-tax disallowance using the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 39.5%. EPS is calculated using 27.8 million, 27.4 million, and 27.2 million diluted shares for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\n2016 COMPARED TO 2015. Overall, consolidated net income increased $5.2 million. The increase was primarily due to the $9.1 million after-tax charge from 2015 and a $2.0 million after-tax charge in 2016 related to the regulatory disallowances associated with a February 2015 OPUC Order and subsequent Order in our SRRM docket. See additional disclosure in the table above.\nExcluding the impact of the non-cash charges from the SRRM docket in 2015 and 2016, adjusted consolidated net income decreased $1.9 million primarily due to the following factors:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $7.0 million increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the second half of 2015 that did not recur in 2016; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $5.5 million decrease in other income (expense), net primarily related to the recognition of $5.3 million of equity earnings on deferred regulatory asset balances as a result of the 2015 OPUC Order; partially offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $5.2 million increase in utility margin primarily due to customer growth and gains from gas cost incentive sharing; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $3.9 million increase in gas storage revenues largely due to higher revenues from our asset management\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nagreements at both storage facilities and slightly higher contract values at our Gill Ranch facility for the 2016-17 gas year.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014. Overall, consolidated net income decreased $5.0 million primarily due to the $9.1 million after-tax charge related to the February 2015 OPUC Order previously discussed. Excluding the impact of this Order, adjusted consolidated net income increased $4.1 million primarily due to the following factors:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $5.3 million increase in utility margin primarily due to customer growth and gas cost sharing, partially offset by the effects of warmer weather; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $5.8 million increase in other income (expense), net related to the recognition of equity earnings on deferred regulatory asset balances as a result of the OPUC SRRM Order; partially offset by\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $5.5 million increase in operations and maintenance expense mainly due to higher compensation and benefits expense; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $0.9 million decrease in gas storage operating revenues due to negative impacts of decreases in storage prices between the 2013-14 and 2014-15 gas years; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $1.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses due to additional utility capital expenditures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 OUTLOOK\nOur near-term outlook is centered on six long-term strategic objectives (1) delivering natural gas safely and reliably to our customers; (2) providing superior customer service; (3) working closely with policymakers and regulators to constructively meet the interests of all parties; (4) enabling continued utility growth; (5) leveraging the benefits of natural gas and our modern system to lead our region to a low-carbon future; and (6) strategically investing in our existing utility and gas storage businesses, as well as creating new ideas to drive future growth opportunities and to ensure long-term profitability.\nOur 2017 goals leverage our resources and history of innovation to continue meeting the evolving needs of customers, regulators, and shareholders.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deliver Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Grow Our Businesses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ensure Safe and Reliable Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Enable Utility Growth\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Provide a Superior Customer Experience\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lead in a Low-Carbon Future\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Advance Constructive Policies and Regulation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pursue Strategic Investments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSAFETY AND RELIABILITY. Delivering natural gas safely and reliably to customers is our first priority. During 2017, we will maintain our vigilant focus on safety and emergency response training for our employees, third-party contractors, and local authorities. We will continue to strive to increase public awareness of natural gas safety and protocols to reduce damages to our critical infrastructure. Continued investment in our pipeline system and facilities is also planned to ensure reliability with multi-year projects at our LNG facilities and Mist storage facility, as well as system upgrades in high-growth areas such as Clark County, Washington. Finally, safety also includes our continuous maintenance of strong cybersecurity defenses and preparation for large-scale emergency events, such as seismic hazards in our region.\nSUPERIOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. NW Natural has a legacy of providing excellent customer service with consistently high rankings in the J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction studies and a long-standing dedication to continuous improvement. In 2017, we will continue evolving to meet our customers' changing expectations by examining our customer interactions and touchpoints as well as the technology supporting these processes. We expect this comprehensive effort to propel further use of our innovative online customer connection portal and the latest technology, providing customers with an enhanced experience while improving operational efficiencies.\nPOLICIES AND REGULATION. Constructive policies and regulation provide the best outcomes for both customers and shareholders. In 2017, we plan to work closely with policymakers and regulators to plan for growth of our utility, and evaluate the investments necessary for this growth in our IRP. Finally, we will continue working with the EPA and other stakeholders on an environmentally protective and cost effective clean-up for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site.\nUTILITY GROWTH. Natural gas is a preferred energy choice in our service territory due to its efficiency and affordability coupled with our exceptional service. In 2017, we will continue leveraging these key attributes to capitalize on our region's above-average economic growth. We remain focused on maintaining our strong market share in the single-family residential sector, as well as capturing new commercial customers. As our Portland, Oregon community continues to experience in-migration and greater urban density, multifamily housing construction continues to outpace historical levels. Seeing this trend, we have launched a comprehensive effort to make inroads in the multifamily market with streamlined infrastructure designs, engineering technical support, and incentives and promotional support for qualifying projects. We will continue pursuing this sector in 2017.\nLOW-CARBON PATHWAY. The Pacific Northwest and NW Natural are deeply committed to a clean energy future. In 2017, we will continue pursuing opportunities for carbon emission savings for both our Company and the greater region. Driving greater emission reductions over time will require leveraging our modern pipeline systems in new ways, working closely with customers, policymakers and regulators, and embracing cutting-edge technology. In 2017, we will explore ways to reduce the carbon intensity of our product with plans to also help our customers reduce and offset their consumption, and support our communities' efforts to replace more carbon intensive fuels with natural gas.\nSTRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. We remain focused on creating value in all our businesses. For our utility business, we are investing in the expansion of our Mist gas storage facility to provide innovative no-notice gas storage service for a single customer who will use the reliability of natural gas to integrate more intermittent renewable energy - like solar and wind - into the energy grid. We are pleased to be supporting the elimination of coal-fired electric generation renewables with this unique service. In addition, we remain focused on our non-utility businesses, including our gas storage business, and identifying higher value customers, enhanced service offerings, and seeking to capitalize on opportunities that fit our business-risk profile.\nDIVIDENDS\nDividend highlights include:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.47 cents per share, payable on February 15, 2017, to shareholders of record on January 31, 2017, reflecting an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.88 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRegulatory Matters\nRegulation and Rates\nUTILITY. Our utility business is subject to regulation by the OPUC, WUTC, and FERC with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service. The OPUC and WUTC also regulate the system of accounts and issuance of securities by our utility. In 2016, approximately 89% of our utility gas customers were located in Oregon, with the remaining 11% in Washington. Earnings and cash flows from utility operations are largely determined by rates set in general rate cases and other proceedings in Oregon and Washington. They are also affected by the local economies in Oregon and Washington, the pace of customer growth in the residential, commercial, and industrial markets, and our ability to remain price competitive, control expenses, and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery of our utility-related costs, including operating expenses and investment costs in utility plant and other regulatory assets. See \"Most Recent General Rate Cases\" below.\nGAS STORAGE. Our gas storage business is subject to regulation by the OPUC, WUTC, CPUC, and FERC with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service. The OPUC and CPUC also regulate the issuance of securities, system of accounts, and regulate intrastate storage services. The FERC regulates interstate storage services. The FERC uses a maximum cost of service model which allows for gas storage prices to be set at or below the cost of service as approved by each agency in the last regulatory filing. The OPUC Schedule 80 rates are tied to the FERC rates, and are updated whenever we modify our FERC maximum rates. The CPUC regulates Gill Ranch under a market-based rate model which allows for the price of storage services to be set by the marketplace. In 2016, approximately 69% of our storage revenues were derived from FERC, Oregon, and Washington regulated operations and approximately 31% from California operations.\nMost Recent General Rate Cases\nOREGON. Effective November 1, 2012, the OPUC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 9.5%, an overall rate of return of 7.78%, and a capital structure of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt.\nWASHINGTON. Effective January 1, 2009, the WUTC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 10.1% and an overall rate of return of 8.4% with a capital structure\nof 51% common equity, 5% short-term debt, and 44% long-term debt.\nFERC. We are required under our Mist interstate storage certificate authority and rate approval orders to file every five years either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for our interstate storage services. In December 2013, we filed a rate petition, which was approved in 2014, and allows for the maximum cost-based rates for our interstate gas storage services. These rates were effective January 1, 2014, with the rate changes having no significant impact on our revenues.\nWe continuously monitor the utility and evaluate the need for a rate case. Currently, we are contemplating filing an Oregon rate case in late 2017 or in 2018 with a Washington rate case thereafter.\nRegulatory Proceeding Updates\nDuring 2016, we were involved in the regulatory activities discussed below.\nENVIRONMENTAL COST DEFERRAL AND SITE REMEDIATION AND RECOVERY MECHANISM (SRRM). In February 2015, as part of the implementation of the SRRM, the OPUC issued an Order (2015 Order) requiring us to forego collection of $15 million out of approximately $95 million in total environmental remediation expenses and associated carrying costs we had deferred through 2012 based on the OPUC's determination of how an earnings test should apply to amounts deferred from 2003 to 2012, with adjustments for other factors the OPUC deemed relevant. As a result, we recognized a $15.0 million non-cash charge in operations and maintenance expense in the first quarter of 2015. Also, as a result of the 2015 Order, we recognized $5.3 million pre-tax of interest income related to the equity earnings on our deferred environmental expenses in the first quarter of 2015.\nIn addition, the OPUC issued a subsequent Order regarding our SRRM (2016 order) in January 2016 in which the OPUC: (1) disallowed the recovery of $2.8 million of interest earned on the previously disallowed environmental expenditure amounts; (2) clarified the state allocation of 96.68% of environmental remediation costs for all environmental sites to Oregon; and (3) confirmed our treatment of $13.8 million of expenses put into the SRRM amortization account was correct and in compliance with prior OPUC orders. As a result of the 2016 Order, we recognized a $3.3 million non-cash charge, of which $2.8 million is reflected in other income and expense, net and $0.5 million is included in operations and maintenance expense. Our compliance filing related to the 2016 Order was filed with the OPUC on March 11, 2016. We do not expect any further action by the OPUC related to that filing. See Note 15 regarding our SRRM.\nSYSTEM INTEGRITY PROGRAM (SIP). We filed a request to extend the SIP program in the fourth quarter of 2014. The OPUC considered our renewal request at a public meeting in March 2015 and suspended our filing and ordered additional process, including involvement of other gas utilities in the state, before making a final decision. In 2016, we withdrew our request to extend the SIP program and\ninstead focused our efforts on establishing guidelines for future safety cost trackers with the OPUC. An all-party agreement was filed with the OPUC on October 10, 2016 and is currently under review. We expect resolution of this docket in the first half of 2017.\nHEDGING. In 2014 the OPUC opened a docket to discuss broader gas hedging practices across gas utilities in Oregon. This docket was divided into two phases. The first phase was focused on an analytical review of hedging and hedging practices. We are currently working through the second phase regarding potential hedging guidelines, and seeking an agreement through discussions with the parties. After the second phase is complete, a status report or other filing will be submitted to the OPUC, and the remainder of the process will be determined at that time. Currently, we anticipate resolution of the docket in the second half of 2017.\nThe WUTC is also conducting an investigation into the hedging practices of gas utilities operating in Washington, and considering whether it should require gas utilities to implement certain practices related to hedging. The WUTC received comments from all parties in the first half of 2016 and continues to review the comments and docket. After the WUTC completes their review, they will determine next steps in the docket.\nINTERSTATE STORAGE AND OPTIMIZATION SHARING. We received an Order from the OPUC in March 2015 on their review of the current revenue sharing arrangement that allocates a portion of the net revenues generated from non-utility Mist storage services and third-party asset management services to utility customers. The Order requires a third-party cost study to be performed and the results of the cost study may initiate a new docket or the re-opening of the original docket. In January 2017, all parties agreed and selected a third-party consultant to perform the study and are continuing to facilitate completion of the work directed by the OPUC.\nCARBON SOLUTIONS PROGRAM. Oregon Senate Bill 844 (SB 844) required the OPUC to develop rules and programs to reduce carbon emissions in Oregon. In June 2015, we submitted our first project related to Combined Heat and Power (CHP) for OPUC approval. The submitted CHP program would pay owners of new commercial- and industrial-scale CHP systems for verified carbon emission reductions. In April 2016, the OPUC issued an order declining our program as submitted and provided guidance on program structure for potential future submissions. We have worked with the stakeholders to reach common ground and are contemplating our next steps for this program.\nWEATHER NORMALIZATION MECHANISM (WARM). In Oregon, WARM is applied to residential and commercial customers' bills to adjust for temperature variances from average weather. In 2015, the OPUC initiated a review of the WARM mechanism as a result of customer complaints received related to surcharges applied under the WARM mechanism due to the record warm weather in our service territory during the 2014-15 winter. In May 2016, we filed a stipulation among the parties to resolve the issues identified in the review. In June 2016, the OPUC issued an order\nadopting the stipulation, which included modest changes to the WARM mechanism. The most notable change relates to the timing of collection of any unbilled WARM amounts, due to operation of certain caps on monthly bills in the program. Previously, any unbilled WARM amounts deferred through the WARM period were billed to customers in June. Under the adjusted WARM mechanism, the collections of any unbilled WARM amounts will continue to be deferred and will earn a carrying charge until collected in the PGA the following year. These changes do not reduce the value WARM provides to us or our customers in mitigating the impact from variations in weather.\nINTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN (IRP). We filed our 2016 Oregon and Washington IRPs on August 26, 2016. We received a letter of compliance from the WUTC, in December of 2016, in relation to our IRP in Washington and acknowledgment by the OPUC in February of 2017. The IRP included analysis of different growth scenarios and corresponding resource acquisition strategies. The analysis is needed to develop supply and demand resource requirements, consider uncertainties in the planning process, and to establish a plan for providing reliable and low cost natural gas service.\nGAS INCIDENT INVESTIGATION. On October 19, 2016, there was a natural gas explosion in Portland, Oregon after a third-party contractor damaged a NW Natural service line. The contractor was not working for NW Natural at the time. NW Natural and local authorities responded to the event and evacuated the necessary building prior to the ignition. No fatalities or life-threatening injuries were sustained. NW Natural is assisting the OPUC with an investigation regarding the incident.\nDEPRECIATION STUDY. Under OPUC regulations, the utility is required to file a depreciation study every five years to update or justify maintaining the existing depreciation rates. In December 2016, we filed the required depreciation study with the Commission and it is currently under review. We do not anticipate the study to materially change our current depreciation rates.\nHOLDING COMPANY APPLICATION. In February 2017, we filed applications with the OPUC, WUTC, and CPUC for approval to reorganize under a holding company structure. As one of only two local distribution companies remaining without a holding company structure, we recognize the advantages and flexibility inherent in such a structure and are exploring the possibility of such a reorganization. The filing of regulatory applications is the first of many steps required to form a holding company. We expect that the regulatory process will take six to nine months, and will result in the OPUC, WUTC and CPUC authorizing a holding company structure subject to certain restrictions, or \"ring-fencing\" provisions applicable to NW Natural, the entity that currently, and would continue to, house our utility operations. Once regulatory conditions and approvals are obtained, our Board of Directors will evaluate the desirability of a holding company structure in light of the conditions imposed. If supported by the Board of Directors, we would then submit the proposed corporate reorganization to our shareholders for approval. If approved by the shareholders, corporate filings would be made that would create the holding company, with the shareholders immediately prior to\nthe reorganization owning the same relative percentages of the holding company as they own of NW Natural immediately prior to the reorganization. The structure currently contemplated involves placing a non-operating corporate entity over our existing consolidated structure. If we were to determine that this reorganization were not desirable at any point in the process, the corporation reorganization would not proceed. We do not expect a material operational or financial impact to our business as a result of the contemplated reorganization.\nRate Mechanisms\nPURCHASED GAS ADJUSTMENT. Rate changes are established for the utility each year under PGA mechanisms in Oregon and Washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases. This includes gas costs under spot purchases as well as contract supplies, gas costs hedged with financial derivatives, gas costs from the withdrawal of storage inventories, the production of gas reserves, interstate pipeline demand costs, temporary rate adjustments, which amortize balances of deferred regulatory accounts, and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year.\nWe filed our PGA in September 2016 and received OPUC and WUTC approval in October 2016. PGA rate changes were effective November 1, 2016. The rate changes decreased the average monthly bills of residential customers by approximately 2.6% and 1.5% in Oregon and Washington, respectively. The decrease in Oregon reflects customers' portion of adjustments for changes in wholesale natural gas costs, offset by adjustments related to the decoupling mechanism, environmental costs, and additional annual adjustments based on ongoing orders with the OPUC. Washington rates reflected the effect of changes in wholesale natural gas costs, offset by slight increases in certain energy efficiency programs. In addition, we credited $19.4 million to customers in June 2016 for their portion of the gas cost sharing incentive for the 2015-2016 gas year, resulting from lower than projected gas costs, which were driven by warmer than normal weather, lower volume usage, and lower market prices.\nEach year, we typically hedge gas prices on approximately 75% of our utility's annual sales requirement based on normal weather, including both physical and financial hedges. We entered the 2016-17 gas year (November 1, 2016 - October 31, 2017) hedged at 75% of our forecasted sales volumes, including 48% in financial swap and option contracts and 27% in physical gas supplies. .\nIn addition to the amount hedged for the current gas contract year, we are also hedged in future years at approximately 26% for the 2017-18 gas year and between 4% and 18% for annual requirements over the subsequent five gas years as of December 31, 2016. Our hedge levels are subject to change based on actual load volumes, which depend to a certain extent on weather, economic conditions, and estimated gas reserve production. Also, our gas storage inventory levels may increase or decrease with storage expansion, changes in storage contracts with third parties, variations in the heat content of the gas, and/or storage recall by the utility.\nUnder the current PGA mechanism in Oregon, there is an incentive sharing provision whereby we are required to select each year an 80% deferral or a 90% deferral of higher or lower actual gas costs compared to estimated PGA prices, such that the impact on current earnings from the incentive sharing is either 20% or 10% of the difference between actual and estimated gas costs, respectively. For the 2015-16 and 2016-17 gas years, we selected the 80% and 90% deferral option, respectively. Under the Washington PGA mechanism, we defer 100% of the higher or lower actual gas costs, and those gas cost differences are passed on to customers through the annual PGA rate adjustment.\nEARNINGS TEST REVIEW. We are subject to an annual earnings review in Oregon to determine if the utility is earning above its authorized ROE threshold. If utility earnings exceed a specific ROE level, then 33% of the amount above that level is required to be deferred or refunded to customers. Under this provision, if we select the 80% deferral gas cost option, then we retain all of our earnings up to 150 basis points above the currently authorized ROE. If we select the 90% deferral option, then we retain all of our earnings up to 100 basis points above the currently authorized ROE. For the 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17 periods, we selected the 90%, 80%, and 90% deferral option, respectively. The ROE threshold is subject to adjustment annually based on movements in long-term interest rates. For calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016, the ROE threshold was 10.66%, 10.60%, and 11.06%, respectively. There were no refunds required for 2014 and 2015. We do not expect a refund for 2016 based on our results and anticipate filing the 2016 earnings test in May 2017.\nGAS RESERVES. In 2011, the OPUC approved the Encana gas reserves transaction to provide long-term gas price protection for our utility customers and determined our costs under the agreement would be recovered, on an ongoing basis through our annual PGA mechanism. Gas produced from our interests is sold at then prevailing market prices, and revenues from such sales, net of associated operating and production costs and amortization, are included in our cost of gas. The cost of gas, including a carrying cost for the rate base investment made under the original agreement, is included in our annual Oregon PGA filing, which allows us to recover these costs through customer rates. Our net investment under the original agreement earns a rate of return.\nIn March 2014, we amended the original gas reserves agreement in response to Encana's sale of its interest in the Jonah field located in Wyoming to Jonah Energy. Under our amended agreement with Jonah Energy, we have the option to invest in additional wells on a well-by-well basis with drilling costs and resulting gas volumes shared at our amended proportionate working interest for each well in which we invest. We elected to participate in some of the additional wells drilled in 2014, but did not have the opportunity to participate in additional wells in 2015 and 2016. In the future, we may have the opportunity to participate in additional wells. Volumes produced from the additional wells drilled in 2014 are included in our Oregon PGA at a fixed rate of $0.4725\nDECOUPLING. In Oregon, we have a decoupling mechanism. Decoupling is intended to break the link between utility earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by customers, removing any financial incentive by the utility to discourage customers' efforts to conserve energy.\nThe Oregon decoupling mechanism was reauthorized and the baseline expected usage per customer was set in the 2012 Oregon general rate case. This mechanism employs a use-per-customer decoupling calculation, which adjusts margin revenues to account for the difference between actual and expected customer volumes. The margin adjustment resulting from differences between actual and expected volumes under the decoupling component is recorded to a deferral account, which is included in the annual PGA filing. In Washington, customer use is not covered by such a tariff. See \"Business Segments-Local Gas Distribution Utility Operations\" below.\nWARM. In Oregon, we have an approved weather normalization mechanism, which is applied to residential and commercial customer bills. This mechanism is designed to help stabilize the collection of fixed costs by adjusting residential and commercial customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather, with rate decreases when the weather is colder than average and rate increases when the weather is warmer than average. The mechanism is applied to bills from December through May of each heating season. The mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers' rates to reflect average weather, which uses the 25-year average temperature for each day of the billing period. Daily average temperatures and 25-year average temperatures are based on a set point temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit for residential customers and 58 degrees Fahrenheit for commercial customers. This weather normalization mechanism was reauthorized in the 2012 Oregon general rate case without an expiration date. Residential and commercial customers in Oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism, and as of December 31, 2016, 9% of total customers had opted out. We do not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for residential and commercial Washington customers, which account for about 11% of total customers. See \"Business Segments-Local Gas Distribution Utility Operations\" below.\nINDUSTRIAL TARIFFS. The OPUC and WUTC have approved tariffs covering utility service to our major industrial customers, including terms, which are intended to give us certainty in the level of gas supplies we need to acquire to serve this customer group. The terms include, among other things, an annual election period, special pricing provisions for out-of-cycle changes, and a requirement that industrial customers complete the term of their service election under our annual PGA tariff.\nENVIRONMENTAL COST DEFERRAL AND SRRM. In Oregon, we have a SRRM through which we track and have the ability to recover prudently incurred past deferred and future environmental remediation costs allocable to Oregon, subject to an earnings test.\nThe SRRM defines three classes of deferred environmental remediation expense:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pre-review - This class of costs represents remediation spend that has not yet been deemed prudent by the\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOPUC. Carrying costs on these remediation expenses are recorded at our authorized cost of capital. We anticipate the prudence review for annual costs and approval of the earnings test prescribed by the OPUC to occur by the third quarter of the following year.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Post-review - This class of costs represents remediation spend that has been deemed prudent and allowed after applying the earnings test, but is not yet included in amortization. We earn a carrying cost on these amounts at a rate equal to the five-year treasury rate plus 100 basis points.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Amortization - This class of costs represents amounts included in current customer rates for collection and is generally calculated as one-fifth of the post-review deferred balance. We earn a carrying cost equal to the amortization rate determined annually by the OPUC, which approximates a short-term borrowing rate. We included $10.0 million of deferred remediation expense approved by the OPUC for collection during the 2016-2017 PGA year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe SRRM earnings test is an annual review of our adjusted utility ROE compared to our authorized utility ROE, which is currently 9.5%. To apply the earnings test first we must determine what if any costs are subject to the test through the following calculation: Table 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual spend\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: $5 million base rate rider(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Prior year carry-over(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> $5 million insurance + interest on insurance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deferred annual spend subject to earnings test\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: over-earnings adjustment, if any\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: deferred interest on annual spend(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amount transferred to post-review\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Base rate rider went into Oregon customer rates beginning\n</td> </tr>\n</table> November 1, 2015.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Prior year carry-over results when the prior year amount transferred to post-review is negative. The negative amount is carried over to offset annual spend in the following year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Deferred interest is added to annual spend to the extent the spend is recoverable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the adjusted utility ROE is greater than the authorized utility ROE, then we could be required to expense amounts in excess of authorized ROE.\nFor 2016, we have performed this test, which we anticipate submitting to the OPUC in May 2017, and we do not expect an earnings test adjustment for 2016.\nThe WUTC has also previously authorized the deferral of environmental costs, if any, that are appropriately allocated to Washington customers. This Order was effective in January 2011 with cost recovery and a carrying charge to be determined in a future proceeding.\nPENSION COST DEFERRAL AND PENSION BALANCING ACCOUNT. Effective January 1, 2011, the OPUC approved our request to defer annual pension expenses above the amount set in rates, with recovery of these deferred amounts through the implementation of a balancing account, which includes the expectation of higher and lower pension expenses in future years. Our recovery of these\ndeferred balances includes accrued interest on the account balance at the utility's authorized rate of return, which is currently 7.78%. Future years' deferrals will depend on changes in plan assets and projected benefit liabilities based on a number of key assumptions, and our pension contributions. Pension expense deferrals, excluding interest, were $6.3 million, $8.2 million, and $4.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" below.\nINTERSTATE STORAGE AND OPTIMIZATION SHARING. On an annual basis, we credit amounts to Oregon and Washington customers as part of our regulatory incentive sharing mechanism related to net revenues earned from Mist gas storage and asset management activities. Generally amounts are credited to Oregon customers in June, while credits are given to customers in Washington through reductions in rates through the annual PGA filing in November.\nThe following table presents the credits to customers: Table 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oregon utility\ncustomer credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Washington utility customer credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Segments - Local Gas Distribution Utility Operations\nUtility margin results are primarily affected by customer growth, revenues from rate-base additions, and, to a certain extent, by changes in delivered volumes due to weather and customers' gas usage patterns because a significant portion of our utility margin is derived from natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers. In Oregon, we have a conservation tariff (also called the decoupling mechanism), which adjusts utility margin up or down each month through a deferred regulatory accounting adjustment designed to offset changes resulting from increases or decreases in average use by residential and commercial customers. We also have a weather normalization tariff in Oregon, WARM, which adjusts customer bills up or down to offset changes in utility margin resulting from above- or below-average temperatures during the winter heating season. Both mechanisms are designed to reduce the volatility of customer bills and our utility's earnings.

Under the sales service, the customer buys the gas commodity from the utility. Under the transportation service, the customer buys the gas commodity directly from a third-party gas marketer or supplier. Our gas commodity cost is primarily a pass-through cost to customers; therefore, our profit margins are not materially affected by an industrial customer's decision to purchase gas from us or from third parties. Industrial and large commercial customers may also select between firm and interruptible service options, with firm services generally providing higher profit margins compared to interruptible services. To help manage gas supplies, our industrial tariffs are designed to provide some certainty regarding industrial customers' volumes by requiring an annual service election which becomes effective November 1, special charges for changes between elections, and in some cases, a minimum or maximum volume requirement before changing options.\nIndustrial sales and transportation highlights include:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes (therms):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial - firm sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial - firm transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial - interruptible sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial - interruptible transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total volumes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>475.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>472.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility margin:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial - sales and transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 COMPARED TO 2015.

The OPUC and WUTC generally require natural gas commodity costs to be billed to customers at the actual cost incurred, or expected to be incurred, by the utility. Customer rates are set each year so that if cost estimates were met we would not earn a profit or incur a loss on gas commodity purchases; however, in Oregon we have an incentive sharing mechanism which has been described under \"Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Purchased Gas Adjustment\" above. In addition to the PGA incentive sharing mechanism, gains and losses from hedge contracts entered into after annual PGA rates are effective for Oregon customers are also required to be shared and therefore may impact net income. Further, we also have a regulatory agreement whereby we earn a rate of return on our investment in the gas reserves acquired under the original agreement with Encana and include gas from our amended gas reserves agreement at a fixed rate of $0.4725 per therm, which are also reflected in utility margin.

Cost of gas decreased $66.7 million, or 20%, reflecting lower natural gas prices and resulting in a $19.4 million credit to customers, partially offset by a 5% increase in volumes mainly from comparatively colder weather in the first quarter and December 2016.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014. Cost of gas decreased $38.2 million, or 10% primarily due to an 8% decrease in sales volume reflecting warmer weather during the year as well as a 2% decrease in average cost of gas reflecting lower market prices for natural gas.\nThe effect on net income from our gas cost incentive sharing mechanism resulted in a margin gain of $4.0 million and $3.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, as prices were lower due to warmer than average weather. During the extreme cold weather event in February 2014, we experienced a record sendout and consequently, the higher volumes of gas purchased at that time resulted in a margin loss of $2.1 million. For a discussion of our gas cost incentive sharing mechanism, see Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Purchased Gas Adjustment\u201d above.\nBusiness Segments - Gas Storage\nOur gas storage segment primarily consists of the non-utility portion of our Mist underground storage facility in Oregon and our 75% undivided ownership interest in the Gill Ranch underground storage facility in California.\nAt Mist, we provide gas storage services to customers in the interstate and intrastate markets using storage capacity that has been developed in advance of core utility customers' requirements. We also contract with an independent energy marketing company to provide asset management services using our utility and non-utility storage and transportation capacity, the results of which are included in the gas storage business segment. Pre-tax income from gas storage at Mist and asset management services is subject to revenue sharing with core utility customers. Under this regulatory incentive sharing mechanism, we retain 80% of pre-tax income from Mist gas storage services and asset management services when the underlying costs of the capacity being used are not included in our utility rates, and 33% of pre-tax income from such storage and asset management services when the capacity being used is included in utility rates. The remaining 20% and 67%, respectively, are credited to a deferred regulatory account for credit to our core utility customers. See \"Regulatory Matters-Regulatory Proceeding Updates\" above for information regarding an open docket related to this incentive sharing mechanism.\nOur 75% undivided ownership interest in the Gill Ranch facility is held by our wholly-owned subsidiary Gill Ranch, LLC, which is also the operator of the facility. Our portion of the facility is 15 Bcf of gas storage capacity. We also contract with an independent energy marketing company to provide asset management services at Gill Ranch.

Over the past few years, market prices for natural gas storage, particularly in California, were negatively affected by the abundant supply of natural gas, low volatility of natural gas prices, and surplus gas storage capacity. We have completed our contracting for the 2016-17 gas storage year and have seen a slight improvement in pricing compared to the 2015-16 gas storage year.\nThough prices for the 2015-16 and 2016-17 gas years have shown slight improvements at our Gill Ranch facility, they remain low relative to the pricing in our original long-term contracts, which ended primarily in the 2013-14 gas storage year. In the future, we may see continued price improvement or an increase in the demand for natural gas driven by a number of factors, including changes in electric generation triggered by California's renewable portfolio standards, an increase in use of alternative fuels to meet carbon emission reduction targets, recovery of the California economy, growth of domestic industrial manufacturing, potential exports of liquefied natural gas from the west coast, and other favorable storage market conditions in and around California. These factors, if they occur, may contribute to higher summer/winter natural gas price spreads, gas price volatility, and gas storage values. However, given the continued lower market prices, we are exploring a number of strategic options including opportunities to provide services to higher value customers and also seek to capitalize on opportunities that fit our business-risk profile.\nIn October 2015, a significant natural gas leak occurred at an unaffiliated southern California gas storage facility that persisted into early 2016. At this time, we do not know the long-term effects of this incident on gas storage prices. In September 2016, legislation was passed and signed into law by the Governor of California in response to the incident, which directed the California Department of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) to develop new regulations for gas storage wells. While the regulations are\nstill under development and their ultimate impact is unknown, it is likely that the pending DOGGR regulations and finalized PHMSA gas storage regulations will result in higher costs for all storage providers. The potential costs of compliance could include one-time capital expenditures and/or ongoing operations and maintenance costs. As a result of the legislation and pending regulations, the nature of, and demand for, future storage contracts, as well as market values in California could be impacted and remain uncertain at this time.\nIf such new regulation and legislation require significant capital and on-going spending to upgrade or maintain the facility, we are unsuccessful in identifying new higher value customers, future storage values do not improve, an increased demand and other favorable market conditions for natural gas storage do not materialize, and/or volatility does not return to the gas storage market, this could have a negative impact on our future cash flows and could result in impairment of our Gill Ranch gas storage facility, which had a net book value of $196.9 million at December 31, 2016. We continue to assess these conditions along with other strategic alternatives and their impact on the value of the asset on an ongoing basis. Refer to Note 2 for more information regarding our accounting policy for impairment of long-lived assets.\nOther\nOther primarily consists of NNG Financial's equity investment in KB Pipeline, an equity investment in TWH, which has invested in the Trail West pipeline project, and other miscellaneous non-utility investments and business activities.

These initiatives resulted in approximately $5 million of operations and maintenance expense savings during 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nDelinquent customer receivable balances continue to remain at historically low levels. The utility's bad debt expense as a percent of revenues was 0.1% for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIn addition to fluctuations in operations and maintenance expense reported above, we have OPUC approval to defer certain utility pension costs in excess of what is currently recovered in customer rates. This pension cost deferral is recorded to a regulatory balancing account, which stabilizes the amount of operations and maintenance expense each year. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we deferred pension expenses totaling $6.3 million, $8.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. As a result, increased pension costs had a minimal effect on operations and maintenance expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014, with the increase principally related to the costs allocated to our Washington operations, which are not covered by the pension balancing account. For further explanation of the pension balancing account, see Note 8 and Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Pension Cost Deferral and Prepaid Pension Assets,\u201d above for further explanation of the pension balancing account.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization highlights include:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 COMPARED TO 2015.

The increase in the effective income tax rate is due to lower benefits of depletion deductions from our gas reserves activity.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014. The decrease in the effective income tax rate reflects the benefits of depletion deductions from our gas reserves activity.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCapital Structure\nOne of our long-term goals is to maintain a strong consolidated capital structure, generally consisting of 45% to 50% common stock equity and 50% to 55% long-term and short-term debt, and with a target utility capital structure of 50% common stock and 50% long-term debt. When additional capital is required, debt or equity securities are issued depending on both the target capital structure and market conditions. These sources of capital are also used to fund long-term debt retirements and short-term commercial paper maturities. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and Note 7.\nAchieving the target capital structure and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings and provide access to capital markets at reasonable costs. Our consolidated capital structure was as follows: Table 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common stock equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, changes to our capital structure were primarily due to issuances of long-term debt instruments and our equity issuance. The net proceeds from these issuances will be used for general corporate purposes, primarily to fund our ongoing utility construction programs and reduce our short-term debt. See further discussion below in \"Cash Flows - Financing Activities\".\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2016 we had $3.5 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $4.2 million at December 31, 2015. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity during periods when capital markets are volatile, we may elect to maintain higher cash balances and add short-term borrowing capacity. In addition, we may also pre-fund utility capital expenditures when long-term fixed rate environments are attractive. As a regulated entity, our issuance of equity securities and most forms of debt securities are subject to approval by the OPUC and WUTC. Our use of retained earnings is not subject to those same restrictions.\nFor the utility segment, the short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder winter months when the utility borrows money to cover the lag between natural gas purchases and bill collections from customers. Our short-term liquidity for the utility is primarily provided by cash balances, internal cash flow from operations, proceeds\nfrom the sale of commercial paper notes, as well as available cash from multi-year credit facilities, short-term credit facilities, company-owned life insurance policies, the sale of long-term debt, and issuances of equity. Utility long-term debt and equity issuance proceeds are primarily used to finance utility capital expenditures, refinance maturing debt of the utility, and provide temporary funding for other general corporate purposes of the utility.\nBased on our current debt ratings (see \"Credit Ratings\" below), we have been able to issue commercial paper and long-term debt at attractive rates and have not needed to borrow or issue letters of credit from our back-up credit facility. In the event we are not able to issue new debt due to adverse market conditions or other reasons, we expect our near-term liquidity needs can be met using internal cash flows or, for the utility segment, drawing upon our committed credit facility. We also have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC for the issuance of secured and unsecured debt or equity securities, subject to market conditions and certain regulatory approvals. As of December 31, 2016, we have Board authorization to issue up to $175 million of additional FMBs. We also have OPUC approval to issue up to $175 million of additional long-term debt for approved purposes.\nIn the event our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings are downgraded, or our outstanding derivative position exceeds a certain credit threshold, our counterparties under derivative contracts could require us to post cash, a letter of credit, or other forms of collateral, which could expose us to additional cash requirements and may trigger increases in short-term borrowings while we were in a net loss position. We were not near the threshold for posting collateral at December 31, 2016. However, if the credit risk-related contingent features underlying these contracts were triggered on December 31, 2016, assuming our long-term debt ratings dropped to non-investment grade levels, we would not have been required to post collateral with our counterparties. See \"Credit Ratings\" below and Note 13.\nOther items that may have a significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources include pension contribution requirements, expiration of bonus tax depreciation and environmental expenditures.\nPENSION CONTRIBUTIONS. We expect to make significant contributions to our company-sponsored defined benefit plan, which is closed to new employees, over the next several years until we are fully funded under the Pension Protection Act rules, including the new rules issued under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) and the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA). See \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Accounting for Pensions and Postretirement Benefits\" below.\nBONUS DEPRECIATION. Regarding income tax, 50 percent bonus depreciation was available for a large portion of our capital expenditures in 2014, 2015 and 2016 for both federal and Oregon. This reduced taxable income and provided cash flow benefits. The federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 became law on December 18, 2015 and extended federal bonus depreciation through 2019.\nENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES. Concerning environmental expenditures, we expect to continue using cash resources to fund our environmental liabilities. In 2015, we received an Order from the OPUC regarding our SRRM and began recovering amounts through utility rates in November 2015. In addition, the OPUC issued a subsequent Order regarding SRRM implementation in January 2016. See Note 15, and \"Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Environmental Costs\" above.\nGAS STORAGE. Short-term liquidity for the gas storage segment is supported by cash balances, internal cash flow from operations, equity contributions from its parent company, and, if necessary, additional external financing.\nThe amount and timing of our Gill Ranch facility's cash flows from year to year are uncertain, as the majority of these storage contracts are currently short-term. We have seen slightly higher contract prices for the 2015-16 and 2016-17 storage years, but overall prices are still lower than the long-term contracts that expired at the end of the 2013-14 storage year. While we expect continuing challenges for Gill Ranch in 2017, we do not anticipate material changes in our ability to access sources of cash for short-term liquidity.\nCONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY. Based on several factors, including our current credit ratings, our commercial paper program, current cash reserves, committed credit facilities, and our expected ability to issue long-term debt in the capital markets, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to meet anticipated near-term cash requirements, including all contractual obligations, investing, and financing activities discussed below.\nDIVIDEND POLICY. We have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock each year since stock was first issued to the public in 1951. Annual common stock dividend payments per share, adjusted for stock splits, have increased each year since 1956. The declarations and amount of future dividends will depend upon our earnings, cash flows, financial condition and other factors. The amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. Except for certain lease and purchase commitments, we have no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements. See \"Contractual Obligations\" below.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table shows our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 by maturity and type of obligation:\nTable 191:

In May 2014, our union employees ratified a new labor agreement (Joint Accord) that expires on November 30, 2019. The Joint Accord includes the following items: an average annualized compensation increase of 4% effective June 1, 2014, which includes a 7.9% wage increase to better reflect current market competitive wages, offset by a reduction in bonus pay opportunities for union employees; and a scheduled 3% wage increase effective December 1 each year thereafter, beginning in 2015 with the potential for up to an additional 3% per year based on wage inflation at or above 4%. The Joint Accord also maintains competitive health benefits, including a 15% to 20% premium cost sharing by employees, job flexibility, and other flexibility provisions for the Company.\nShort-Term Debt\nOur primary source of utility short-term liquidity is from the sale of commercial paper and bank loans. In addition to issuing commercial paper or bank loans to meet working capital requirements, including seasonal requirements to finance gas purchases and accounts receivable, short-term debt may also be used to temporarily fund utility capital requirements. Commercial paper and bank loans are periodically refinanced through the sale of long-term debt or equity securities. Our outstanding commercial paper, which is sold through two commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement, is supported by one or more unsecured revolving credit facilities. See Credit Agreements\u201d below.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, our utility had short-term debt outstanding of $53.3 million and $270.0 million, respectively. The effective interest rate on short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a short-term credit facility loan totaling $50 million, as a short-term bridge through our peak heating season, which was repaid on February 4, 2016.\nCredit Agreements\nWe have a $300 million credit agreement, with a feature that allows the Company to request increases in the total commitment amount, up to a maximum of $450 million. The maturity date of the agreement is December 20, 2019.\nAll lenders under the agreement are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2016 as follows:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lender rating, by category\n</td> <td>Loan Commitment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA/Aa\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A/A\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on credit market conditions, it is possible one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency; however, we do not believe this risk to be imminent due to the lenders' strong investment-grade credit ratings.\nOur credit agreement permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $100 million. Any principal and unpaid interest amounts owed on borrowings under the credit agreements is due and payable on or before the maturity date. There were no outstanding balances under this credit agreement at December 31, 2016 or 2015. The credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. We were in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2016 and 2015, with consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratios of 47.6% and 52.5%, respectively.\nThe agreement also requires us to maintain credit ratings with Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and notify the lenders of any change in our senior unsecured debt ratings or senior secured debt\nratings, as applicable, by such rating agencies. A change in our debt ratings by S&P or Moody's is not an event of\ndefault, nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement. Rather, interest rates on any loans outstanding under the credit agreements are tied to debt ratings and therefore, a change in the debt rating would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreements when ratings are changed. See \"Credit Ratings\" below.\nCredit Ratings\nOur credit ratings are a factor of our liquidity, potentially affecting our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market. Our credit ratings also have an impact on the cost of funds and the need to post collateral under derivative contracts. The following table summarizes our current debt ratings: Table 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial paper (short-term debt)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>P-2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior secured (long-term debt)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>AA-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior unsecured (long-term debt)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate credit rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratings outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe above credit ratings are dependent upon a number of factors, both qualitative and quantitative, and are subject to change at any time.

The amounts and timing of future contributions will depend on market interest rates and investment returns on the plans' assets. See Note 8.\nBonus depreciation of 50% has been available for federal and Oregon purposes in 2014, 2015 and 2016. This reduced taxable income and provided cash flow benefits. Bonus depreciation for 2014 and 2015 was not enacted until December 19, 2014 and December 18, 2015, respectively. In both cases it was extended retroactively back to January 1 of the respective year. As a result, estimated income tax payments were made throughout 2014 and 2015 without the benefit of bonus depreciation for the year. This delayed the cash flow benefit of bonus depreciation until refunds could be requested and received. We received refunds of federal income tax overpayments of $7.9 million and $2.0 million in during 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result of the Federal Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015, bonus depreciation is now enacted through 2019. Accordingly, we do not anticipate similar refunds from income tax overpayments related to bonus depreciation, in the near future.\nWe have lease and purchase commitments relating to our operating activities that are financed with cash flows from operations. For information on cash flow requirements related to leases and other purchase commitments, see Financial Condition-Contractual Obligations\u201d above and Note 14.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activity highlights include:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(136.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(115.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(144.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(139.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(120.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 COMPARED TO 2015. The $21.3 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher utility capital expenditures related to improvements at our Newport LNG facility in Oregon, additional infrastructure investments in Clark County, Washington, and capital expenditures for our North Mist gas storage expansion project.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014. The $29.0 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower contributions from our gas reserve investments, which decrease due to regular amortization, compared to 2014 as NW Natural ended its original drilling program with Encana in 2014.\nOver the five-year period 2017 through 2021, total utility capital expenditures are estimated to be between $850 and $950 million. This range includes the total estimated cost of our North Mist gas storage facility expansion, which is approximately $128 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had invested $21 million in the expansion. The majority of the North Mist capital expenditures, $80 million to $90 million, are expected in 2017, with the remaining investment in 2018. We anticipate placing the expansion into service for the winter of 2018-19. Our five-year capital expenditure range also includes estimated capital expenditures between $75 million to $85 million related to planned upgrades and refurbishments to storage facilities, including our existing liquefied natural gas facilities in Oregon and our Mist storage facility. In addition, we plan to spend approximately $20 million to upgrade distribution infrastructure in Clark\nCounty, Washington through 2019. The estimated level of utility capital expenditures through 2021 reflects assumptions for continued customer growth, technology investments, distribution system maintenance and improvements, and gas storage facilities maintenance. Most of the required funds are expected to be internally generated over the five-year period, with short-term and long-term debt and bridge financing providing liquidity.\nIncluded in the five year period, 2017 utility capital expenditures are estimated to be between $225 and $250 million, and non-utility capital investments of less than $5 million. Additional spend for gas storage and other investments during and after 2017 are expected to be paid from working capital and additional equity contributions from NW Natural as needed.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activity highlights include:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(86.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(71.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in short-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(216.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in common stock issued, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 COMPARED TO 2015. The $11.5 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher repayments of short term loans and commercial paper of $252 million, partially offset by proceeds from $150 million of long-term debt issued in December 2016 and $53 million of common stock issued in November 2016, along with a $35 million decrease in repayments of long-term debt as compared to 2015.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014. The $3.4 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to redeeming $20 million less debt in 2015 compared to 2014. Partially offsetting the increase was the issuance of $11.2 million less of net commercial paper and short-term loans in 2015 compared to 2014.\nPension Cost and Funding Status of Qualified Retirement Plans\nPension costs are determined in accordance with accounting standards for compensation and retirement benefits. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Pensions and Postretirement Benefits\u201d below. Pension expense for our qualified defined benefit plan, which is allocated between operations and maintenance expenses, capital expenditures, and the deferred regulatory balancing account, totaled $17.3 million in 2016, a decrease of $3.5 million from 2015. The fair market value of pension assets in this plan increased to $257.7 million at December 31, 2016 from $249.3 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was due to a return on plan assets of $12.6 million and $14.5 million in employer contributions, offset by benefit payments of $18.7 million.\nWe make contributions to the company-sponsored qualified defined benefit pension plan based on actuarial assumptions and estimates, tax regulations and funding\nrequirements under federal law. Our qualified defined benefit pension plan was underfunded by $165.8 million at December 31, 2016. We plan to make contributions during 2017 of $19.4 million. See Note 8 for further pension disclosures.\nRatios of Earnings to Fixed Charges\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our ratios of earnings to fixed charges, computed using the method outlined by the SEC, were 3.39, 3.00, and 3.13, respectively. For this purpose, earnings consist of net income before income taxes plus fixed charges, and fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness, the amortization of debt expense and discount or premium and the estimated interest portion of rentals charged to income. See Exhibit 12 for the detailed ratio calculation.\nContingent Liabilities\nLoss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting standards for contingencies. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below. At December 31, 2016, our total estimated liability related to environmental sites is $119.7 million. See Note 15 and \"Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Environmental Costs\" above.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, see Note 2.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles, including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management considers our critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and which require management's most difficult and subjective or complex judgments, including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if we reported under different conditions or used different assumptions. Our most critical estimates and judgments include accounting for:\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>regulatory accounting;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>derivative instruments and hedging activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pensions and postretirement benefits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>income taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>environmental contingencies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>impairment of long-lived assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement has discussed its current estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board. Within the context of our critical accounting policies and estimates, management is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. For a description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, see Note 2.\nRegulatory Accounting\nOur utility is regulated by the OPUC and WUTC, which establish the rates and rules governing utility services provided to customers, and, to a certain extent, set forth special accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions. In general, we use the same accounting principles as non-regulated companies reporting under GAAP. However, authoritative guidance for regulated operations (regulatory accounting) requires different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of such regulation. For example, we account for the cost of gas using a PGA deferral and cost recovery mechanism, which is submitted for approval annually to the OPUC and WUTC. See \"Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Purchased Gas Adjustment\" above. There are other expenses and revenues that the OPUC or WUTC may require us to defer for recovery or refund in future periods. Regulatory accounting requires us to account for these types of deferred expenses (or deferred revenues) as regulatory assets (or regulatory liabilities) on the balance sheet. When we are allowed to recover these regulatory assets from, or are required to refund regulatory liabilities to, customers, we recognize the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time we realize the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates charged to customers.\nThe conditions we must satisfy to adopt the accounting policies and practices of regulatory accounting include:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an independent regulator sets rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause our utility satisfies all three conditions, we continue to apply regulatory accounting to our utility operations. Future accounting changes, regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could require us to discontinue the application of regulatory accounting for some or all of our regulated businesses. This would require the write-off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers.\nBased on current accounting and regulatory competitive conditions, we believe it is reasonable to expect continued application of regulatory accounting for our utility activities. Further, it is reasonable to expect the recovery or refund of our regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 through future customer rates. If we should determine all or a portion of these regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting, then we would be required to write-off the net unrecoverable balances against earnings in the period such determination is made. The net balance in regulatory asset and liability accounts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were assets of $10.3 million and $70.7 million, respectively. See Note 2.\nRevenue Recognition\nUtility and non-utility revenues, which are derived primarily from the sale, transportation, and storage of natural gas, are recognized upon the delivery of gas commodity or services rendered to customers.\nAccrued Unbilled Revenue\nFor a description of our policy regarding accrued unbilled revenue for both the utility and non-utility revenues, see Note 2. The following table presents changes in key metrics if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at December 31 was adjusted up or down by 1%:\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Up 1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Down 1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unbilled revenue increase (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility margin increase (decrease)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income increase (decrease)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes impact of regulatory mechanisms including decoupling mechanism.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nOur gas acquisition and hedging policies set forth guidelines for using financial derivative instruments to support prudent risk management strategies. These policies specifically prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our utility's natural gas sales requirements. These contracts include swaps, options, and combinations of option contracts. We primarily use these derivative financial instruments to manage commodity price\nvariability. A small portion of our derivative hedging strategy involves foreign currency exchange contracts.\nDerivative instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. If certain regulatory conditions are met, then the derivative instrument fair value is recorded together with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability account pursuant to regulatory accounting (see Note 2, \"Industry Regulation\"), and no unrealized gain or loss is recognized in current income. The gain or loss from the fair value of a derivative instrument subject to regulatory deferral is included in the recovery from, or refund to, utility customers in future periods (see \"Regulatory Accounting\", above). If a derivative contract is not subject to regulatory deferral, then the accounting treatment for unrealized gains and losses is recorded in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging (see Note 2, \"Derivatives\u201d and \"Industry Regulation\") which is either in current income or in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI or AOCL). Our derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were measured at fair value using models or other market accepted valuation methodologies derived from observable market data. Our estimate of fair value may change significantly from period-to-period depending on market conditions and prices. These changes may have an impact on our results of operations, but the impact would largely be mitigated due to the majority of our derivative activities being subject to regulatory deferral treatment. For estimated fair value of unrealized gains and losses, see Note 13.\nThe following table summarizes the amount of gains and losses realized from commodity price transactions for the last three years:\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net utility gain (loss) on:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net gain (loss) realized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRealized gains and losses from commodity hedges shown above were recorded as decreases or increases to cost of gas, respectively, and were included in our annual PGA rates.\nPensions and Postretirement Benefits\nWe maintain a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, non-qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees, and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering certain non-union employees. We also have a qualified defined contribution plan (Retirement K Savings Plan) for all eligible employees. Only the qualified defined benefit pension plan and Retirement K Savings Plan have plan assets, which are held in qualified trusts to fund the respective retirement benefits. The qualified defined benefit retirement plan for union and non-union employees was closed to new participants several years ago. These plans are not available to employees at any of our subsidiary companies. Non-union and union employees hired or re-hired after December 31, 2006 and 2009, respectively, and\nemployees of NW Natural subsidiaries are provided an enhanced Retirement K Savings Plan benefit. The postretirement Welfare Benefit Plan for non-union employees was also closed to new participants several years ago.\nNet periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs (retirement benefit costs) and projected benefit obligations (benefit obligations) are determined using a number of key assumptions including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement ages, mortality rates and an expected long-term return on plan assets. See Note 8. These key assumptions have a significant impact on the pension amounts recorded and disclosed. Retirement benefit costs consist of service costs, interest costs, the amortization of actuarial gains, losses and prior service costs, the expected returns on plan assets and, in part, on a market-related valuation of assets, if applicable. The market-related asset valuation reflects differences between expected returns and actual investment returns, which we recognize over a three-year period or less from the year in which they occur, thereby reducing year-to-year volatility in retirement benefit costs.\nAccounting standards also require balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans in AOCI or AOCL, net of tax, based on the fair value of plan assets compared to the actuarial value of future benefit obligations. However, the retirement benefit costs related to our qualified defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are generally recovered in utility rates, which are set based on accounting standards for pensions and postretirement benefit expenses. We received approval from the OPUC to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability based on expected rate recovery, rather than including it as AOCI or AOCL under common equity. See \"Regulatory Accounting\" above and Note 2, \"Industry Regulation\".\nThe OPUC allows us to defer a portion of our pension expense above or below the amount set in rates to a regulatory balancing account on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2016, the cumulative amount deferred for future pension cost recovery was $50.9 million. The regulatory balancing account includes the recognition of accrued interest on the account balance at the utility's authorized rate of return, with the equity portion of this interest being deferred until amounts are collected in rates.\nA number of factors, as discussed above, are considered in developing pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. For the December 31, 2016 measurement date, we reviewed and updated the following key assumptions:\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions was 4.00% for 2016 and 4.21% for 2015, and our weighted-average discount rate assumptions for other postretirement benefits was 3.85% for 2016 and 4.00% for 2015. The rate assumptions were determined for each plan based on a matching of benchmark interest rates to the estimated cash flows, which reflect the timing and amount of future benefit payments. Benchmark interest rates are drawn from the Citigroup Above Median Curve, which consists of high quality\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nbonds rated AA- or higher by S&P or Aa3 or higher by Moody's;\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our expected annual rate of future compensation increases, which was revised from a range of 3.25% to 5.0% at December 31, 2015 to a range of 3.25% to 4.5% at December 31, 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our expected long-term return on qualified defined benefit plan assets, which remained unchanged at a rate of 7.50%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our mortality rate assumptions were updated from RP-2014 mortality tables for employees and healthy annuitants with a fully generational projection using scale MP-2014 to corresponding RP-2006 mortality tables using scale MP-2015, which partially offset increases in our projected benefit obligation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other key assumptions, which were based on actual plan experience and actuarial recommendations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2016, our net pension liability (benefit obligations less market value of plan assets) for the qualified defined benefit plan increased $3.3 million compared to 2015. The increase in our net pension liability is primarily due to the $11.7 million increase in our pension benefit obligation, offset by an increase of $8.4 million in plan assets. The liability for non-qualified plans increased $0.5 million, and the liability for other postretirement benefits decreased $1.7 million in 2016.\nWe determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio. In developing our expected return, we analyze historical actual performance and long-term return projections, which gives consideration to the current asset mix and our target asset allocation. As of December 31, 2016, the actual annualized returns on plan assets, net of management fees, for the past one-year, five-years, and 10-years were 5.7%, 6.4%, and 3.2%, respectively.\nWe believe our pension assumptions to be appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions. However, the following shows the sensitivity of our retirement benefit costs and benefit obligations to changes in certain actuarial assumptions:\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on 2016 Retirement Benefit Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Retirement\nBenefit Obligations at Dec. 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qualified defined benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-qualified plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other postretirement benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected long-term return on plan assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qualified defined benefit plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn July 2012, President Obama signed into law the MAP-21 Act. This legislation changed several provisions affecting pension plans, including temporary funding relief and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) premium\nincreases, which reduces the level of minimum required contributions in the near-term but generally increases contributions in the long-run as well as increasing the operational costs of running a pension plan. Prior to the MAP-21 Act, we were using interest rates based on a 24-month average yield of investment grade corporate bonds (also referred to as \"segment rate\") to calculate minimum contribution requirements. MAP-21 Act established a new minimum and maximum corridor for segment rates based on a 25-year average of bond yields, which is to be used in calculating contribution requirements. In August 2014, HATFA was signed and extends certain aspects of MAP-21 as well as modifies the phase-out periods for the limitations. As a result we anticipate lower contributions over the next five years with contributions increasing thereafter.\nIncome Taxes\nValuation Allowances\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider the available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The most significant deferred tax asset currently recorded is for alternative minimum tax credits. We have determined that we are more likely than not to realize all recorded deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016. See Note 9.\nUncertain Tax Benefits\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A tax benefit from a material uncertain tax position will only be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position, or some portion thereof, will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. We participate in the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under the CAP program the Company works with the IRS to identify and resolve material tax matters before the federal income tax return is filed each year. No reserves for uncertain tax benefits were recorded during 2016, 2015, or 2014. See Note 9.\nRegulatory Matters\nRegulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent we believe they will be recoverable from, or refunded to, customers in future rates. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had regulatory income tax assets of $43.0 million and $47.4 million, respectively, representing future rate recovery of deferred tax liabilities resulting from differences in utility plant financial statement and tax basis and utility plant removal costs. These deferred tax liabilities, and the associated regulatory income tax assets, are currently being recovered through customer rates. See Note 2.\nTax Legislation\nWhen significant proposed or enacted changes in income tax rules occur we consider whether there may be a material impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or whether the changes could\nmaterially affect existing assumptions used in making estimates of tax related balances.\nThe final tangible property regulations applicable to all taxpayers were issued on September 13, 2013 and were generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. In addition, procedural guidance related to the regulations was issued under which taxpayers may make accounting method changes to comply with the regulations. We have evaluated the regulations and do not anticipate any material impact. However, unit-of-property guidance applicable to natural gas distribution networks has not yet been issued and is expected in 2016. We will further evaluate the effect of these regulations after this guidance is issued, but believe our current method is materially consistent with the new regulations and do not expect these regulations to have a material effect on our financial statements.\nThe Federal Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 became law on December 18, 2015 and extended federal bonus depreciation through 2019. See \"Financial Conditions-Cash Flows\" above.\nEnvironmental Contingencies\nWe account for environmental liabilities in accordance with accounting standards under the loss contingency guidance when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Amounts recorded for environmental contingencies take numerous factors into consideration, including, among other variables, changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders, estimated remediation costs, interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, timing of payments, and the input of legal counsel and third-party experts. Accordingly, changes in any of these variables or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental liabilities. For a complete discussion of our environmental policy refer to Note 2. For a discussion of our current environmental sites and liabilities refer to Note 15 and \"Contingent Liabilities\" above. In addition, for information regarding the regulatory treatment of these costs and our regulatory recovery mechanism, see \"Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Environmental Costs\" above.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment of long-lived assets include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value or expected future cash flows of the asset, among others.\nWhen such factors are present, we assess the recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the asset will be recovered through expected future cash flows. An asset is determined to be impaired when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss for\nthe difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated using appropriate valuation methodologies, which may include an estimate of discounted cash flows.\nWe determined there were no long-lived asset impairments in 2016.\nIn 2015, our Gill Ranch Storage facility within our Gas Storage Segment was reviewed for impairment. This analysis demonstrated sufficient headroom, as the undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the carrying value of the asset and no impairment was indicated. There are no significant changes to the undiscounted cash flow assumptions or other triggering events requiring further assessment for impairment in 2016. The cash flows assume a recovery of storage pricing and the ability to contract with higher value customers. Accordingly, if new regulation and legislation require significant capital and on-going spending to upgrade or maintain the facility, we are unsuccessful in identifying new higher value customers, future storage values do not improve, increased demand and other favorable market correlations for natural gas storage do not materialize, and/or volatility does not return to the gas storage market, this could have a negative impact on our future cash flows and could result in impairment of our Gill Ranch gas storage facility, which had a net book value of $196.9 million at December 31, 2016. The Company continues to assess these conditions along with other strategic alternatives and their impact on the value of the asset on an ongoing basis.", "summary": "The report discusses Northwest Natural Gas Company's financial condition and results of operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is management's assessment of Northwest Natural Gas Company's (NW Natural or the Company) financial condition, including the principal factors that affect results of operations. The discussion refers to our consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. References in this discussion to \"Notes\" are to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nThe consolidated financial statements include NW Natural and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries including:\n \u2022 NW Natural Energy, LLC (NWN Energy); \n \u2022 NW Natural Gas Storage, LLC (NWN Gas Storage); \n \u2022 Gill Ranch Storage, LLC (Gill Ranch); \n \u2022 NNG Financial Corporation (NNG Financial); \n \u2022 Northwest Energy Corporation (Energy Corp); and \n \u2022 NWN Gas Reserves LLC (NWN Gas Reserves). \nWe operate in two primary reportable business segments: local gas distribution and gas storage. We also have other investments and business activities not specifically related to one of these two reporting segments, which we aggregate and report as other. We refer to our local gas distribution business as the utility, and our gas storage segment and other as non-utility. Our utility segment includes our NW Natural local gas distribution business, NWN Gas Reserves, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Corp, and the utility portion of our Mist underground storage facility in Oregon (Mist). Our gas storage segment includes NWN Gas Storage, which is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of NWN Energy, Gill Ranch, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NWN Gas Storage, the non-utility portion of Mist, and asset management services. Other includes NWN Energy's equity investment in Trail West Holding, LLC (TWH), which is pursuing the development of a proposed natural gas pipeline through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Trail West Pipeline, LLC (TWP), and NNG Financial's equity investment in Kelso-Beaver Pipeline (KB Pipeline). For a further discussion of our business segments and other, see Note 4.\nIn addition to presenting the results of operations and earnings amounts in total, certain financial measures are expressed in cents per share or exclude the after-tax regulatory disallowances related to the OPUC's 2015 and 2016 environmental orders, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We present net income and earnings per share (EPS) excluding the regulatory disallowances along with the U.S. GAAP measures to illustrate the magnitude of these disallowances on ongoing business and operational results. Although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income and earnings per share under U.S. GAAP, we believe the amount and nature of such disallowances make period to period comparisons of operations difficult or potentially confusing. Financial measures are expressed in cents per share as these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings, including income taxes. All references in this section to EPS are on the basis of diluted shares (see Note 3). We use such non-GAAP financial measures to analyze our financial performance because we believe they provide useful information to our investors and creditors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe manage our business and strategic initiatives with a long-term view of providing natural gas service safely and reliably to customers, working with regulators on key policy initiatives, and remaining focused on growing our business. See \"2017 Outlook\" below for more information. Highlights for the year include:\n \u2022 added over 10,700 customers during the past twelve months for a growth rate of 1.5% at December 31, 2016; \n \u2022 invested $140 million in our distribution system and facilities for growth and reliability, as well as for our North Mist gas storage expansion project; \n \u2022 received approval to begin construction of our $128 million North Mist gas storage expansion project with a target in-service date of the winter of 2018-19; \n \u2022 continued our legacy of excellent customer service with the highest residential customer satisfaction score among large utilities in the West and the second highest residential score in the nation in the 2016 J.D. Power Gas Utility Customer Satisfaction study; \n \u2022 ranked first in the West and posted the second highest score in the nation in the 2016 J.D. Powers' Gas Utility Business Customer Satisfaction Study; \n \u2022 reduced residential customer rates to the lowest level in 15 years with a rate reduction effective November 1, 2016, as well as a credit of $19.4 million to customers in June 2016; and \n \u2022 delivered increasing dividends for the 61st consecutive year. \nKey financial highlights include: \n(1) Regulatory environmental disallowance of $3.3 million in 2016 includes $2.8 million recorded in utility other income (expense), net and $0.5 million recorded in utility operations and maintenance expense. Regulatory environmental disallowance of $15.0 million in 2015 is recorded in utility operations and maintenance expense. Adjusted consolidated net income and EPS and adjusted ROE are non-GAAP financial measures based on the after-tax disallowance using the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 39.5%. EPS is calculated using 27.8 million, 27.4 million, and 27.2 million diluted shares for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\n2016 COMPARED TO 2015. Overall, consolidated net income increased $5.2 million. The increase was primarily due to the $9.1 million after-tax charge from 2015 and a $2.0 million after-tax charge in 2016 related to the regulatory disallowances associated with a February 2015 OPUC Order and subsequent Order in our SRRM docket. See additional disclosure in the table above.\nExcluding the impact of the non-cash charges from the SRRM docket in 2015 and 2016, adjusted consolidated net income decreased $1.9 million primarily due to the following factors:\n \u2022 a $7.0 million increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the second half of 2015 that did not recur in 2016; and \n \u2022 a $5.5 million decrease in other income (expense), net primarily related to the recognition of $5.3 million of equity earnings on deferred regulatory asset balances as a result of the 2015 OPUC Order; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $5.2 million increase in utility margin primarily due to customer growth and gains from gas cost incentive sharing; and \n \u2022 a $3.9 million increase in gas storage revenues largely due to higher revenues from our asset management \nagreements at both storage facilities and slightly higher contract values at our Gill Ranch facility for the 2016-17 gas year.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014. Overall, consolidated net income decreased $5.0 million primarily due to the $9.1 million after-tax charge related to the February 2015 OPUC Order previously discussed. Excluding the impact of this Order, adjusted consolidated net income increased $4.1 million primarily due to the following factors:\n \u2022 a $5.3 million increase in utility margin primarily due to customer growth and gas cost sharing, partially offset by the effects of warmer weather; and \n \u2022 a $5.8 million increase in other income (expense), net related to the recognition of equity earnings on deferred regulatory asset balances as a result of the OPUC SRRM Order; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $5.5 million increase in operations and maintenance expense mainly due to higher compensation and benefits expense; and \n \u2022 a $0.9 million decrease in gas storage operating revenues due to negative impacts of decreases in storage prices between the 2013-14 and 2014-15 gas years; and \n \u2022 a $1.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses due to additional utility capital expenditures. \n2017 OUTLOOK\nOur near-term outlook is centered on six long-term strategic objectives (1) delivering natural gas safely and reliably to our customers; (2) providing superior customer service; (3) working closely with policymakers and regulators to constructively meet the interests of all parties; (4) enabling continued utility growth; (5) leveraging the benefits of natural gas and our modern system to lead our region to a low-carbon future; and (6) strategically investing in our existing utility and gas storage businesses, as well as creating new ideas to drive future growth opportunities and to ensure long-term profitability.\nOur 2017 goals leverage our resources and history of innovation to continue meeting the evolving needs of customers, regulators, and shareholders.\n\nSAFETY AND RELIABILITY. Delivering natural gas safely and reliably to customers is our first priority. During 2017, we will maintain our vigilant focus on safety and emergency response training for our employees, third-party contractors, and local authorities. We will continue to strive to increase public awareness of natural gas safety and protocols to reduce damages to our critical infrastructure. Continued investment in our pipeline system and facilities is also planned to ensure reliability with multi-year projects at our LNG facilities and Mist storage facility, as well as system upgrades in high-growth areas such as Clark County, Washington. Finally, safety also includes our continuous maintenance of strong cybersecurity defenses and preparation for large-scale emergency events, such as seismic hazards in our region.\nSUPERIOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. NW Natural has a legacy of providing excellent customer service with consistently high rankings in the J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction studies and a long-standing dedication to continuous improvement. In 2017, we will continue evolving to meet our customers' changing expectations by examining our customer interactions and touchpoints as well as the technology supporting these processes. We expect this comprehensive effort to propel further use of our innovative online customer connection portal and the latest technology, providing customers with an enhanced experience while improving operational efficiencies.\nPOLICIES AND REGULATION. Constructive policies and regulation provide the best outcomes for both customers and shareholders. In 2017, we plan to work closely with policymakers and regulators to plan for growth of our utility, and evaluate the investments necessary for this growth in our IRP. Finally, we will continue working with the EPA and other stakeholders on an environmentally protective and cost effective clean-up for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site.\nUTILITY GROWTH. Natural gas is a preferred energy choice in our service territory due to its efficiency and affordability coupled with our exceptional service. In 2017, we will continue leveraging these key attributes to capitalize on our region's above-average economic growth. We remain focused on maintaining our strong market share in the single-family residential sector, as well as capturing new commercial customers. As our Portland, Oregon community continues to experience in-migration and greater urban density, multifamily housing construction continues to outpace historical levels. Seeing this trend, we have launched a comprehensive effort to make inroads in the multifamily market with streamlined infrastructure designs, engineering technical support, and incentives and promotional support for qualifying projects. We will continue pursuing this sector in 2017.\nLOW-CARBON PATHWAY. The Pacific Northwest and NW Natural are deeply committed to a clean energy future. In 2017, we will continue pursuing opportunities for carbon emission savings for both our Company and the greater region. Driving greater emission reductions over time will require leveraging our modern pipeline systems in new ways, working closely with customers, policymakers and regulators, and embracing cutting-edge technology. In 2017, we will explore ways to reduce the carbon intensity of our product with plans to also help our customers reduce and offset their consumption, and support our communities' efforts to replace more carbon intensive fuels with natural gas.\nSTRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. We remain focused on creating value in all our businesses. For our utility business, we are investing in the expansion of our Mist gas storage facility to provide innovative no-notice gas storage service for a single customer who will use the reliability of natural gas to integrate more intermittent renewable energy - like solar and wind - into the energy grid. We are pleased to be supporting the elimination of coal-fired electric generation renewables with this unique service. In addition, we remain focused on our non-utility businesses, including our gas storage business, and identifying higher value customers, enhanced service offerings, and seeking to capitalize on opportunities that fit our business-risk profile.\nDIVIDENDS\nDividend highlights include:\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.47 cents per share, payable on February 15, 2017, to shareholders of record on January 31, 2017, reflecting an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.88 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRegulatory Matters\nRegulation and Rates\nUTILITY. Our utility business is subject to regulation by the OPUC, WUTC, and FERC with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service. The OPUC and WUTC also regulate the system of accounts and issuance of securities by our utility. In 2016, approximately 89% of our utility gas customers were located in Oregon, with the remaining 11% in Washington. Earnings and cash flows from utility operations are largely determined by rates set in general rate cases and other proceedings in Oregon and Washington. They are also affected by the local economies in Oregon and Washington, the pace of customer growth in the residential, commercial, and industrial markets, and our ability to remain price competitive, control expenses, and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery of our utility-related costs, including operating expenses and investment costs in utility plant and other regulatory assets. See \"Most Recent General Rate Cases\" below.\nGAS STORAGE. Our gas storage business is subject to regulation by the OPUC, WUTC, CPUC, and FERC with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service. The OPUC and CPUC also regulate the issuance of securities, system of accounts, and regulate intrastate storage services. The FERC regulates interstate storage services. The FERC uses a maximum cost of service model which allows for gas storage prices to be set at or below the cost of service as approved by each agency in the last regulatory filing. The OPUC Schedule 80 rates are tied to the FERC rates, and are updated whenever we modify our FERC maximum rates. The CPUC regulates Gill Ranch under a market-based rate model which allows for the price of storage services to be set by the marketplace. In 2016, approximately 69% of our storage revenues were derived from FERC, Oregon, and Washington regulated operations and approximately 31% from California operations.\nMost Recent General Rate Cases\nOREGON. Effective November 1, 2012, the OPUC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 9.5%, an overall rate of return of 7.78%, and a capital structure of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt.\nWASHINGTON. Effective January 1, 2009, the WUTC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 10.1% and an overall rate of return of 8.4% with a capital structure\nof 51% common equity, 5% short-term debt, and 44% long-term debt.\nFERC. We are required under our Mist interstate storage certificate authority and rate approval orders to file every five years either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for our interstate storage services. In December 2013, we filed a rate petition, which was approved in 2014, and allows for the maximum cost-based rates for our interstate gas storage services. These rates were effective January 1, 2014, with the rate changes having no significant impact on our revenues.\nWe continuously monitor the utility and evaluate the need for a rate case. Currently, we are contemplating filing an Oregon rate case in late 2017 or in 2018 with a Washington rate case thereafter.\nRegulatory Proceeding Updates\nDuring 2016, we were involved in the regulatory activities discussed below.\nENVIRONMENTAL COST DEFERRAL AND SITE REMEDIATION AND RECOVERY MECHANISM (SRRM). In February 2015, as part of the implementation of the SRRM, the OPUC issued an Order (2015 Order) requiring us to forego collection of $15 million out of approximately $95 million in total environmental remediation expenses and associated carrying costs we had deferred through 2012 based on the OPUC's determination of how an earnings test should apply to amounts deferred from 2003 to 2012, with adjustments for other factors the OPUC deemed relevant. As a result, we recognized a $15.0 million non-cash charge in operations and maintenance expense in the first quarter of 2015. Also, as a result of the 2015 Order, we recognized $5.3 million pre-tax of interest income related to the equity earnings on our deferred environmental expenses in the first quarter of 2015.\nIn addition, the OPUC issued a subsequent Order regarding our SRRM (2016 order) in January 2016 in which the OPUC: (1) disallowed the recovery of $2.8 million of interest earned on the previously disallowed environmental expenditure amounts; (2) clarified the state allocation of 96.68% of environmental remediation costs for all environmental sites to Oregon; and (3) confirmed our treatment of $13.8 million of expenses put into the SRRM amortization account was correct and in compliance with prior OPUC orders. As a result of the 2016 Order, we recognized a $3.3 million non-cash charge, of which $2.8 million is reflected in other income and expense, net and $0.5 million is included in operations and maintenance expense. Our compliance filing related to the 2016 Order was filed with the OPUC on March 11, 2016. We do not expect any further action by the OPUC related to that filing. See Note 15 regarding our SRRM.\nSYSTEM INTEGRITY PROGRAM (SIP). We filed a request to extend the SIP program in the fourth quarter of 2014. The OPUC considered our renewal request at a public meeting in March 2015 and suspended our filing and ordered additional process, including involvement of other gas utilities in the state, before making a final decision. In 2016, we withdrew our request to extend the SIP program and\ninstead focused our efforts on establishing guidelines for future safety cost trackers with the OPUC. An all-party agreement was filed with the OPUC on October 10, 2016 and is currently under review. We expect resolution of this docket in the first half of 2017.\nHEDGING. In 2014 the OPUC opened a docket to discuss broader gas hedging practices across gas utilities in Oregon. This docket was divided into two phases. The first phase was focused on an analytical review of hedging and hedging practices. We are currently working through the second phase regarding potential hedging guidelines, and seeking an agreement through discussions with the parties. After the second phase is complete, a status report or other filing will be submitted to the OPUC, and the remainder of the process will be determined at that time. Currently, we anticipate resolution of the docket in the second half of 2017.\nThe WUTC is also conducting an investigation into the hedging practices of gas utilities operating in Washington, and considering whether it should require gas utilities to implement certain practices related to hedging. The WUTC received comments from all parties in the first half of 2016 and continues to review the comments and docket. After the WUTC completes their review, they will determine next steps in the docket.\nINTERSTATE STORAGE AND OPTIMIZATION SHARING. We received an Order from the OPUC in March 2015 on their review of the current revenue sharing arrangement that allocates a portion of the net revenues generated from non-utility Mist storage services and third-party asset management services to utility customers. The Order requires a third-party cost study to be performed and the results of the cost study may initiate a new docket or the re-opening of the original docket. In January 2017, all parties agreed and selected a third-party consultant to perform the study and are continuing to facilitate completion of the work directed by the OPUC.\nCARBON SOLUTIONS PROGRAM. Oregon Senate Bill 844 (SB 844) required the OPUC to develop rules and programs to reduce carbon emissions in Oregon. In June 2015, we submitted our first project related to Combined Heat and Power (CHP) for OPUC approval. The submitted CHP program would pay owners of new commercial- and industrial-scale CHP systems for verified carbon emission reductions. In April 2016, the OPUC issued an order declining our program as submitted and provided guidance on program structure for potential future submissions. We have worked with the stakeholders to reach common ground and are contemplating our next steps for this program.\nWEATHER NORMALIZATION MECHANISM (WARM). In Oregon, WARM is applied to residential and commercial customers' bills to adjust for temperature variances from average weather. In 2015, the OPUC initiated a review of the WARM mechanism as a result of customer complaints received related to surcharges applied under the WARM mechanism due to the record warm weather in our service territory during the 2014-15 winter. In May 2016, we filed a stipulation among the parties to resolve the issues identified in the review. In June 2016, the OPUC issued an order\nadopting the stipulation, which included modest changes to the WARM mechanism. The most notable change relates to the timing of collection of any unbilled WARM amounts, due to operation of certain caps on monthly bills in the program. Previously, any unbilled WARM amounts deferred through the WARM period were billed to customers in June. Under the adjusted WARM mechanism, the collections of any unbilled WARM amounts will continue to be deferred and will earn a carrying charge until collected in the PGA the following year. These changes do not reduce the value WARM provides to us or our customers in mitigating the impact from variations in weather.\nINTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN (IRP). We filed our 2016 Oregon and Washington IRPs on August 26, 2016. We received a letter of compliance from the WUTC, in December of 2016, in relation to our IRP in Washington and acknowledgment by the OPUC in February of 2017. The IRP included analysis of different growth scenarios and corresponding resource acquisition strategies. The analysis is needed to develop supply and demand resource requirements, consider uncertainties in the planning process, and to establish a plan for providing reliable and low cost natural gas service.\nGAS INCIDENT INVESTIGATION. On October 19, 2016, there was a natural gas explosion in Portland, Oregon after a third-party contractor damaged a NW Natural service line. The contractor was not working for NW Natural at the time. NW Natural and local authorities responded to the event and evacuated the necessary building prior to the ignition. No fatalities or life-threatening injuries were sustained. NW Natural is assisting the OPUC with an investigation regarding the incident.\nDEPRECIATION STUDY. Under OPUC regulations, the utility is required to file a depreciation study every five years to update or justify maintaining the existing depreciation rates. In December 2016, we filed the required depreciation study with the Commission and it is currently under review. We do not anticipate the study to materially change our current depreciation rates.\nHOLDING COMPANY APPLICATION. In February 2017, we filed applications with the OPUC, WUTC, and CPUC for approval to reorganize under a holding company structure. As one of only two local distribution companies remaining without a holding company structure, we recognize the advantages and flexibility inherent in such a structure and are exploring the possibility of such a reorganization. The filing of regulatory applications is the first of many steps required to form a holding company. We expect that the regulatory process will take six to nine months, and will result in the OPUC, WUTC and CPUC authorizing a holding company structure subject to certain restrictions, or \"ring-fencing\" provisions applicable to NW Natural, the entity that currently, and would continue to, house our utility operations. Once regulatory conditions and approvals are obtained, our Board of Directors will evaluate the desirability of a holding company structure in light of the conditions imposed. If supported by the Board of Directors, we would then submit the proposed corporate reorganization to our shareholders for approval. If approved by the shareholders, corporate filings would be made that would create the holding company, with the shareholders immediately prior to\nthe reorganization owning the same relative percentages of the holding company as they own of NW Natural immediately prior to the reorganization. The structure currently contemplated involves placing a non-operating corporate entity over our existing consolidated structure. If we were to determine that this reorganization were not desirable at any point in the process, the corporation reorganization would not proceed. We do not expect a material operational or financial impact to our business as a result of the contemplated reorganization.\nRate Mechanisms\nPURCHASED GAS ADJUSTMENT. Rate changes are established for the utility each year under PGA mechanisms in Oregon and Washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases. This includes gas costs under spot purchases as well as contract supplies, gas costs hedged with financial derivatives, gas costs from the withdrawal of storage inventories, the production of gas reserves, interstate pipeline demand costs, temporary rate adjustments, which amortize balances of deferred regulatory accounts, and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year.\nWe filed our PGA in September 2016 and received OPUC and WUTC approval in October 2016. PGA rate changes were effective November 1, 2016. The rate changes decreased the average monthly bills of residential customers by approximately 2.6% and 1.5% in Oregon and Washington, respectively. The decrease in Oregon reflects customers' portion of adjustments for changes in wholesale natural gas costs, offset by adjustments related to the decoupling mechanism, environmental costs, and additional annual adjustments based on ongoing orders with the OPUC. Washington rates reflected the effect of changes in wholesale natural gas costs, offset by slight increases in certain energy efficiency programs. In addition, we credited $19.4 million to customers in June 2016 for their portion of the gas cost sharing incentive for the 2015-2016 gas year, resulting from lower than projected gas costs, which were driven by warmer than normal weather, lower volume usage, and lower market prices.\nEach year, we typically hedge gas prices on approximately 75% of our utility's annual sales requirement based on normal weather, including both physical and financial hedges. We entered the 2016-17 gas year (November 1, 2016 - October 31, 2017) hedged at 75% of our forecasted sales volumes, including 48% in financial swap and option contracts and 27% in physical gas supplies. .\nIn addition to the amount hedged for the current gas contract year, we are also hedged in future years at approximately 26% for the 2017-18 gas year and between 4% and 18% for annual requirements over the subsequent five gas years as of December 31, 2016. Our hedge levels are subject to change based on actual load volumes, which depend to a certain extent on weather, economic conditions, and estimated gas reserve production. Also, our gas storage inventory levels may increase or decrease with storage expansion, changes in storage contracts with third parties, variations in the heat content of the gas, and/or storage recall by the utility.\nUnder the current PGA mechanism in Oregon, there is an incentive sharing provision whereby we are required to select each year an 80% deferral or a 90% deferral of higher or lower actual gas costs compared to estimated PGA prices, such that the impact on current earnings from the incentive sharing is either 20% or 10% of the difference between actual and estimated gas costs, respectively. For the 2015-16 and 2016-17 gas years, we selected the 80% and 90% deferral option, respectively. Under the Washington PGA mechanism, we defer 100% of the higher or lower actual gas costs, and those gas cost differences are passed on to customers through the annual PGA rate adjustment.\nEARNINGS TEST REVIEW. We are subject to an annual earnings review in Oregon to determine if the utility is earning above its authorized ROE threshold. If utility earnings exceed a specific ROE level, then 33% of the amount above that level is required to be deferred or refunded to customers. Under this provision, if we select the 80% deferral gas cost option, then we retain all of our earnings up to 150 basis points above the currently authorized ROE. If we select the 90% deferral option, then we", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is management's assessment of Northwest Natural Gas Company's (NW Natural or the Company) financial condition, including the principal factors that affect results of operations. The discussion refers to our consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. References in this discussion to \"Notes\" are to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nThe consolidated financial statements include NW Natural and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries including:\n \u2022 NW Natural Energy, LLC (NWN Energy); \n \u2022 NW Natural Gas Storage, LLC (NWN Gas Storage); \n \u2022 Gill Ranch Storage, LLC (Gill Ranch); \n \u2022 NNG Financial Corporation (NNG Financial); \n \u2022 Northwest Energy Corporation (Energy Corp); and \n \u2022 NWN Gas Reserves LLC (NWN Gas Reserves). \nWe operate in two primary reportable business segments: local gas distribution and gas storage. We also have other investments and business activities not specifically related to one of these two reporting segments, which we aggregate and report as other. We refer to our local gas distribution business as the utility, and our gas storage segment and other as non-utility. Our utility segment includes our NW Natural local gas distribution business, NWN Gas Reserves, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Corp, and the utility portion of our Mist underground storage facility in Oregon (Mist). Our gas storage segment includes NWN Gas Storage, which is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of NWN Energy, Gill Ranch, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NWN Gas Storage, the non-utility portion of Mist, and asset management services. Other includes NWN Energy's equity investment in Trail West Holding, LLC (TWH), which is pursuing the development of a proposed natural gas pipeline through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Trail West Pipeline, LLC (TWP), and NNG Financial's equity investment in Kelso-Beaver Pipeline (KB Pipeline). For a further discussion of our business segments and other, see Note 4.\nIn addition to presenting the results of operations and earnings amounts in total, certain financial measures are expressed in cents per share or exclude the after-tax regulatory disallowances related to the OPUC's 2015 and 2016 environmental orders, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We present net income and earnings per share (EPS) excluding the regulatory disallowances along with the U.S. GAAP measures to illustrate the magnitude of these disallowances on ongoing business and operational results. Although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income and earnings per share under U.S. GAAP, we believe the amount and nature of such disallowances make period to period comparisons of operations difficult or potentially confusing. Financial measures are expressed in cents per share as these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings, including income taxes. All references in this section to EPS are on the basis of diluted shares (see Note 3). We use such non-GAAP financial measures to analyze our financial performance because we believe they provide useful information to our investors and creditors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe manage our business and strategic initiatives with a long-term view of providing natural gas service safely and reliably to customers, working with regulators on key policy initiatives, and remaining focused on growing our business. See \"2017 Outlook\" below for more information. Highlights for the year include:\n \u2022 added over 10,700 customers during the past twelve months for a growth rate of 1.5% at December 31, 2016; \n \u2022 invested $140 million in our distribution system and facilities for growth and reliability, as well as for our North Mist gas storage expansion project; \n \u2022 received approval to begin construction of our $128 million North Mist gas storage expansion project with a target in-service date of the winter of 2018-19; \n \u2022 continued our legacy of excellent customer service with the highest residential customer satisfaction score among large utilities in the West and the second highest residential score in the nation in the 2016 J.D. Power Gas Utility Customer Satisfaction study; \n \u2022 ranked first in the West and posted the second highest score in the nation in the 2016 J.D. Powers' Gas Utility Business Customer Satisfaction Study; \n \u2022 reduced residential customer rates to the lowest level in 15 years with a rate reduction effective November 1, 2016, as well as a credit of $19.4 million to customers in June 2016; and \n \u2022 delivered increasing dividends for the 61st consecutive year. \nKey financial highlights include: Table 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In millions, except per share data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory environmental disallowance, net of taxes ($1.3, $5.9, and $0.0 for 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted consolidated net income(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utility margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>376.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>366.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas storage operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted ROE(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Regulatory environmental disallowance of $3.3 million in 2016 includes $2.8 million recorded in utility other income (expense), net and $0.5 million recorded in utility operations and maintenance expense. Regulatory environmental disallowance of $15.0 million in 2015 is recorded in utility operations and maintenance expense. Adjusted consolidated net income and EPS and adjusted ROE are non-GAAP financial measures based on the after-tax disallowance using the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 39.5%. EPS is calculated using 27.8 million, 27.4 million, and 27.2 million diluted shares for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\n2016 COMPARED TO 2015. Overall, consolidated net income increased $5.2 million. The increase was primarily due to the $9.1 million after-tax charge from 2015 and a $2.0 million after-tax charge in 2016 related to the regulatory disallowances associated with a February 2015 OPUC Order and subsequent Order in our SRRM docket. See additional disclosure in the table above.\nExcluding the impact of the non-cash charges from the SRRM docket in 2015 and 2016, adjusted consolidated net income decreased $1.9 million primarily due to the following factors:\n \u2022 a $7.0 million increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to cost savings initiatives that were implemented in the second half of 2015 that did not recur in 2016; and \n \u2022 a $5.5 million decrease in other income (expense), net primarily related to the recognition of $5.3 million of equity earnings on deferred regulatory asset balances as a result of the 2015 OPUC Order; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $5.2 million increase in utility margin primarily due to customer growth and gains from gas cost incentive sharing; and \n \u2022 a $3.9 million increase in gas storage revenues largely due to higher revenues from our asset management \nagreements at both storage facilities and slightly higher contract values at our Gill Ranch facility for the 2016-17 gas year.\n2015 COMPARED TO 2014. Overall, consolidated net income decreased $5.0 million primarily due to the $9.1 million after-tax charge related to the February 2015 OPUC Order previously discussed. Excluding the impact of this Order, adjusted consolidated net income increased $4.1 million primarily due to the following factors:\n \u2022 a $5.3 million increase in utility margin primarily due to customer growth and gas cost sharing, partially offset by the effects of warmer weather; and \n \u2022 a $5.8 million increase in other income (expense), net related to the recognition of equity earnings on deferred regulatory asset balances as a result of the OPUC SRRM Order; partially offset by \n \u2022 a $5.5 million increase in operations and maintenance expense mainly due to higher compensation and benefits expense; and \n \u2022 a $0.9 million decrease in gas storage operating revenues due to negative impacts of decreases in storage prices between the 2013-14 and 2014-15 gas years; and \n \u2022 a $1.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses due to additional utility capital expenditures. \n2017 OUTLOOK\nOur near-term outlook is centered on six long-term strategic objectives (1) delivering natural gas safely and reliably to our customers; (2) providing superior customer service; (3) working closely with policymakers and regulators to constructively meet the interests of all parties; (4) enabling continued utility growth; (5) leveraging the benefits of natural gas and our modern system to lead our region to a low-carbon future; and (6) strategically investing in our existing utility and gas storage businesses, as well as creating new ideas to drive future growth opportunities and to ensure long-term profitability.\nOur 2017 goals leverage our resources and history of innovation to continue meeting the evolving needs of customers, regulators, and shareholders.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deliver Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Grow Our Businesses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ensure Safe and Reliable Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Enable Utility Growth\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Provide a Superior Customer Experience\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lead in a Low-Carbon Future\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Advance Constructive Policies and Regulation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pursue Strategic Investments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSAFETY AND RELIABILITY. Delivering natural gas safely and reliably to customers is our first priority. During 2017, we will maintain our vigilant focus on safety and emergency response training for our employees, third-party contractors, and local authorities. We will continue to strive to increase public awareness of natural gas safety and protocols to reduce damages to our critical infrastructure. Continued investment in our pipeline system and facilities is also planned to ensure reliability with multi-year projects at our LNG facilities and Mist storage facility, as well as system upgrades in high-growth areas such as Clark County, Washington. Finally, safety also includes our continuous maintenance of strong cybersecurity defenses and preparation for large-scale emergency events, such as seismic hazards in our region.\nSUPERIOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. NW Natural has a legacy of providing excellent customer service with consistently high rankings in the J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction studies and a long-standing dedication to continuous improvement. In 2017, we will continue evolving to meet our customers' changing expectations by examining our customer interactions and touchpoints as well as the technology supporting these processes. We expect this comprehensive effort to propel further use of our innovative online customer connection portal and the latest technology, providing customers with an enhanced experience while improving operational efficiencies.\nPOLICIES AND REGULATION. Constructive policies and regulation provide the best outcomes for both customers and shareholders. In 2017, we plan to work closely with policymakers and regulators to plan for growth of our utility, and evaluate the investments necessary for this growth in our IRP. Finally, we will continue working with the EPA and other stakeholders on an environmentally protective and cost effective clean-up for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site.\nUTILITY GROWTH. Natural gas is a preferred energy choice in our service territory due to its efficiency and affordability coupled with our exceptional service. In 2017, we will continue leveraging these key attributes to capitalize on our region's above-average economic growth. We remain focused on maintaining our strong market share in the single-family residential sector, as well as capturing new commercial customers. As our Portland, Oregon community continues to experience in-migration and greater urban density, multifamily housing construction continues to outpace historical levels. Seeing this trend, we have launched a comprehensive effort to make inroads in the multifamily market with streamlined infrastructure designs, engineering technical support, and incentives and promotional support for qualifying projects. We will continue pursuing this sector in 2017.\nLOW-CARBON PATHWAY. The Pacific Northwest and NW Natural are deeply committed to a clean energy future. In 2017, we will continue pursuing opportunities for carbon emission savings for both our Company and the greater region. Driving greater emission reductions over time will require leveraging our modern pipeline systems in new ways, working closely with customers, policymakers and regulators, and embracing cutting-edge technology. In 2017, we will explore ways to reduce the carbon intensity of our product with plans to also help our customers reduce and offset their consumption, and support our communities' efforts to replace more carbon intensive fuels with natural gas.\nSTRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. We remain focused on creating value in all our businesses. For our utility business, we are investing in the expansion of our Mist gas storage facility to provide innovative no-notice gas storage service for a single customer who will use the reliability of natural gas to integrate more intermittent renewable energy - like solar and wind - into the energy grid. We are pleased to be supporting the elimination of coal-fired electric generation renewables with this unique service. In addition, we remain focused on our non-utility businesses, including our gas storage business, and identifying higher value customers, enhanced service offerings, and seeking to capitalize on opportunities that fit our business-risk profile.\nDIVIDENDS\nDividend highlights include:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.47 cents per share, payable on February 15, 2017, to shareholders of record on January 31, 2017, reflecting an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.88 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRegulatory Matters\nRegulation and Rates\nUTILITY. Our utility business is subject to regulation by the OPUC, WUTC, and FERC with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service. The OPUC and WUTC also regulate the system of accounts and issuance of securities by our utility. In 2016, approximately 89% of our utility gas customers were located in Oregon, with the remaining 11% in Washington. Earnings and cash flows from utility operations are largely determined by rates set in general rate cases and other proceedings in Oregon and Washington. They are also affected by the local economies in Oregon and Washington, the pace of customer growth in the residential, commercial, and industrial markets, and our ability to remain price competitive, control expenses, and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery of our utility-related costs, including operating expenses and investment costs in utility plant and other regulatory assets. See \"Most Recent General Rate Cases\" below.\nGAS STORAGE. Our gas storage business is subject to regulation by the OPUC, WUTC, CPUC, and FERC with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service. The OPUC and CPUC also regulate the issuance of securities, system of accounts, and regulate intrastate storage services. The FERC regulates interstate storage services. The FERC uses a maximum cost of service model which allows for gas storage prices to be set at or below the cost of service as approved by each agency in the last regulatory filing. The OPUC Schedule 80 rates are tied to the FERC rates, and are updated whenever we modify our FERC maximum rates. The CPUC regulates Gill Ranch under a market-based rate model which allows for the price of storage services to be set by the marketplace. In 2016, approximately 69% of our storage revenues were derived from FERC, Oregon, and Washington regulated operations and approximately 31% from California operations.\nMost Recent General Rate Cases\nOREGON. Effective November 1, 2012, the OPUC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 9.5%, an overall rate of return of 7.78%, and a capital structure of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt.\nWASHINGTON. Effective January 1, 2009, the WUTC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 10.1% and an overall rate of return of 8.4% with a capital structure\nof 51% common equity, 5% short-term debt, and 44% long-term debt.\nFERC. We are required under our Mist interstate storage certificate authority and rate approval orders to file every five years either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for our interstate storage services. In December 2013, we filed a rate petition, which was approved in 2014, and allows for the maximum cost-based rates for our interstate gas storage services. These rates were effective January 1, 2014, with the rate changes having no significant impact on our revenues.\nWe continuously monitor the utility and evaluate the need for a rate case. Currently, we are contemplating filing an Oregon rate case in late 2017 or in 2018 with a Washington rate case thereafter.\nRegulatory Proceeding Updates\nDuring 2016, we were involved in the regulatory activities discussed below.\nENVIRONMENTAL COST DEFERRAL AND SITE REMEDIATION AND RECOVERY MECHANISM (SRRM). In February 2015, as part of the implementation of the SRRM, the OPUC issued an Order (2015 Order) requiring us to forego collection of $15 million out of approximately $95 million in total environmental remediation expenses and associated carrying costs we had deferred through 2012 based on the OPUC's determination of how an earnings test should apply to amounts deferred from 2003 to 2012, with adjustments for other factors the OPUC deemed relevant. As a result, we recognized a $15.0 million non-cash charge in operations and maintenance expense in the first quarter of 2015. Also, as a result of the 2015 Order, we recognized $5.3 million pre-tax of interest income related to the equity earnings on our deferred environmental expenses in the first quarter of 2015.\nIn addition, the OPUC issued a subsequent Order regarding our SRRM (2016 order) in January 2016 in which the OPUC: (1) disallowed the recovery of $2.8 million of interest earned on the previously disallowed environmental expenditure amounts; (2) clarified the state allocation of 96.68% of environmental remediation costs for all environmental sites to Oregon; and (3) confirmed our treatment of $13.8 million of expenses put into the SRRM amortization account was correct and in compliance with prior OPUC orders. As a result of the 2016 Order, we recognized a $3.3 million non-cash charge, of which $2.8 million is reflected in other income and expense, net and $0.5 million is included in operations and maintenance expense. Our compliance filing related to the 2016 Order was filed with the OPUC on March 11, 2016. We do not expect any further action by the OPUC related to that filing. See Note 15 regarding our SRRM.\nSYSTEM INTEGRITY PROGRAM (SIP). We filed a request to extend the SIP program in the fourth quarter of 2014. The OPUC considered our renewal request at a public meeting in March 2015 and suspended our filing and ordered additional process, including involvement of other gas utilities in the state, before making a final decision. In 2016, we withdrew our request to extend the SIP program and\ninstead focused our efforts on establishing guidelines for future safety cost trackers with the OPUC. An all-party agreement was filed with the OPUC on October 10, 2016 and is currently under review. We expect resolution of this docket in the first half of 2017.\nHEDGING. In 2014 the OPUC opened a docket to discuss broader gas hedging practices across gas utilities in Oregon. This docket was divided into two phases. The first phase was focused on an analytical review of hedging and hedging practices. We are currently working through the second phase regarding potential hedging guidelines, and seeking an agreement through discussions with the parties. After the second phase is complete, a status report or other filing will be submitted to the OPUC, and the remainder of the process will be determined at that time. Currently, we anticipate resolution of the docket in the second half of 2017.\nThe WUTC is also conducting an investigation into the hedging practices of gas utilities operating in Washington, and considering whether it should require gas utilities to implement certain practices related to hedging. The WUTC received comments from all parties in the first half of 2016 and continues to review the comments and docket. After the WUTC completes their review, they will determine next steps in the docket.\nINTERSTATE STORAGE AND OPTIMIZATION SHARING. We received an Order from the OPUC in March 2015 on their review of the current revenue sharing arrangement that allocates a portion of the net revenues generated from non-utility Mist storage services and third-party asset management services to utility customers. The Order requires a third-party cost study to be performed and the results of the cost study may initiate a new docket or the re-opening of the original docket. In January 2017, all parties agreed and selected a third-party consultant to perform the study and are continuing to facilitate completion of the work directed by the OPUC.\nCARBON SOLUTIONS PROGRAM. Oregon Senate Bill 844 (SB 844) required the OPUC to develop rules and programs to reduce carbon emissions in Oregon. In June 2015, we submitted our first project related to Combined Heat and Power (CHP) for OPUC approval. The submitted CHP program would pay owners of new commercial- and industrial-scale CHP systems for verified carbon emission reductions. In April 2016, the OPUC issued an order declining our program as submitted and provided guidance on program structure for potential future submissions. We have worked with the stakeholders to reach common ground and are contemplating our next steps for this program.\nWEATHER NORMALIZATION MECHANISM (WARM). In Oregon, WARM is applied to residential and commercial customers' bills to adjust for temperature variances from average weather. In 2015, the OPUC initiated a review of the WARM mechanism as a result of customer complaints received related to surcharges applied under the WARM mechanism due to the record warm weather in our service territory during the 2014-15 winter. In May 2016, we filed a stipulation among the parties to resolve the issues identified in the review. In June 2016, the OPUC issued an order\nadopting the stipulation, which included modest changes to the WARM mechanism. The most notable change relates to the timing of collection of any unbilled WARM amounts, due to operation of certain caps on monthly bills in the program. Previously, any unbilled WARM amounts deferred through the WARM period were billed to customers in June. Under the adjusted WARM mechanism, the collections of any unbilled WARM amounts will continue to be deferred and will earn a carrying charge until collected in the PGA the following year. These changes do not reduce the value WARM provides to us or our customers in mitigating the impact from variations in weather.\nINTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN (IRP). We filed our 2016 Oregon and Washington IRPs on August 26, 2016. We received a letter of compliance from the WUTC, in December of 2016, in relation to our IRP in Washington and acknowledgment by the OPUC in February of 2017. The IRP included analysis of different growth scenarios and corresponding resource acquisition strategies. The analysis is needed to develop supply and demand resource requirements, consider uncertainties in the planning process, and to establish a plan for providing reliable and low cost natural gas service.\nGAS INCIDENT INVESTIGATION. On October 19, 2016, there was a natural gas explosion in Portland, Oregon after a third-party contractor damaged a NW Natural service line. The contractor was not working for NW Natural at the time. NW Natural and local authorities responded to the event and evacuated the necessary building prior to the ignition. No fatalities or life-threatening injuries were sustained. NW Natural is assisting the OPUC with an investigation regarding the incident.\nDEPRECIATION STUDY. Under OPUC regulations, the utility is required to file a depreciation study every five years to update or justify maintaining the existing depreciation rates. In December 2016, we filed the required depreciation study with the Commission and it is currently under review. We do not anticipate the study to materially change our current depreciation rates.\nHOLDING COMPANY APPLICATION. In February 2017, we filed applications with the OPUC, WUTC, and CPUC for approval to reorganize under a holding company structure. As one of only two local distribution companies remaining without a holding company structure, we recognize the advantages and flexibility inherent in such a structure and are exploring the possibility of such a reorganization. The filing of regulatory applications is the first of many steps required to form a holding company. We expect that the regulatory process will take six to nine months, and will result in the OPUC, WUTC and CPUC authorizing a holding company structure subject to certain restrictions, or \"ring-fencing\" provisions applicable to NW Natural, the entity that currently, and would continue to, house our utility operations. Once regulatory conditions and approvals are obtained, our Board of Directors will evaluate the desirability of a holding company structure in light of the conditions imposed. If supported by the Board of Directors, we would then submit the proposed corporate reorganization to our shareholders for approval. If approved by the shareholders, corporate filings would be made that would create the holding company, with the shareholders immediately prior to\nthe reorganization owning the same relative percentages of the holding company as they own of NW Natural immediately prior to the reorganization. The structure currently contemplated involves placing a non-operating corporate entity over our existing consolidated structure. If we were to determine that this reorganization were not desirable at any point in the process, the corporation reorganization would not proceed. We do not expect a material operational or financial impact to our business as a result of the contemplated reorganization.\nRate Mechanisms\nPURCHASED GAS ADJUSTMENT. Rate changes are established for the utility each year under PGA mechanisms in Oregon and Washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases. This includes gas costs under spot purchases as well as contract supplies, gas costs hedged with financial derivatives, gas costs from the withdrawal of storage inventories, the production of gas reserves, interstate pipeline demand costs, temporary rate adjustments, which amortize balances of deferred regulatory accounts, and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year.\nWe filed our PGA in September 2016 and received OPUC and WUTC approval in October 2016. PGA rate changes were effective November 1, 2016. The rate changes decreased the average monthly bills of residential customers by approximately 2.6% and 1.5% in Oregon and Washington, respectively. The decrease in Oregon reflects customers' portion of adjustments for changes in wholesale natural gas costs, offset by adjustments related to the decoupling mechanism, environmental costs, and additional annual adjustments based on ongoing orders with the OPUC. Washington rates reflected the effect of changes in wholesale natural gas costs, offset by slight increases in certain energy efficiency programs. In addition, we credited $19.4 million to customers in June 2016 for their portion of the gas cost sharing incentive for the 2015-2016 gas year, resulting from lower than projected gas costs, which were driven by warmer than normal weather, lower volume usage, and lower market prices.\nEach year, we typically hedge gas prices on approximately 75% of our utility's annual sales requirement based on normal weather, including both physical and financial hedges. We entered the 2016-17 gas year (November 1, 2016 - October 31, 2017) hedged at 75% of our forecasted sales volumes, including 48% in financial swap and option contracts and 27% in physical gas supplies. .\nIn addition to the amount hedged for the current gas contract year, we are also hedged in future years at approximately 26% for the 2017-18 gas year and between 4% and 18% for annual requirements over the subsequent five gas years as of December 31, 2016. Our hedge levels are subject to change based on actual load volumes, which depend to a certain extent on weather, economic conditions, and estimated gas reserve production. Also, our gas storage inventory levels may increase or decrease with storage expansion, changes in storage contracts with third parties, variations in the heat content of the gas, and/or storage recall by the utility.\nUnder the current PGA mechanism in Oregon, there is an incentive sharing provision whereby we are required to select each year an 80% deferral or a 90% deferral of higher or lower actual gas costs compared to estimated PGA prices, such that the impact on current earnings from the incentive sharing is either 20% or 10% of the difference between actual and estimated gas costs, respectively. For the 2015-16 and 2016-17 gas years, we selected the 80% and 90% deferral option, respectively. Under the Washington PGA mechanism, we defer 100% of the higher or lower actual gas costs, and those gas cost differences are passed on to customers through the annual PGA rate adjustment.\nEARNINGS TEST REVIEW. We are subject to an annual earnings review in Oregon to determine if the utility is earning above its authorized ROE threshold. If utility earnings exceed a specific ROE level, then 33% of the amount above that level is required to be deferred or refunded to customers. Under this provision, if we select the 80% deferral gas cost option, then we retain all of our earnings up to 150 basis points above the currently authorized ROE. If we select the 90% deferral option, then we"}
