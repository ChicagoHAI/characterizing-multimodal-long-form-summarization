Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the natural immune system response against microbial pathogens and is a critical regulator of inflammation. Our ability to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action has enabled us to create a platform with the potential to generate differentiated product candidates.\nThe two key components of our nitric oxide platform are our proprietary Nitricil technology, which drives the creation of new chemical entities, or NCEs, and our formulation science, both of which we use to tune our product candidates for specific indications. Our ability to deploy nitric oxide in a solid form, on demand and in localized formulations allows us the potential to improve patient outcomes in a variety of diseases.\nWe have advanced strategic development programs in the field of dermatology, while also further expanding the platform into women's health and gastroenterological, or GI, therapeutic areas. We have clinical-stage dermatology drug candidates with multi-factorial (SB204), anti-viral (SB206), anti-fungal (SB208) and anti-inflammatory (SB414) mechanisms of action. We have recently introduced SB207 as a possible product candidate for additional anti-viral programs. During 2019, our clinical-stage development efforts were focused on our molluscum contagiosum (SB206) and atopic dermatitis (SB414) programs. We also conducted preclinical work on NCEs and formulations for the treatment of human papilloma virus, or HPV, related illnesses in the women's health field (WH504 and WH602) and inflammatory diseases in the GI field. During 2020, we intend to focus our clinical-stage development efforts on our molluscum contagiosum (SB206) program, subject to available capital and regulatory feedback. All other clinical-stage programs are currently on hold. Further advancement of the molluscum contagiosum (SB206) program, or any other program across our platform, is dependent upon our ability to access additional capital. Additional capital may potentially include (i) non-dilutive sources, such as partnerships, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships; or (ii) equity or debt financings. Any issuance of equity or debt that could be convertible into equity would result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. We intend to pursue financing which may be dilutive, non-dilutive or both, in the near future. We intend to utilize one or more financial advisors to assist in the pursuit of optimal capital sourcing pathways, including those that are strategic in nature and center around our late-stage assets, and the broader dermatology platform and underlying Nitricil technology, as well as exploring other potential sources of financing and strategic alternatives.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a total cash and cash equivalents balance of $13.7 million and positive working capital of $2.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our planned operating needs into the early part of the second quarter of 2020. This projected cash runway excludes (i) potential costs associated with an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial, which is subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020, and (ii) any proceeds received subsequent to January 31, 2020 from potential future sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, described below, if available.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs, as described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. Therefore, we will need to secure additional capital or financing and/or delay, defer, or reduce our cash expenditures by the early part of the second quarter of 2020, including those associated with our product development programs, or we may need to dissolve and liquidate our assets or seek protection under bankruptcy laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or financing on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all. If we are forced to terminate or eliminate our product development programs,\nwind down our operations, liquidate or seek bankruptcy protection, it is unclear to what extent we will be able to pay our obligations, and, accordingly, it is further unclear whether and to what extent any resources would be available for distributions to our stockholders. Alternatively, we may seek to engage in one or more potential transactions, such as the sale of the Company, or sale or divestiture of some of our assets, such as a sale of our dermatology platform assets, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such a transaction or transactions on a timely basis or at all or on terms that are favorable to us.\nAs described below in Business Updates,\u201d in August 2019 we entered into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor, Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase shares of our common stock at our request from time to time during the 30-month term of the agreement.\nAs also described below in Business Updates,\u201d in late April 2019 and early May 2019 we entered into (i) a royalty and milestone payments purchase agreement with a stockholder that provided $25.0 million of immediate funding; and (ii) a development funding and royalties agreement with a corporate partner that provided $12.0 million of immediate funding.\nWe will need additional funding to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs. Please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion of our current liquidity and our future funding needs.\nDuring 2019, our primary programmatic focus was on our molluscum contagiosum (SB206) and atopic dermatitis (SB414) programs.\nWe conducted and completed our SB206 Phase 2 trial for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in December 2018 and in early March 2019, completed an end-of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and received written minutes. During the second quarter of 2019, we commenced the Phase 3 pivotal development program for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Patient recruitment for the Phase 3 trials was completed in August 2019. Top-line efficacy results from the Phase 3 trials were announced in January 2020. SB206 did not achieve statistically significant results in the primary endpoint in both trials, which was the complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. Based on the results of the Phase 3 pivotal trials described below in Key Clinical Stage Product Candidate Development Updates,\u201d we target commencing an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2020, subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020. Execution of remaining Phase 3 pivotal development program activities continues into 2020 with receipt of pivotal trial safety data in the first quarter of 2020 and completion of ancillary trials targeted prior to or during the second quarter of 2020.\nFollowing the completion of two complementary Phase 1b clinical trials with SB414 in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis in 2018, we conducted non-clinical studies with SB414 for atopic dermatitis and completed our Phase 2 clinical development plan during 2019 to support a potential future Phase 2 clinical program launch. The SB414 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nKey Clinical Stage Product Candidate Development Updates\nSB206, a Topical Anti-viral Treatment for Viral Skin Infections\nWe are developing SB206 as a topical anti-viral gel for the treatment of viral skin infections, with a current focus on molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum is a contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus. Molluscum affects up to six million people in the U.S. annually. The greatest incidence is in children aged one to 14 years. The average time to resolution is 13 months, however, 13% of children experience lesions that may not resolve in 24 months. There is no FDA-approved treatment for molluscum. More than half of patients diagnosed with the infection are untreated. The majority of patients that receive treatment are treated with painful procedures and the remaining are often prescribed products indicated for the treatment of external genital warts.\nWe believed that observational learnings from an in-licensed topical nitric oxide technology study showing clinically meaningful complete clearance rates of baseline molluscum lesions, combined with our SB206 program knowledge, provided a logical pathway for SB206 development in the molluscum indication. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA in December 2017 and initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial utilizing SB206 for the treatment of molluscum in the first quarter of 2018. The Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, ascending dose clinical trial evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SB206 in 256 patients, ages 2 and above, with molluscum. Patients were treated with one of three concentrations of SB206 or vehicle for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. We announced top-line results from this Phase 2\nclinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. SB206 demonstrated statistically significant results in the clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12, with signs of efficacy evident as early as Week 2 with the 12% once-daily dose. The safety and tolerability profiles were favorable overall with no serious adverse events reported, including the most effective dose, SB206 12% once-daily.\nWith the full results from this Phase 2 trial made available, we held an end-of-Phase 2 (Type B) meeting with the FDA in early March 2019. Based on this meeting and the written minutes received, we commenced the Phase 3 development program for molluscum, primarily comprised of two pivotal clinical trials, in the second quarter of 2019 with SB206 12% once-daily as the active treatment arm. The B-SIMPLE\u201d (Berdazimer Sodium In Molluscum Patients with Lesions) Phase 3 pivotal trials consisted of two (B-SIMPLE1 and B-SIMPLE2) multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SB206 12% once-daily in approximately 680 patients (2:1 active:vehicle randomization), ages 6 months and above, with molluscum. Patients were treated once-daily with SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel once daily for a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks to all treatable lesions (baseline and new). There were visits at Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and a safety follow-up at Week 24. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. Both Phase 3 pivotal trials began dosing patients in June 2019 and we completed patient recruitment in August 2019. Top-line efficacy results from the Phase 3 trials were announced in January 2020.\nSB206 did not achieve statistically significant results in the primary endpoint in both trials, which was the complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. In B-SIMPLE2, SB206 was near statistical significance for the primary endpoint (p=0.062), and was statistically significant for the secondary endpoint, the complete clearance of all lesions at Week 8 (p=0.028), and all other pre-specified sensitivity analyses. We believe this confirms the robustness of the data in the B-SIMPLE2 trial. While the B-SIMPLE1 trial was not statistically significant for the primary endpoint (p=0.375) nor the secondary endpoint (p=0.202), all other pre-specified analyses trended in the same direction of improved treatment effect as the B-SIMPLE2 results.\nIn addition, the results of a statistical test of heterogeneity support that the two pivotal trials are not different from each other. Across both studies, the primary analysis odds ratio and standard error point estimates were similar and in a consistent direction with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These statistical results are supported by an integrated analysis of the two pivotal trials, which demonstrated statistically significant complete clearance rates at Week 12 for SB206 (p=0.049). These additional analyses do not change the outcome of either B-SIMPLE trial, and the FDA may disagree with our conclusions from these analyses. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of less than 0.050 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance.\nThe last subject completed their final visit as part of the ongoing safety evaluation through Week 24 in February 2020 and full efficacy and safety data, including data from the safety evaluation through Week 24, are targeted to be available in March 2020.\nBased on the results of the Phase 3 pivotal trials, discussed above, we target commencing an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2020, subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020.\nExecution of remaining Phase 3 pivotal development program activities for SB206 in molluscum continues into 2020 with receipt of pivotal trial safety data in the first quarter of 2020 and the completion of ancillary trials targeted prior to or during the second quarter of 2020.\nSB414, a Topical Cream for the Treatment of Inflammatory Skin Diseases\nIn 2018, we completed two complementary Phase 1b clinical trials with SB414 in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The design of these complementary trials was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SB414. The trials were also designed to assess overall and specific target engagement through a reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers, also known as pharmacodynamic assessment.\nAtopic Dermatitis\nWe initiated a Phase 1b trial with SB414 in adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in December 2017. In the Phase 1b trial, 48 adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis with up to 30% body surface area at baseline, were randomized to receive one of 2% SB414 cream, 6% SB414 cream, or vehicle, twice daily for two weeks. In the complementary Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks.\nWe received and analyzed the preliminary top line results from the Phase 1b clinical trials during the second and third quarters of 2018. In the atopic dermatitis trial, biomarkers from the Th2, Th17 and Th22 inflammatory pathways known to be highly relevant and indicative of atopic dermatitis, including Interleukin-13, or IL-13, IL-4R, IL-5, IL-17A and IL-22, were downregulated after two weeks of treatment with SB414 2%. The changes in Th2 and Th22 biomarkers and clinical efficacy assessed as the percent change in Eczema Area Severity Index scores were highly correlated in the SB414 2% group. Additionally, the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 3-point improvement on the pruritus (itch) numeric rating scale after two weeks of treatment was greater for patients treated with SB414 2% compared to patients treated with vehicle.\nThe 2% or 6% doses of SB414 in the trial did not result in any serious adverse events, and SB414 2% was more tolerable with no patients discontinuing treatment in the trial due to application site reactions. SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. Additionally, SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours, in both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. Given the successful downregulation of key biomarkers, favorable tolerability and lack of systemic exposure with SB414 2%, we conducted non-clinical studies and completed our Phase 2 clinical development plan during 2019 to support a potential future Phase 2 clinical program launch. The SB414 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nPsoriasis\nWe initiated clinical development of SB414, our first use of our nitric oxide platform in the field of immunology by dosing the first patient in October 2017 in a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate SB414 in a cream for the treatment of psoriasis. Earlier in 2017, we presented mechanistic evidence for SB414, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in composite psoriasis scores and an inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F in an animal model.\nIn the Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks. We received and analyzed the preliminary top line results from this Phase 1b clinical trial during the second and third quarters of 2018. SB414 at the 6% dose did not result in any serious adverse events, but SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across the trial. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. Additionally, SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours. Based on the results of the Phase 1b trial in psoriasis, we will potentially explore the use of lower doses of SB414 in psoriasis, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nSB204, for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we conducted a Type C meeting to further discuss the path forward for our SB204 candidate and possible Phase 3 programs for the treatment of acne vulgaris with the FDA, and the potential for proceeding with a more narrowly defined patient segmentation. In that meeting, our focus was centered specifically on the severe patient population. In the third quarter of 2018, the FDA provided feedback in their minutes on two paths forward for the acne indication, confirming the need for one additional pivotal trial for moderate-to-severe acne patients prior to a NDA submission or, as an alternative, additional preliminary trials for a severe-only patient population.\nFollowing receipt of FDA feedback via written minutes, we have determined that the most pragmatic development pathway for us will be to conduct one additional pivotal Phase 3 trial in moderate-to-severe acne patients. We have completed our clinical development plan for this additional trial, and further advancement of this program is subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nKey Preclinical Stage Product Candidate Development Updates\nExpansion of Nitric Oxide Platform\nIn December 2019, we received written responses in response to a pre-IND meeting request with the FDA for a new anti-viral product candidate, SB207. We have identified targeted viral opportunities of high unmet need where we believe our nitric oxide releasing technology could provide clinical benefit to patients. The SB207 product incorporates our existing drug substance, berdazimer sodium (NVN1000), with a new formulation specifically engineered for a number of anti-viral programs.\nAdvancement in Women's Health\nIn August 2019, we received a Phase 1 Federal grant of approximately $0.2 million from the National Institutes of Health. The funds are to be used to advance formulation development of a nitric oxide-containing intravaginal gel (WH602) designed to treat high-risk HPV infections that can lead to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or CIN. The specific focus is to ensure the nitric oxide delivery from the gel replicates doses of nitric oxide previously demonstrated to be effective against HPV in our clinical and in vitro studies.\nIn February 2020, following the successful progression of Phase 1, we were awarded a Phase 2 federal grant of approximately $1.0 million from the NIH that will enable the conduct of IND-enabling toxicology and pharmacology studies and other preclinical activity with respect to WH602. We may be eligible to receive an additional $0.5 million in funding as part of this Phase 2 grant, subject to availability of NIH funds and satisfactory progress of the project during the initial 12-month term.\nIn September 2019, we received a Federal grant from the U.S. Department of Defense's, or DoD, Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, or CDMRP, of approximately $1.1 million as part of its Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program. The grant will support the development of a non-gel formulation product candidate (WH504) designed to treat high-risk HPV infections that can lead to CIN, with well-characterized physical chemical properties suitable for intravaginal administration. In addition, the grant will support the evaluation of the effect of varying concentrations and treatment durations of berdazimer sodium (NVN1000) against HPV-18 in human raft cell culture in vitro studies. This targeted research aims to create a disease-altering treatment that could be used upon detection and the early signs of high-risk HPV infection to intervene before progression to cervical cancer.\nUnder the terms of the aforementioned NIH and DoD grants, we are entitled to receive the grant funds in the form of periodic reimbursements of our allowable direct expenses, allocated overhead, general and administrative expenses and payment of other specified amounts.\nThese product candidates currently in development together represent the core of our Women's Health business unit. This unit has continued to be supported through a collaboration with Health Decisions, Inc., or Health Decisions.\nAddition of Gastrointestinal Disease as a Therapeutic Focus\nIn January 2019, we announced the addition of GI diseases as a therapeutic focus area as part of our overall science and business strategy. This decision is based on the connection between the multi-factorial pathologies of GI diseases and the demonstrable anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of Novan's nitric oxide technology. Nitric oxide produced in the GI tract regulates many of its functions including the secretion of mucous for protection against physical, chemical, and microbial injury, perfusion of blood through the GI tissue, mitigation of white blood cell adherence to GI tissue to protect from injury and the healing and repair of ulcers. We believe that our initial expansion into GI will require minimal investment due to our ability to leverage current technology, experience and assets.\nBusiness Updates\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement with Aspire Capital\nOn August 30, 2019, we entered into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock at our request from time to time during the 30-month term of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. The aggregate amount that we may raise through sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement is subject to certain limitations including, but not limited to: (i) the number of shares that may be sold will be limited to 5,211,339 shares, representing 19.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock on August 30, 2019, if the average price paid for all shares issued under the agreement is less than $2.17; and (ii) on any purchase date, the closing sale price of our common stock must be greater than or equal to $0.25. As of December 31, 2019, we had sold an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $2.49 per share under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. As of January 31, 2020, we had sold an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $1.19 per share under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. These amounts, combined with the 345,622 shares issued as part of the commitment fee related to the agreement's execution, leads to a total of 1,345,622 shares issued to Aspire Capital under the agreement as of January 31, 2020.\nConcurrently with entering into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with Aspire Capital, or the Registration Rights Agreement, in which we agreed to file one or more registration statements, as permissible and necessary to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, registering the sale of the shares of our common stock that have been and may be issued to Aspire Capital under the Aspire\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreement. On September 16, 2019, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, a prospectus to our effective Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-233632) registering 7,032,630 shares of common stock that have been and may be offered to Aspire Capital from time to time under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement.\nThere are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, and we will control the timing and amount of sales of our common stock to Aspire Capital. Aspire Capital has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as we may direct in accordance with the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future financing transactions, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. In consideration for entering into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we issued to Aspire Capital 345,622 shares of our common stock as part of the commitment fee. The Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us any time, at our discretion, without any penalty or additional cost to us. Any proceeds we receive under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nPlease refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.\nRoyalty and Milestone Payments Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek Investments LLC\nOn April 29, 2019, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek, pursuant to which Reedy Creek provided us funding in an initial amount of $25.0 million, which we will use primarily to pursue the development, regulatory approval and commercialization (including through out-license agreements and other third-party arrangements) activities for SB206, for the treatment of molluscum, and advancing programmatically other activities with respect to SB414, for atopic dermatitis, and SB204, for acne. Reedy Creek was to provide $10.0 million of additional funding contingent upon our achievement of SB206 clinical trial success, defined as (i) the achievement, no later than March 31, 2020, of statistically significant rates of complete clearance of lesions for molluscum contagiosum in humans at week 12 in each of the two Phase 3 clinical trials or any other primary endpoint required or accepted by the FDA for the SB206 product; or (ii) equivalent achievement (as agreed upon by the parties). Based on the top line efficacy results from the Phase 3 SB206 program released in January 2020, we understand that Reedy Creek will not be paying us the contingent $10.0 million of additional funding.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will pay Reedy Creek ongoing quarterly payments, calculated based on an applicable percentage per product of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments received by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for SB204, SB206 and SB414 in the United States, Mexico or Canada, net of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments paid by us to third parties pursuant to any agreements under which we have in-licensed intellectual property with respect to such products.\nThe applicable percentage used for determining the ongoing quarterly payments, applied to amounts received directly by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for each product, ranges from 10% for SB206 to 20% for SB414 and SB204. However, the agreement provides that the applicable percentage for each product will be 25% for fees or milestone payments received by us (but not royalty payments received by us) until Reedy Creek has received payments under the Purchase Agreement equal to the total funding amount provided by Reedy Creek under the Purchase Agreement. If we decide to commercialize SB204, SB206 or SB414 on our own following regulatory approval, as opposed to commercializing through an out-license agreement or other third-party arrangement, we will be obligated to pay Reedy Creek a low single digits royalty on net sales of such products.\nDevelopment Funding and Royalties Agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\nOn May 4, 2019, we entered into the Funding Agreement, with Ligand, pursuant to which Ligand provided us funding of $12.0 million, which we used to pursue the development and regulatory approval of SB206, for the treatment of molluscum.\nPursuant to the Funding Agreement, we will pay Ligand up to $20.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement by us of certain regulatory and commercial milestones associated with SB206 or any product that incorporates or uses NVN1000, the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our clinical stage product candidates, for the treatment of molluscum. In addition to the milestone payments, we will pay Ligand tiered royalties ranging from 7% to 10% based on annual aggregate net sales of such products in the United States, Mexico or Canada.\nDrug Substance and Drug Product Agreements\nOn October 15, 2018, we established a strategic alliance with Orion, a Finnish full-scale pharmaceutical company with broad experience in drug manufacturing. The alliance enables Orion to manufacture our topical nitric oxide-releasing product candidates on our behalf and on the behalf of our global strategic partners. We have executed a master contract manufacturing agreement to enable technology transfer and manufacturing of clinical trial materials for future clinical trials with our topical product candidates. We are engaged in the transfer of technology for the manufacture of both SB204 and SB206, and upon its completion intend for Orion to be able to manufacture the drug product, or the finished dosage form of the gel, in accordance with our established manufacturing processes, in compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines, as appropriate for clinical trials and alongside our current internal manufacturing capabilities. A completed manufacturing technology transfer to Orion will enable the manufacture of multiple assets for clinical trial materials and, potentially, commercial quantities. Importantly, this alliance is being structured to support major global markets in which we and our partners pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates and complements our present internal capability.\nIn June 2019, we executed a master contract manufacturing agreement with a full-scale active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturer. The agreement established an operating and business relationship for this manufacturer to become the primary external supplier of our proprietary berdazimer sodium (NVN1000) drug substance. Also incorporated in the agreement is the process and analytical method transfer necessary to advance the production of our berdazimer sodium (NVN1000) drug substance for future clinical trials and importantly, upon approval of any of our drug product candidates, for commercial purposes on a global basis. We are engaged in the transfer of the NVN1000 manufacturing technology and upon its completion intend for this API manufacturer to be able to manufacture NVN1000 in accordance with our established manufacturing processes, in compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines, as appropriate for clinical trials and alongside our current internal manufacturing capabilities.\nThe progression of the relationships with the aforementioned third-party manufacturers is integral to the advancement of our dermatological platform, including our SB206 molluscum program, by us or through partnerships, collaborations, licensing or other strategic relationships. This strategy includes an increased utilization of and reliance upon third-party vendors and strategic partners for the performance of activities, processes and services that (i) do not result in the generation of significant new intellectual property; and (ii) can leverage existing robust infrastructure, systems, and facilities as well as associated subject matter expertise. A parallel and inter-related strategic objective is to reduce our own internal resources, facilities, and infrastructure capabilities that have historically performed such activities, processes and services. As part of our strategic objective to reduce our own internal resources, facilities, and infrastructure capabilities, we took actions in February 2020 that are intended to reduce our internal resources from a total of 42 employees as of December 31, 2019 to a total of 28 employees as of April 1, 2020.\nWe believe this broad strategy can ultimately provide enhanced capabilities and operating efficiencies for us or any potential partnerships, collaborations, licensing or other strategic relationships we may enter. Although the third-party manufacturers are reducing their near-term activities and extending their time lines at our request in an effort to reduce our near-term cash utilization and extend our operating cash runway, we expect to incur certain incremental and discrete costs to effect this strategy upon resumption of the manufacturers' transfer activities. Similarly, we expect to incur certain incremental and discrete costs as we seek to reduce our own internal resources, facilities, and infrastructure capabilities, including those actions we took in February 2020 to reduce our internal resources. We will need substantial additional funding to continue our operating activities, including these technical transfer projects and internal cost structure changes, and to make further advancements in our drug development programs, as described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nCorporate Updates\nChief Executive Officer Transition\nIn December 2019, we announced that Paula Brown Stafford, our President and Chief Operating Officer, would succeed G. Kelly Martin as our Chief Executive Officer, effective February 2, 2020. Mr. Martin had a fixed term employment contract that expired on February 1, 2020. Mr. Martin also resigned from the Board of Directors, effective February 3, 2020. Ms. Stafford remains a member of the Board of Directors.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nAs described in Note 11-Share-Based Compensation\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on August 8, 2018, we entered into an employment agreement with G. Kelly Martin, or the Martin Employment Agreement. The Martin Employment Agreement provided for 1,000,000 stock appreciation rights, or SARs, granted on a contingent basis that would have been considered irrevocably forfeited and voided in full if we failed to\nobtain stockholder approval for an amendment to the 2016 Incentive Award Plan, or the 2016 Plan. If such approval had not been obtained, we would have been required to pay Mr. Martin the cash equivalent of the value of the SARs.\nOn July 31, 2019, at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved a proposal to amend the 2016 Plan, to (i) increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan by 1,000,000 shares; and (ii) increase the limit on the number of awards that may be granted to any one person in any year. As such, with stockholder approval of the amendment to the 2016 Plan, the SARs detailed within the Martin Employment Agreement were no longer considered granted on a contingent basis. The SARs entitled Mr. Martin to a payment (in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of both) equal to the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of exercise less the exercise price of $3.80 per share. The SARs were to be deemed automatically exercised and settled as of February 1, 2020, provided Mr. Martin remained continuously employed with the Company through such date unless vesting was otherwise expressly accelerated pursuant to the Martin SAR Award. The SARs vested in full on February 1, 2020. On February 1, 2020, the fair market value of our common stock was $0.52 per share, and as such, the SARs expired unexercised and 1,000,000 shares became available to be granted under the 2016 Plan.\nEffective December 17, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Paula Brown Stafford, or the Amended and Restated Stafford Employment Agreement. On January 6, 2020, following our release of top-line results of the Phase 3 molluscum clinical program as provided by the Amended and Restated Stafford Employment Agreement, 600,000 SARs were granted to Ms. Stafford with an exercise price of $0.82 per share, or the Stafford SAR Award. The Stafford SAR Award was granted on a contingent basis and would have been considered irrevocably forfeited and voided in full if sufficient shares of our common stock were not available under the 2016 Plan or if we failed to obtain stockholder approval for amendments to the 2016 Plan at the next annual stockholders' meeting to provide sufficient shares for the Stafford SAR Award. If such approval had not been obtained, we would have been required to pay Ms. Stafford the cash equivalent of the value of the SARs. Such shares became available under the 2016 Plan on February 1, 2020 and the Stafford SAR Award was no longer considered granted on a contingent basis.\nBoard of Directors\nOn January 29, 2020, Dr. Eugene Sun, one of the members of our board of directors, notified us of his resignation from the board and any committees thereof, effective January 29, 2020.\nFinancial Overview\nSince our inception in 2006, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing our nitric oxide platform technology and resulting product candidates, including conducting preclinical and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We conduct these activities in a single operating segment. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and, to date, have funded our operations through a variety of sources described in further detail within the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section below. From inception through December 31, 2019, we have raised total equity and debt proceeds of $184.8 million to fund our operations.\nIn addition, through December 31, 2019, we have also generated additional liquidity and capital through other sources including (i) governmental research contracts and grants totaling $11.8 million; (ii) our licensing and supply arrangements with Sato, totaling $24.2 million, described below; and (iii) $37.0 million in proceeds from two funding transactions during the second quarter of 2019, also described below.\nThe approximately $24.2 million we have received from Sato from January 2017 through December 31, 2019 under our amended license agreement includes a $10.8 million upfront payment received following the execution of the agreement in January 2017, a $2.2 million payment related to the initiation of a Phase 1 trial in Japan in the third quarter of 2018, and $11.2 million of installment payments received following the October 2018 amendment to our amended license agreement with Sato.\nAs noted above, in April 2019 and May 2019, respectively, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek, which provided $25.0 million of immediate funding, and the Funding Agreement with Ligand, which provided $12.0 million of immediate funding. Reedy Creek was to provide an additional $10.0 million contingent upon our achievement of the primary end points in each of the two SB206 Phase 3 clinical trials no later than March 31, 2020. Based on the top line efficacy results from the Phase 3 SB206 program released in January 2020, we understand that Reedy Creek will not be paying us the contingent $10.0 million of additional funding.\nAs also noted above, in August 2019, we entered into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock at our request from time to time during the 30-\nmonth term of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. The aggregate amount that we may raise through sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement is subject to certain limitations including, but not limited to: (i) the number of shares that may be sold will be limited to 5,211,339 shares, representing 19.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock on August 30, 2019, if the average price paid for all shares issued under the agreement is less than $2.17; and (ii) on any purchase date, the closing sale price of our common stock must be greater than or equal to $0.25. As of December 31, 2019, we had sold an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $2.49 per share under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. As of January 31, 2020, we had sold an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $1.19 per share under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. These amounts, combined with the 345,622 shares issued as part of the commitment fee related to the agreement's execution, leads to a total of 1,345,622 shares issued to Aspire Capital under the agreement as of January 31, 2020.\nTo date, we have focused our funding activities on equity, debt and strategic relationships. However, other historical forms of funding have included payments received from licensing and supply arrangements, as well as government research contracts.\nWe have never generated revenue from product sales and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $203.7 million. We incurred net losses of $30.6 million and $12.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses in the future as we conduct our planned operating activities. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval from the FDA for our clinical-stage product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we and/or our commercial partners would expect to incur significant expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution.\nWe expect that we will continue to incur substantial expenses as we continue, subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020, to commence an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2020 and fund our operations. At present, we have temporarily suspended development activities and taken measures to reduce our expenses. Presently, we only have sufficient cash to fund our operations until the early part of the second quarter of 2020. As a result, we need substantial additional funding to support our planned and future operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs. Adequate future funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The current market value of our common stock may negatively impact funding options and the acceptability of funding terms. Additionally, we expect future advancement of our product candidates to occur after the formation of partnering, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships or through equity or debt financings. Our failure to enter into such relationships, or our failure to obtain sufficient additional funds on acceptable terms as and when needed could cause us to alter or reduce our planned operating activities, including but not limited to delaying, reducing, terminating or eliminating planned product candidate development activities, to conserve our cash and cash equivalents or we may need to dissolve and liquidate our assets or seek protection under bankruptcy laws. Such actions could delay development timelines and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and market valuation. If we are forced to terminate or eliminate our product development programs, wind down our operations, liquidate or seek bankruptcy protection, it is unclear to what extent we will be able to pay our obligations, and, accordingly, it is further unclear whether and to what extent any resources would be available for distributions to our stockholders, whereby, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment. If we are forced to terminate or eliminate our product development programs or pursue other strategic alternatives or corporate transactions, there can be no assurance that such actions would result in any additional stockholder value. Alternatively, we may seek to engage in one or more potential transactions, such as the sale of our company, or sale or divestiture of some of our assets, such as a sale of our dermatology platform assets, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such a transaction or transactions on a timely basis or at all or on terms that are favorable to us. As further discussed in our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nPlease refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion of our current liquidity and our future funding needs.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nLicense and collaboration revenue consists of the amortization of certain fixed and variable consideration under the Amended Sato Agreement, that (i) has been received to date in the form of upfront and milestone payments; or (ii) are future, non-contingent milestone payments that become payable upon the earlier occurrence of specified fixed dates in the future or the achievement of specified milestone events.\nThis consideration is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated performance period of approximately 7.5 years, from February 2017 through the third quarter of 2024. We monitor and reassess the estimated performance period for\npurposes of revenue recognition during each reporting period. We expect to reassess the estimated performance period during the first quarter of 2020, as we consider how the combined SB204 and SB206 development program timeline in Japan may potentially be affected by various factors, including (i) the recent results from our SB206 Phase 3 trials in the U.S., including but not limited to top-line efficacy results announced in January 2020, (ii) our plans and timelines for potential further clinical development of SB206 in the U.S., which is subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020, and (iii) our in-house drug manufacturing capabilities and the progression of our manufacturing technology transfer projects with third-party contract manufacturing organizations. Therefore, if the duration of the combined SB204 and SB206 development program timeline is affected by the establishment or subsequent adjustments to a mutually agreed upon SB204 and SB206 development plan in the Japan territory, we will adjust its estimated performance period for revenue recognition purposes accordingly, as needed.\nThe material terms of the Amended Sato Agreement and related revenue recognition are described above and within Note 4-Licensing Arrangements\u201d and Note 5 -Revenue Recognition\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernment research contracts and grant revenue relates to the research and development of our nitric oxide platform for preclinical advancement of NCEs and formulations related to potential treatments for illnesses in the women's health field. Revenue related to conditional government contracts and grants is recognized when qualifying expenses are incurred.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nSince our inception, we have focused our resources on our research and development activities, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for our product candidates. Research and development expenses, including those paid to third parties for which there is no alternative use, are expensed as they are incurred. Research and development expenses include:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants to conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs to acquire, develop and manufacture supplies for clinical trials and preclinical studies at our facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs to establish drug substance and drug product manufacturing capabilities with external contract manufacturing organizations and to enhance drug delivery device technologies through partnerships with technology manufacturing vendors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>legal and other professional fees related to compliance with FDA requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>licensing fees and milestone payments incurred under license agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>salaries and related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our research and development functions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities, utilities, equipment and other supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> From inception through December 31, 2019, we have incurred approximately $162.1 million in research and development expenses to develop, expand or otherwise improve our nitric oxide platform and resulting product candidates, as well as costs incurred to generate research and development services revenue. This amount is net of $8.2 million of contra-research and development expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing amortization of the liability related to the $12.0 million of funding received from Ligand to pursue the development and regulatory approval of SB206. The calculation used to recognize the ratable amortization of this liability includes an estimate of the total cost to progress the SB206 program to a regulatory approval in the U.S. During the first quarter of 2020, we expect to reassess this estimate and will take into consideration how such estimated costs may potentially be affected by recent development program events, as well as developmental and operational evaluations currently taking place.\nFor additional information about the Funding Agreement with Ligand, please see Note 6-Research and Development Arrangements\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below sets forth our research and development expenses incurred for external clinical programs and the related product candidates, and other research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Other research and development expenses include: (i) all preclinical program and development costs, including WH504 and WH602, (ii) manufacturing capability and campaign costs, (iii) external costs to establish drug substance and drug product\nmanufacturing capabilities at third-party CMOs, (iv) facility and infrastructure costs, and (v) costs related to all research and development salaries and related personnel costs.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>External clinical programs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SB204\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SB206\n</td> <td>7,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SB208\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SB414\n</td> <td>1,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other research and development\n</td> <td>15,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amount shown net of $8.2 million of contra-research and development expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, related to the Funding Agreement with Ligand described in Note 6-Research and Development Arrangements\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> During the year ended December 31, 2019, our major clinical development activities were primarily associated with our SB206 molluscum program, where we completed our Phase 2 clinical program activities, held an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, and commenced the Phase 3 development program for molluscum, including the initiation and progression of two pivotal clinical trials. We expect that for the foreseeable future, the substantial majority of our research and development efforts will be focused on the completion our current Phase 3 clinical program activities related to SB206 and, subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020, additional costs related to one potential additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial with SB206 for molluscum.\nWe expect to incur substantial research and development expenses in the future as we develop our clinical product candidates. In particular, subject to obtaining additional capital resources or strategic partnership arrangements, we expect to continue to incur substantial external development service provider fees and other research and development costs in 2020 to: (i) complete the SB206 molluscum Phase 3 program, including ancillary supporting trials and studies; (ii) wind down our SB414 atopic dermatitis Phase 2 trial preparatory activities; (iii) conduct certain API manufacturing capability transfer activities to our external third-party CMO; and (iv) progress certain drug product manufacturing capability transfer activities to Orion. We expect to incur substantial costs in 2020 associated with our research and development personnel and our in-house facility and manufacturing capabilities that support the aforementioned external development activities. We may decide to revise our development and operating plans or the related timing, depending on information we learn through our research and development activities, our ability to access additional capital, our ability to enter into strategic arrangements and our financial priorities.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to complete the remaining development of our current product candidates or any future product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates. See the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including share-based compensation expenses for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate development and other administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include allocated depreciation and facility-related costs, legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, insurance coverage and professional services fees for auditing, tax, general legal, business development, litigation defense and other corporate and administrative services.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial general and administrative expenses in 2020 in support of our operating activities and as necessary to operate in a public company environment. Significant general and administrative expenses associated with operations in a public company environment include legal, accounting, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, directors' and officers' liability insurance premiums and investor relations activities. We experienced a decrease in litigation defense fees during 2019 as we concluded that the putative stockholder class action lawsuits that were filed in November 2017, which have since been dismissed by the court with prejudice, are substantially complete.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of (i) fair value adjustments to our warrant liability; (ii) interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents; (iii) lease interest expense on our primary facility lease financing obligation during 2018 prior to the January 1, 2019 adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and (iv) other miscellaneous income and expenses. We expect continued fluctuations in the fair value of the warrant liability, based primarily on fluctuations in the market value of our common stock.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government research contracts and grants revenue\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development services revenue\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>4,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,095\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>25,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>10,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,095\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>35,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(30,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,561\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(120\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,047\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of warrant liability\n</td> <td>(264\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,830\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(102\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,841\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,641\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,968\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nLicense and collaboration revenue of $4.5 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was associated with our performance during the period and the related amortization of the non-refundable upfront and expected milestone payments under the Amended Sato Agreement.\nGovernment research contracts and grants revenue of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes (i) $0.3 million of revenue recognized related to the $1.1 million grant we received in September 2019 from the DoD's CDMRP as part of its Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program and (ii) $0.1 million of revenue recognized related to the $0.2 million grant received in September from the National Institutes of Health. For additional information regarding our government research contracts and grants revenue, see Note 5-Revenue Recognition\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net increase of $2.1 million, or 9% was primarily related to (i) a net $2.8 million increase in the SB206 program, (ii) a $0.2 million increase in other research and development expenses, (iii) a $0.1 million increase in our SB414 program due to the continued conduct of non-clinical studies during the third and fourth quarters of 2019, partially offset by (iv) a $0.9 million decrease in our SB204 program due to the completion of certain chemistry, manufacturing, and control activities that took place during the comparative period.\nIn the SB206 program, we experienced a $10.9 million increase in gross costs incurred due to the continued conduct of two Phase 3 pivotal trials and the initiation of other Phase 3 development activities, including ancillary supporting trials and studies, for the molluscum indication in the third quarter of 2019. This increase was partially offset by $8.2 million of contra-research and development expense representing the amortization of the liability related to the Funding Agreement with Ligand, which contributes to the clinical development and regulatory approval of SB206 for the treatment of molluscum.\nThe $0.2 million increase in other research and development expenses was primarily driven by costs associated with our increased utilization of third-party manufacturers and other strategic partners during 2019. Specifically, we experienced (i) a $2.1 million increase in service and support costs associated with our manufacturing technology and process engineering transfer projects ongoing with our third party API and drug product CMOs as well as a drug delivery device technology enhancement project ongoing with a technology manufacturing vendor, (ii) a $0.4 million increase in development service fees associated with preclinical development of new drug formulations and NCEs for use in the fields of women's health and GI, (iii) a $0.4 million increase in allocated rental expense following the January 1, 2019 adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which was reported as interest expense in previous reporting periods prior to adoption of Topic 842, and (iv) a $0.3 million increase in allocated non-cash depreciation expense primarily due to a Topic 842 adoption requirement that increased the depreciation rate on our leasehold improvement assets.\nThese other research and development expense increases were partially offset by (i) a $0.9 million decrease in internal facility and manufacturing costs associated with manufacturing campaigns and safety and quality activities occurring in the comparative 2018 period that did not recur or were significantly reduced in 2019 and (ii) a $2.0 million decrease in research and development personnel-related costs. The decrease in facility and manufacturing costs is comprised of (i) a $0.6 million decrease in equipment repair, maintenance and support costs and (ii) a $0.3 million decrease in manufacturing safety, quality and efficiency initiatives at our Morrisville, NC manufacturing facility. The decrease in personnel-related costs is comprised of (i) a $1.4 million decrease in recurring salary and benefit expenses due to reductions in research and development personnel between the comparative periods, (ii) a $0.6 million decrease in annual discretionary bonus compensation expense in 2019 as the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined that the associated corporate performance objectives were not achieved during 2019, (iii) a $0.4 million net decrease in non-cash performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by (iv) a $0.4 million discrete severance expense charge in the first quarter of 2019 associated with the departure of our former chief scientific officer. Non-cash performance based compensation included a $0.5 million decrease in stock option related compensation expense associated with (i) the forfeiture of stock options previously held by former officers and employees who departed the Company prior to or during 2019; and (ii) expense associated with the annual grant of stock option awards to all employees during 2018, which did not recur in 2019 after the establishment of the Tangible Stockholder Return Plan in the third quarter of 2018. This decrease was partially offset by a $0.1 million increase associated with the change in the fair value of the liability related to our Tangible Stockholder Return Plan, or the Performance Plan, which was established in the third quarter of 2018. The Performance Plan liability valuation increased during 2019 due to appreciation in our common stock's market price, which is a key input to the Performance Plan's valuation model.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of approximately $1.1 million, or 10% was primarily due to (i) a $0.9 million decrease in general and administrative personnel and related costs, (ii) a $0.7 million reduction in legal fees primarily related to litigation defense fees for the putative stockholder class action lawsuits incurred in 2018 that did not recur in 2019, partially offset by (iii) a $0.3 million increase in facility costs and (iv) a $0.2 million increase in insurance expense.\nThe $0.9 million decrease in general and administrative personnel and related costs is primarily due to (i) the expense recognition of a one-time signing bonus in the third quarter of 2018 of $0.6 million in accordance with the Martin Employment Agreement, (ii) a $0.2 million decrease in annual discretionary bonus compensation expense in 2019 as the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined that the associated corporate performance objectives were not achieved during 2019, and (iii) a decrease in salary and benefits costs of $0.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in non-cash stock compensation expense of $0.1 million.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income was approximately $47,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The other income decrease of approximately $15.8 million was due to the change in fair value of the warrant liability of $16.8 million, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in interest expense associated with our Morrisville, North Carolina facility lease. The decrease in interest expense is due to the adoption of Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, whereby we no longer report a portion of our lease costs as interest expense as of the adoption date.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a total cash and cash equivalents balance of $13.7 million and positive working capital of $2.8 million.\nSince our inception through December 31, 2019, we have financed our operations primarily with $184.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities, including $35.2 million in net proceeds from a public offering of common stock and accompanying warrants pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement and completed on January 9, 2018, or the January 2018 Offering, and $44.6 million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our 2016 initial public offering and $0.7 million in proceeds from the sale of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. In addition, through December 31, 2019, we have also generated additional liquidity and capital through other sources including (i) governmental research contracts and grants totaling $11.8 million; (ii) our licensing and supply arrangements with Sato Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Sato, totaling $24.2 million; and (iii) $37.0 million in proceeds from two funding transactions during the second quarter of 2019 described below.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we received an upfront payment of approximately $10.8 million following the execution of the Sato Agreement for the exclusive right to develop, use and sell SB204 in certain topical dosage forms in Japan for the treatment of acne vulgaris. In addition, we received a milestone payment of approximately $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, related to the initiation of a Phase 1 trial in Japan in the third quarter of 2018. Under the terms of the Sato Amendment which expanded the Sato Agreement to include SB206, we also received a payment of $2.2 million (or 0.25 billion JPY) in October 2018, a payment of $4.5 million (or 0.5 billion JPY) in March 2019, and a payment of $4.6 million (or 0.5 billion JPY) in November 2019, representing the three installments of an upfront payment of 1.25 billion JPY.\nAs also described below, in August 2019, we entered into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, and described below, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock at our request from time to time during the 30-month term of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement.\nAs described below, in late April 2019 and early May 2019, respectively, we entered into (i) the Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek, which provided $25.0 million of immediate funding; and (ii) the Funding Agreement with Ligand, which provided $12.0 million of immediate funding.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our planned operating needs into the early part of the second quarter of 2020. We will need substantial additional funding to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs. This projected cash runway excludes (i) potential costs associated with an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial, which is subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020, and (ii) any proceeds received subsequent to January 31, 2020 from potential future sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, described below, if available.\nOur ability to continue to operate our business, including our ability to advance our development programs, is dependent upon our ability to access additional sources of capital, including, but not limited to (i) non-dilutive sources, such as partnerships, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships; or (ii) equity or debt financings. Any issuance of equity or debt that could be convertible into equity would result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. We may revise our development and operating activities or their timing depending on the availability of additional funding, partnership opportunities and our financial priorities. Our assumptions and plans may change and could impact the magnitude and/or timing of development and operating expenses and therefore our cash runway. In addition, we have continued to explore both financial as well as strategic options in order to continue operations and to progress SB206 for the molluscum indication, subject to FDA feedback. Alternatively, we may seek to engage in one or more potential transactions, such as the sale of our company, or sale or divestiture of some of our assets, such as a sale of our dermatology platform assets, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such a transaction or transactions on a timely basis or at all or on terms that are favorable to us.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless, and until, we obtain regulatory approval of one of our current or future product candidates and achieve successful commercialization by a strategic partner or by ourselves. We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin any commercialization activities. We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\nAs we continue to endeavor to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new funding on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis, or at all. Our failure to obtain sufficient additional funds on acceptable terms as and when needed could cause us to alter or reduce our planned operating activities, including but not limited to delaying, reducing, terminating or eliminating planned product candidate development activities, to conserve our cash and cash equivalents or we may need to dissolve and liquidate our assets or seek protection under bankruptcy laws. Such actions could delay development timelines and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and market valuation. If we are forced to terminate or eliminate our product development programs, wind down our operations, liquidate or seek bankruptcy protection, it is unclear to what extent we will be able to pay our obligations, and, accordingly, it is further unclear whether and to what extent any resources would be available for distributions to our stockholders. A failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed, including the inability to utilize the amount available under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, could cause us to alter or reduce our planned operating activities to conserve our cash and cash equivalents, including but not limited to delaying planned activities directly related to or in support of product candidate development. Our anticipated expenditure levels may change if we adjust our current operating plan. Such actions could delay development timelines and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and market valuation. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $203.7 million and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including money market accounts. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with a view toward liquidity and capital preservation, and we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk.\nAspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement\nOn August 30, 2019, we entered into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock at our request from time to time during the 30-month term of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. The aggregate amount that we may raise through sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement is subject to certain limitations including, but not limited to: (i) the number of shares that may be sold will be limited to 5,211,339 shares, representing 19.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock on August 30, 2019, if the average price paid for all shares issued under the agreement is less than $2.17, which was the closing sale price of our common stock immediately preceding the execution of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement; and (ii) on any purchase date, the closing sale price of our common stock must be greater than or equal to $0.25.\nUnder the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, on any trading day we select, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to present Aspire Capital with a purchase notice, or the Purchase Notice, directing Aspire Capital (as principal) to purchase up to 100,000 shares of our common stock per business day, up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of our common stock, at a per share price, or the Purchase Price, equal to the lesser of (i) the lowest sale price of our common stock on the purchase date, or (ii) the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing sale prices for our common stock during the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the purchase date. The aggregate purchase price payable by Aspire Capital on any one purchase date may not exceed $0.5 million. In addition, on any date on which we submit a Purchase Notice to Aspire Capital in an amount equal to 100,000 shares and our stock price is not less than $0.25 per share, we can also, in our sole discretion, present Aspire Capital with a volume-weighted average price purchase notice, or a VWAP Purchase Notice, directing Aspire Capital to purchase an amount of our common stock equal to up to 30% of the aggregate shares of our common stock traded on its principal market on the next trading day, or the VWAP Purchase Date, as determined by us.\nThere are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, and we will control the timing and amount of sales of our common stock to Aspire Capital. Aspire Capital has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as directed by the Company in accordance with the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future financing transactions, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. In consideration for entering into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, concurrently with the\nexecution of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we issued to Aspire Capital 345,622 shares of our common stock as part of the commitment fee. The Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us any time, at our discretion, without any penalty or additional cost to us. Any proceeds we receive under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nRoyalty and Milestone Payments Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek Investments LLC\nOn April 29, 2019, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek, pursuant to which Reedy Creek provided us funding in an initial amount of $25.0 million, which we will use primarily to pursue the development, regulatory approval and commercialization (including through out-license agreements and other third-party arrangements) activities for SB206, for the treatment of molluscum, and advancing programmatically other activities with respect to SB414, for atopic dermatitis, and SB204, for acne. Reedy Creek was to provide $10.0 million of additional funding contingent upon our achievement of the primary endpoints in each of the two SB206 Phase 3 clinical trials no later than March 31, 2020. Based on the top line efficacy results from the Phase 3 SB206 program released in January 2020, we understand that Reedy Creek will not be paying us the contingent $10.0 million of additional funding.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will pay Reedy Creek ongoing quarterly payments, calculated based on an applicable percentage per product of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments received by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for the products in the United States, Mexico or Canada, net of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments paid by us to third parties pursuant to any agreements under which we have in-licensed intellectual property with respect to the products.\nThe applicable percentage used for determining the ongoing quarterly payments, applied to amounts received directly by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for each product, ranges from 10% for SB206 to 20% for SB414 and SB204. However, the agreement provides that the applicable percentage for each product will be 25% for fees or milestone payments received by us (but not royalty payments received by us) until Reedy Creek has received payments under the Purchase Agreement equal to the total funding amount provided by Reedy Creek under the Purchase Agreement. If we decide to commercialize any product on its own following regulatory approval, as opposed to commercializing through an out-license agreement or other third-party arrangement, we will be obligated to pay Reedy Creek a low single digits royalty on net sales of the products.\nDevelopment Funding and Royalties Agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\nOn May 4, 2019, we entered into the Funding Agreement with Ligand, pursuant to which Ligand provided us funding of $12.0 million, which we used to pursue the development and regulatory approval of SB206, for the treatment of molluscum.\nPursuant to the Funding Agreement, we will pay Ligand up to $20.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement by us of certain regulatory and commercial milestones associated with SB206 or any product that incorporates or uses NVN1000, the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our clinical stage product candidates, for the treatment of molluscum. In addition to the milestone payments, we will pay Ligand tiered royalties ranging from 7% to 10% based on annual aggregate net sales of the products in the United States, Mexico or Canada.\nExpansion of Partnership with Sato in Japanese Territory\nOn October 5, 2018, we and Sato entered into the Sato Amendment. The initial Sato Agreement had focused on the development and commercialization of SB204 for the treatment of acne vulgaris in Japan. The Sato Amendment also provides Sato with the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize SB206 and related dosage forms for the treatment of viral skin infections, including but not limited to molluscum contagiosum and external genital warts, in Japan. Under the terms of the Sato Amendment, we received an upfront payment from Sato totaling 1.25 billion JPY (approximately $11.3 million USD) to be paid in three installments over a 12 months period. We received the first installment of 0.25 billion JPY (approximately $2.2 million USD) in October 2018, the second installment of 0.5 billion JPY (approximately $4.5 million USD) in March 2019 and the third installment of 0.5 billion JPY (approximately $4.6 million USD) in November 2019. The Sato Amendment also provides for an aggregate of 1.0 billion JPY in additional non-contingent milestone payments that become payable upon the earlier occurrence of specified fixed dates in the future or the achievement of specified milestone events.\nJanuary 2018 Offering\nOn January 9, 2018, we completed a public offering of our common stock and warrants under our effective shelf registration statement. We sold an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $3.80 per share of common stock and accompanying warrant. The warrant exercise price is $4.66 per share and the warrants will expire four years from the date of issuance. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $35.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $2.8 million.\nThe warrants sold in the January 2018 Offering are classified as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the warrant liability is recorded at fair value and is re-valued each reporting period, with adjustments to fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of January 9, 2018, the date the warrants were issued, the warrants were recorded at fair value which approximated $17.8 million. The fair value of the warrants decreased to approximately $1.2 million as of December 31, 2018, which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash unrealized gain of $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The fair value of the warrants increased to approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash unrealized loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in the fair value of the warrant liability and the corresponding unrealized loss/gain recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, is primarily due to the fluctuations in the market price of our underlying common stock from the date of issuance, in addition to fluctuations in the other valuation model inputs. We will continue to adjust the fair value of the warrant liability each reporting period during the remaining contractual life of the warrants and the resulting non-cash unrealized gains or losses may have a significant effect on our reported net losses in future periods. The warrants' terms and accounting treatment are described further in Note 10-Warrants\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have not listed the warrants on an exchange but warrant holders have transacted through dealer networks within the OTC market on a sporadic basis. The transaction price range observed in the OTC market includes prices that are higher and lower than those estimated using the valuation model that approximates a Monte Carlo simulation model, which estimated a fair value of $0.15 and $1.78 per warrant as of December 31, 2019 and January 9, 2018, respectively. Because of the limited trading volumes currently occurring in the OTC market, the published transaction prices cannot be used to estimate fair value of the warrant liability under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. However, we believe the pricing disparity observed between our fair value estimate and the limited OTC market transactions indicates that the estimated fair value of the warrant liability value is subject to change in the future and may not necessarily be representative of what a warrant holder can expect to receive or an interested investor can expect to pay in the marketplace.\nPrimary Facility Lease Financing\nOur approximately 51,000 square foot leased facility in Morrisville, North Carolina serves as our corporate headquarters and sole research, development and manufacturing facility. We entered into the ten-year, non-cancellable lease agreement in 2016, currently have approximately six and a half years remaining under the lease term and currently have approximately $8.5 million in remaining minimum lease payments.\nAs part of our broader strategic plan to shift our operating cost structure characteristics from fixed to variable, we are actively pursuing efforts to reduce or offset our remaining fixed lease obligation. We have engaged a commercial real estate broker and are currently marketing our Morrisville, North Carolina headquarters facility for sublease or assignment.\nIn July 2018, the Company and a third-party tenant entered into a sublease of approximately 6,400 square feet of office space, or approximately 12% of total facility square footage, at our Morrisville, North Carolina headquarters. In October 2019, we executed a termination agreement with the subtenant for this sublease, with an effective date of December 31, 2019.\nWe assess the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2019, we concluded there were no such events or changes in circumstances requiring review of the carrying amount of the Company's long-lived assets.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,876\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(422\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,058\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>25,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $19.9 million and consisted primarily of a net loss of $30.6 million, with adjustments for non-cash amounts related primarily to depreciation expense of $2.0 million, share-based compensation expense of $1.8 million, an increase in fair value of warrant liability of $0.3 million, and a favorable change related to changes in other operating assets and liabilities of $6.6 million. The favorable net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $12.0 million increase related to the advanced payment for the research and development service obligation associated with the Funding Agreement with Ligand, offset by a $8.2 million decrease in research and development service obligation liabilities related to the amortization of the liability associated with Ligand, a $4.5 million increase in deferred revenue following the receipt of an additional upfront installment payment under the Amended Sato Agreement during the first quarter of 2019, a $0.4 million increase in accounts payable and a $0.5 million increase in accrued outside research and development services. The increase in accounts payable and accruals was primarily related to the Phase 3 development program for molluscum and timing of payments related to our operating activities. These favorable changes were partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in accrued compensation following the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors' determination that the associated corporate performance objectives were not achieved during 2019, and a decrease in other operating assets and liabilities totaling $1.5 million. The decrease in other operating assets and liabilities include an increase in prepaid expenses and contracts and grants receivable and a decrease in other long-term liabilities, primarily related to amortization of lease liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $28.6 million and consisted primarily of a net loss of $12.7 million, with adjustments for non-cash amounts related primarily to depreciation expense of $1.7 million, share-based compensation expense of $2.2 million, decrease in fair value of warrant liability of $16.6 million and a net decrease in other operating assets and liabilities of $3.4 million. The net decrease in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in accrued compensation following the payment of annual employee bonuses in the first quarter of 2018, a $1.3 million decrease in other accrued expenses following the payment of various accrued expenses during the period, including $0.2 million in travel costs paid to Malin (as reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses for our Chief Executive Officer and a number of Malin employees who supported us with certain strategic and tactical initiatives and activities in 2017), and a $1.6 million decrease in deferred revenue associated with the continued recognition of licensing revenues from the Amended Sato Agreement during 2018. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable change in prepaid expenses and other current assets, other assets and accounts payable of $0.2 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $0.4 million, which primarily related to purchases of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements at our facility in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 million, which primarily related to purchases of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements at our facility in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $25.8 million and consisted of $25.0 million of funding received pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek, $0.7 million of proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement and $0.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $35.4 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from the January 2018 Offering after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nCapital Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a total cash and cash equivalents balance of $13.7 million and positive working capital of $2.8 million. As of the date of this filing, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our planned operating needs into the early part of the second quarter of 2020. This projected cash runway excludes (i) potential costs associated with an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial, which is subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020, and (ii) any proceeds received subsequent to January 31, 2020 from potential future sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, described above, if available.\nWe are utilizing our existing capital resources to fund the ongoing and near-term operating and development activities, as described in the Overview\u201d section above. We will need substantial additional funding to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs. Therefore, we will need to secure additional capital and/or delay, defer, or reduce our cash expenditures by the early part of the second quarter of 2020, including those associated with our product development programs, or we may need to dissolve and liquidate our assets or seek protection under bankruptcy laws. If we are forced to terminate or eliminate our product development programs, wind down our operations, liquidate or seek bankruptcy protection, it is unclear to what extent we will be able to pay our obligations, and, accordingly, it is further unclear whether and to what extent any resources would be available for distributions to our stockholders. Alternatively, we may seek to engage in one or more potential transactions, such as the sale of our company, or sale or divestiture of some of our assets, such as a sale of our dermatology platform assets, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such a transaction or transactions on a timely basis or at all or on terms that are favorable to us.\nOur ability to continue to operate our business, including our ability to advance our development programs, is dependent upon our ability to access additional sources of capital, including, but not limited to (i) non-dilutive sources, such as partnerships, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships; or (ii) equity or debt financings. Any issuance of equity or debt that could be convertible into equity would result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. We may revise our development and operating activities or their timing depending on the availability of additional funding, partnership opportunities and our financial priorities. Our assumptions and plans may change and could impact the magnitude and/or timing of development and operating expenses and therefore our cash runway. We continue to explore other potential non-dilutive business development activities around the developmental and commercial rights to the clinical-stage assets in our platform, including various geographic and indication-specific opportunities.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless, and until, we obtain regulatory approval of one of our current or future product candidates and achieve successful commercialization by a strategic partner or by ourselves. We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin any commercialization activities. We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\nAs we continue to attempt to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis, or at all. A failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed, including the inability to utilize the amount available under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, could cause us to alter or reduce our planned operating activities to conserve our cash and cash equivalents, including but not limited to delaying planned activities directly related to or in support of product candidate development. Our anticipated expenditure levels may change if we adjust our current operating plan. Such actions could delay development timelines and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and market valuation. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $203.7 million and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount or timing of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the initiation, progress, timing, costs, results, and evaluation of results of trials for our clinical-stage product candidates, including trials conducted by us or potential future partners;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the progress, timing, costs and results of development and preclinical study activities relating to other potential applications of our nitric oxide platform;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to enter into strategic relationships to support the continued development of certain product candidates and the success of those arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our success in optimizing the size and capability of our current manufacturing facility and related processes to meet our strategic objectives;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our success in the technical transfer of methods and processes related to our drug substance and drug product manufacturing with our current and/or potential future contract manufacturing partners;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the occurrence and timing of potential development and regulatory milestones achieved by Sato, our licensee for SB204 and SB206 in Japan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the terms and timing of any future collaborations, licensing, consulting, financing or other arrangements that we may enter into;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>defending against intellectual property related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs associated with any potential future securities litigation, and the outcome of that litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the extent to which we in-license or acquire other products and technologies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from commercial sales or out licensing of our product candidates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities\nPrimary Facility Lease\nWe entered into a lease agreement in August 2015 for a facility totaling approximately 51,000 square feet in Morrisville, North Carolina and began to occupy and utilize the facility in October 2016. The term of the lease commenced April 1, 2016, and terminates June 2026. The remaining estimated lease payments for this facility over the term of the lease are approximately $8.5 million. We have an option to extend this facility lease by five years upon completion of the initial lease term.\nAs part of our broader strategic plan to shift our operating cost structure characteristics from fixed to variable, we are actively pursuing efforts to reduce or offset our remaining fixed lease obligation. We have engaged a commercial real estate broker and are currently marketing our Morrisville, North Carolina headquarters facility for sublease or assignment.\nIn July 2018, the Company and a third-party tenant entered into a sublease of approximately 6,400 square feet of office space, or approximately 12% of total facility square footage, at our Morrisville, North Carolina headquarters. In October 2019, we executed a termination agreement with the subtenant for this sublease, with an effective date of December 31, 2019.\nAmended Sato Agreement\nPursuant to the Amended Sato Agreement, we are obligated to supply Sato with all quantities of licensed products required by Sato for their development activities in Japan. As part of the Amended Sato Agreement, we and Sato also agreed to negotiate a commercial supply agreement pursuant to which we or a third-party contract manufacturer would be the exclusive supplier to Sato of the API of licensed products for the commercial manufacture of licensed products in the licensed territory. Additionally, we have agreed to perform certain oversight, review and supporting activities for Sato, including: (i) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain marketing approval of SB204 and SB206 in the U.S, (ii) sharing all future scientific information we may obtain during the term of the Amended Sato Agreement pertaining to SB204 and SB206, (iii) performing certain additional preclinical studies if such studies are deemed necessary by the Japanese regulatory authority, up to and not to exceed a total cost of $1.0 million, and (iv) participating in a joint committee that oversees, reviews, and approves Sato's development and commercialization activities under the Amended Sato Agreement. Additionally, we have granted Sato the option to use our\ntrademarks in connection with the commercialization of licensed products in the licensed territory for no additional consideration, subject to our approval of such use. We cannot estimate if, when or in what amounts such payments will become due under the Amended Sato Agreement.\nThe intellectual property rights granted to Sato under the Amended Sato Agreement include certain intellectual property rights which we have licensed from UNC. Under our license agreement with UNC described in Note 3-Research and Development Licenses\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are obligated to pay UNC a running royalty percentage in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products, including net sales that may be generated by Sato. Additionally, we are obligated to make payments to UNC that represent the portion of the Sato upfront and milestone payments that were estimated to be directly attributable to the UNC intellectual property rights included in the license to Sato.\nWe had also previously entered into an agreement with a third party to assist us in exploring the licensing opportunity which led to the execution of the Sato Agreement. We are obligated to pay the third party a low-single-digit percentage of all upfront and milestone payments the Company receives from Sato under the Amended Sato Agreement.\nWe have accrued certain fees that we will pay to UNC and a third party in the future upon receipt of non-contingent installment and milestone payments from Sato. As of December 31, 2019, we had recorded capitalized contract acquisition costs of $0.5 million in other assets and had accrued $0.2 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 we paid fees totaling $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nSee Note 5-Revenue Recognition\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Amended Sato Agreement.\nAmendments to Sublicense Agreements with KNOW Bio\nPursuant to the terms of the amendments to the KNOW Bio Agreements that we entered in October 2017, we re-acquired from KNOW Bio exclusive, worldwide rights under certain U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications controlled by us as of the execution date of the KNOW Bio Agreements, and patents and patent applications which became controlled by us during the three years immediately following the execution date of the KNOW Bio Agreements, directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, to develop and commercialize products for all diagnostic, therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative uses for any disease, condition or disorder caused by certain oncoviruses, or the Oncovirus Field. KNOW Bio also granted to us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under any patents and patent applications which became controlled by KNOW Bio during the three years immediately following the execution date of the KNOW Bio Agreements and directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, but not towards medical devices, to develop and commercialize products for use in the Oncovirus Field. Additionally, KNOW Bio agreed that KNOW Bio would not commercialize any products in the Oncovirus Field during the first three years following the execution date of the KNOW Bio Agreements. The three-year period in which new patents and patent applications are added to the exclusive license and the three-year term of the commercialization non-compete both expired on December 29, 2018.\nIn addition to the $0.3 million non-refundable upfront payment we made upon execution of the KNOW Bio Amendments, we are obligated to make the following contingent payments in exchange for the rights granted to us in the Oncovirus Field:\nFor products that incorporate a certain nitric oxide-releasing composition specified in the KNOW Bio Amendments and (i) are covered by KNOW Bio patents or (ii) materially use or incorporate know-how of KNOW Bio or us related to such composition that is created during the three years immediately following the execution date of the KNOW Bio Agreements, or the Covered Products, we must make the following payments to KNOW Bio:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>o\n</td> <td>A milestone payment upon the first time each Covered Product is approved by the FDA for marketing in the Oncovirus Field;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>o\n</td> <td>A royalty in the low single digits on net sales of Covered Products in the Oncovirus Field until the later of the expiration of the KNOW Bio patents covering the applicable Covered Product or the expiration of regulatory exclusivity on the applicable Covered Product; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>o\n</td> <td>In the event we sublicense the rights to a Covered Product to a third party in the Oncovirus Field, the Company must pay KNOW Bio a low double-digit percentage of any clinical development or NDA approval milestones we receive from the sublicensee for the Covered Product in the Oncovirus Field.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNitricil is not the nitric oxide-releasing composition specified in the KNOW Bio Amendments as the subject of the foregoing payments. As such, products based on Nitricil are not subject to the foregoing milestone, royalty and sublicensing payment obligations.\nThe rights granted to us in the Oncovirus Field in the KNOW Bio Amendments continue for so long as there is a valid patent claim under the KNOW Bio Agreements, and upon expiration continue on a perpetual non-exclusive basis, and are subject to the termination rights of KNOW Bio and us that are set forth in the KNOW Bio Agreements. In addition, under the KNOW Bio Amendments, KNOW Bio may terminate the rights granted to us in the Oncovirus Field if: (i) we do not file a first IND with the FDA for a product in the Oncovirus Field by October 2020; or (ii) we do not file a first NDA with the FDA by October 2025 for a product in the Oncovirus Field and does not otherwise have any active clinical programs related to the Oncovirus Field at such time. We also obtained a three-year exclusive option, subject to payment of separate option exercise fees, to include up to four additional specified oncoviruses in the Oncovirus Field.\nSee Note 2-KNOW Bio, LLC\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the sublicense agreement and our assessment of KNOW Bio under the variable interest consolidation model pursuant to FASB ASC 810, Consolidation.\nRoyalty and Milestone Payments Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek Investments LLC\nOn April 29, 2019, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek, pursuant to which Reedy Creek provided us funding in an initial amount of $25.0 million, which we will use primarily to pursue the development, regulatory approval and commercialization (including through out-license agreements and other third party arrangements) activities for SB206, for the treatment of molluscum, and advancing programmatically other activities with respect to SB414, for atopic dermatitis, and SB204, for acne. Reedy Creek was to provide $10.0 million of additional funding contingent upon our achievement of the primary endpoints in each of the two SB206 Phase 3 clinical trials no later than March 31, 2020. Based on the top line efficacy results from the Phase 3 SB206 program released in January 2020, we understand that Reedy Creek will not be paying us the contingent $10.0 million of additional funding.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will pay Reedy Creek ongoing quarterly payments, calculated based on an applicable percentage per product of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments received by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for the products in the United States, Mexico or Canada, net of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments paid by us to third parties pursuant to any agreements under which we have in-licensed intellectual property with respect to the products.\nThe applicable percentage used for determining the ongoing quarterly payments, applied to amounts received directly by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for each product, ranges from 10% for SB206 to 20% for SB414 and SB204. However, the agreement provides that the applicable percentage for each product will be 25% for fees or milestone payments received by us (but not royalty payments received by us) until Reedy Creek has received payments under the Purchase Agreement equal to the total funding amount provided by Reedy Creek under the Purchase Agreement. If we decide to commercialize any product on its own following regulatory approval, as opposed to commercializing through an out-license agreement or other third-party arrangement, we will be obligated to pay Reedy Creek a low single digits royalty on net sales of the products.\nDevelopment Funding and Royalties Agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\nOn May 4, 2019, we entered into the Funding Agreement with Ligand, pursuant to which Ligand provided us funding of $12.0 million, which we used to pursue the development and regulatory approval of SB206, for the treatment of molluscum.\nPursuant to the Funding Agreement, we will pay Ligand up to $20.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement by us of certain regulatory and commercial milestones associated with SB206 or any product that incorporates or uses NVN1000, the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our clinical stage product candidates, for the treatment of molluscum. In addition to the milestone payments, we will pay Ligand tiered royalties ranging from 7% to 10% based on annual aggregate net sales of the products in the United States, Mexico or Canada.\nTangible Stockholder Return Plan, or Performance Plan\nIn August 2018, our board of directors approved and established the Performance Plan. We believe that the Performance Plan will help us attract, retain and incentivize the highly qualified resources that are and will be necessary to execute on our operating strategy. Executive management and the board of directors believe this plan clearly and directly ties long-term employee incentive compensation to specific, significant increases in our underlying common stock price and thus directly aligns employee and stockholder objectives. Unlike our historical practice of providing long-term incentives to our employees\nthrough annual stock option grants under the 2016 Plan at the then current market price of our common stock, the Performance Plan only provides for employees to receive long-term incentive compensation payments if the established stock price targets ($11.17 per share and $25.45 per share, subject to adjustment) are achieved.\nThe Performance Plan is tiered, with two separate tranches, each of which has a distinct share price target (measured as the average publicly traded share price of our common stock on the Nasdaq stock exchange for a thirty consecutive trading day period) that will trigger a distinct fixed bonus pool. The share price target for the first tranche is $11.17 per share. The share price target for the second tranche is $25.45 per share. The related contingent bonus pools for the first and second tranches are $25.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. The compensation committee has discretion to distribute the bonus pool related to each tranche among eligible participants by establishing individual minimum bonus amounts before, as well as by distributing the remainder of the applicable pool after, the achievement of each tranche specific share price target. Otherwise, if we do not achieve one or both related share price targets, as defined, no portion of the bonus pools will be paid.\nThe Performance Plan provides for the bonus pool to generally be paid in the form of cash. However, the compensation committee has discretion to pay any bonus award under the Performance Plan in the form of cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, provided that our board and stockholders have approved the reservation of such shares of our common stock for such payment. The share price targets will be adjusted in the event of any stock splits, cash dividends, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations, reclassifications, or similar events. In addition, in the event of a change in control, the plan provides that a bonus pool will become due and payable to participants on a pro rata basis, as calculated and determined by the compensation committee based upon our progress toward the share price target as of the date of the change in control and subject to adjustment by the compensation committee as permitted under the plan.\nThe Performance Plan was effective immediately upon approval, expires on March 1, 2022, and covers all employees, including our executive officers, consultants and other persons deemed eligible by our compensation committee. The Performance Plan was subsequently amended and restated to reflect minor changes in the timing for establishing minimum bonus amounts.\nSee Note 12-Tangible Stockholder Return Plan\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Performance Plan.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nOn August 8, 2018, we entered into the Martin Employment Agreement with G. Kelly Martin. The Martin Employment Agreement provided for 1,000,000 SARs granted on a contingent basis that would have been irrevocably forfeited and voided in full if we failed to obtain stockholder approval for an amendment to the 2016 Plan to allow such stock award. If such approval had not been obtained, we would have been required to pay Mr. Martin the cash equivalent of the value of the SARs.\nOn July 31, 2019, at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved a proposal to amend the 2016 Plan, to (i) increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan by 1,000,000 shares; and (ii) increase the limit on the number of awards that may be granted to any one person in any year. As such, with stockholder approval of the amendment to the 2016 Plan, the SARs detailed within the Martin Employment Agreement were no longer considered granted on a contingent basis.\nThe SARs entitled Mr. Martin to a payment (in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of both) equal to the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of exercise less the exercise price of $3.80 per share. The SARs were to be deemed automatically exercised and settled as of February 1, 2020, provided Mr. Martin remained continuously employed with us through such date unless vesting was otherwise expressly accelerated pursuant to the Martin SAR Award. The SARs vested in full on February 1, 2020. On February 1, 2020, the fair market value of our common stock was $0.52 per share, and as such, the SARS expired unexercised and 1,000,000 shares became available to be granted under the 2016 Plan.\nEffective December 17, 2019, we entered into the Amended and Restated Stafford Employment Agreement with Paula Brown Stafford. On January 6, 2020, as provided by the Amended and Restated Stafford Employment Agreement, 600,000 SARs were granted to Ms. Stafford with an exercise price of $0.82 per share, following our release of top-line results of our Phase 3 molluscum clinical program. The Stafford SAR Award was granted on a contingent basis and would have been considered irrevocably forfeited and voided in full if sufficient shares of our common stock were not available under the 2016 Plan or if we failed to obtain stockholder approval for amendments to the 2016 Plan at the next annual stockholders' meeting to provide sufficient shares for the Stafford SAR Award. If such shares were not available, we would have been required to pay Ms. Stafford the cash equivalent of the value of the SARs. Such shares became available under the 2016 Plan on February 1, 2020 and the SARs were no longer considered granted on a contingent basis.\nSee Note 11-Share-Based Compensation\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the SARs.\nOther\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for preclinical research studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.\nNet Operating Loss and Research and Development Tax Credit Carryforwards\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately of $165.6 million and $165.1 million, respectively. The net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2028 and 2023 for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. We have research and development tax credits of approximately $8.1 million to offset future federal taxes. These credits begin to expire in 2028.\nWe record a valuation allowance to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not recognize some or all of the deferred tax assets. We have had a history of net losses since inception, and, as a result, we have established a 100% valuation allowance of $54.4 million for our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019. If circumstances change and we determine that we will be able to realize some or all of these net deferred tax assets in the future, we will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance.\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions which limit the ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards in the case of certain events including significant changes in ownership interests. In accordance with Section 382 of the Code, a change in equity ownership of greater than 50% within a three-year period results in an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards created during the tax periods prior to the change in ownership. We have not determined whether ownership changes exceeding this threshold, including our IPO and the January 2018 offering, have occurred. If a change in equity ownership has occurred which exceeds the Section 382 threshold, a portion of our NOL carryforwards may be limited. If our net operating loss carryforwards are limited, and we have taxable income which exceeds the permissible yearly net operating loss carryforwards, we would incur a federal income tax liability even though net operating loss carryforwards would be available in future years.\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act)\nIn April 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company.\u201d As an emerging growth company,\u201d we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. We have chosen to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company\u201d we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer's compensation to median employee compensation. We may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of 2021. However, if certain events occur prior to such date, including if we become a large accelerated filer,\u201d our annual gross revenue equals or exceeds $1.07 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to such date.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements that we have adopted or are currently evaluating are described in detail within Note 1-Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nThere were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nLeases\nWe lease office space and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements. Prior to January 1, 2019, we applied the accounting guidance in ASC 840, Leases, to our lease agreements. The leases were reviewed for classification as operating or capital leases. For operating leases, rent was recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease period. For capital leases, we recorded the leased asset with a corresponding liability and amortized the asset over the lease term. Payments were recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on the then-outstanding remaining liability.\nEffective January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) using the modified retrospective transition method and established our lease accounting policy pursuant to this new standard. We initially applied the transition provisions at January 1, 2019, which allowed us to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840 for periods prior to 2019. Based on the new guidance, we assess all arrangements, that convey the right to control the use of property, plant and equipment, at inception, to determine if it is, or contains, a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in that arrangement. For those leases identified, we determine the lease classification, recognition, and measurement at the lease commencement date. For arrangements that contain a lease we: (i) identify lease and non-lease components; (ii) determine the consideration in the contract; (iii) determine whether the lease is an operating or financing lease; and (iv) recognize lease Right of Use ( ROU\u201d) assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The corresponding ROU asset is measured from the initial lease liability, adjusted by (i) accrued or prepaid rents; (ii) remaining unamortized initial direct costs and lease incentives; and (iii) any impairments of the ROU asset. The interest rate implicit in our lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, which represents an internally developed rate that would be incurred to borrow, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nRevenue Recognition\nBeginning in 2017, we began to generate revenue from (i) non-refundable upfront fees, milestone payments and royalties earned under license agreements and (ii) providing research and development services.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the full retrospective adoption method and established our revenue recognition accounting policy pursuant to this new standard. See Note 1-Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 5-Revenue Recognition\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information and accounting considerations related to revenue recognition, including revenue recognition pertaining to licensing arrangements.\nLicensing Arrangements\nWe entered into the Sato Agreement in the first quarter of 2017, and the Sato Amendment in October 2018, and may enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, in exchange for non-refundable upfront payments and potential future milestone and royalty payments.\nIf the license of our Company's intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the estimated performance period and the appropriate method of measuring progress during the performance period for purposes of recognizing revenue. We re-evaluate the estimated performance period and measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust related revenue recognition accordingly.\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license and collaboration revenue and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nAmounts received prior to satisfying all revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets.\nSpecifically related to the Sato Agreement, as amended, we recognize revenue using a time-based input method that results in straight-line recognition over the Company's performance period. We monitor and reassess the estimated performance period for purposes of revenue recognition during each reporting period. We expect to reassess the estimated performance period during the first quarter of 2020, as we consider how the combined SB204 and SB206 development program timeline in Japan may potentially be affected by various factors, including (i) the recent results from our SB206 Phase 3 trials in the U.S., including but not limited to top-line efficacy results announced in January 2020, (ii) our plans and timelines for potential further clinical development of SB206 in the U.S., which is subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020, and (iii) our in-house drug manufacturing capabilities and the progression of our manufacturing technology transfer projects with third-party contract manufacturing organizations. Therefore, if the duration of the combined SB204 and SB206 development program timeline is affected by the establishment or subsequent adjustments to a mutually agreed upon SB204 and SB206 development plan in the Japan territory, we will adjust its estimated performance period for revenue recognition purposes accordingly, as needed.\nGovernment research contracts and grants revenue.\nUnder the terms of the contracts and grants awarded, we are entitled to receive reimbursement of our allowable direct expenses, allocated overhead, general and administrative expenses and payment of other specified amounts. Revenues from development and support activities under government research contracts and grants are recorded in the period in which the related costs are incurred. Associated expenses are recognized when incurred as research and development expense. Revenue recognized in excess of amounts collected are recorded as contracts and grants receivable. Any of the funding sources may, at their discretion, request reimbursement for expenses or return of funds, or both, as a result of noncompliance by us with the terms of the grants. No reimbursement of expenses or return of funds has been requested or made since inception of the contracts and grants. See Note 5-Revenue Recognition\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding government grants.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAccrued Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees incurred by CROs in connection with clinical trials, fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials, professional service fees and unpaid salaries, wages and benefits.\nWe accrue our expenses related to clinical trials based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. We do not anticipate the future settlement of existing accruals to differ materially from our estimates.\nReedy Creek Purchase Agreement\nWe have determined that the Reedy Creek Purchase Agreement is within the scope of ASC 730-20, Research and Development Arrangements. We concluded that there has not been a substantive and genuine transfer of risk related to the Purchase Agreement as (i) Reedy Creek has the opportunity to recover its investment regardless of the outcome of the research and development programs within the scope of the agreement (prior to commercialization of any in scope assets through potential out-licensing agreements and related potential future milestone payments); and (ii) there is a presumption that we are obligated to pay Reedy Creek amounts equal to its investment based on the related party relationship at the time the parties entered into the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement is a broad funding arrangement, due to (i) the multi-asset, or portfolio approach including three developmental assets that are within the scope of the arrangement; and (ii) Reedy Creek's approximate 15% ownership of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nAs such, we have determined that the appropriate accounting treatment under ASC 730-20 is to record the initial proceeds of $25,000 as cash and cash equivalents, as we have the ability to direct the usage of funds, and a long-term liability within our classified balance sheet. The long-term liability will remain until we receive future milestones from other potential third parties, as defined within the Purchase Agreement, of which 25% will be contractually owed to Reedy Creek. If potential future milestones are received by us, and become partly due to Reedy Creek, the corresponding partial repayment to Reedy Creek will result in a ratable reduction of the total long-term obligation to repay the initial purchase price.\nLigand Funding Agreement\nWe have determined that the Ligand transaction is within the scope of ASC 730-20 as it represents an obligation to perform contractual services for the development of SB206 using commercially reasonable efforts. In addition, the Funding Agreement also states that if all development of SB206 is ceased prior to the first regulatory approval, we must pay to Ligand an amount equal to the purchase price less the amount spent in accordance with the development budget on development activities conducted prior to such cessation. As such, we concluded that the appropriate accounting treatment under ASC 730-20 was to record the initial proceeds of $12,000, as a liability and as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet, as the funds could only be used for the progression of SB206.\nWe amortize the liability ratably during each reporting period, based on the Ligand funding as a percentage of the total direct costs we incur during the reporting period related to the estimated total cost to progress the SB206 program to a regulatory approval in the U.S. The ratable Ligand funding is presented within the consolidated statement of operations as an offset to research and development expenses associated with the SB206 program. During the first quarter of 2020, we expect to reassess the estimated total cost to progress the SB206 program to a U.S. regulatory approval, as we consider how such estimated costs may potentially be affected by various factors, including (i) the recent results from our SB206 Phase 3 trials in the U.S., including but not limited to top-line efficacy results announced in January 2020, (ii) our plans and timelines for potential further clinical development of SB206 in the U.S., which is subject to additional funding and FDA feedback from the Type C meeting with the FDA on April 1, 2020, and (iii) our in-house drug manufacturing capabilities and the progression of our manufacturing technology transfer projects with third-party contract manufacturing organizations.\nThe initial restricted cash balance was also reduced ratably during interim reporting periods in 2019 in a manner consistent with the amortization method for the Ligand funding liability balance. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate amount spent in accordance with the SB206 development budget on SB206 development activities had exceeded the $12,000 purchase price, causing the aforementioned repayment provision provided for in the Funding Agreement to no longer be enforceable. Therefore, we reported no restricted cash balance related to the Funding Agreement, as of December 31, 2019 in our consolidated balance sheet.\nFair Value Measurements\nWarrant Liability\nOn January 9, 2018, we issued warrants to purchase 10,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.66, which expire four years from the date of issuance. The warrants include certain provisions that provide the warrant holder with the optional right to settle any unexercised warrants for cash in the event of a fundamental transaction, as defined in the warrant agreement and associated form of warrant. Due to this provision, the warrants are recorded as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet at the estimated fair value on the date of issuance and are re-valued as of each subsequent reporting period with adjustments to the fair value recognized as an unrealized gain or loss within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe fair value of the warrants is estimated using a valuation model that approximates a Monte Carlo simulation model, which takes into consideration the probability of a fundamental transaction occurring during the contractual term of the warrants. The valuation model includes estimates and assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, fair value of our underlying common stock, expected life of the warrants, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. Our estimates underlying the assumptions used in the valuation model are subject to risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Such changes could have a significant effect on our reported net losses in future periods.\nThe probability of a fundamental transaction occurring during the remaining contractual term of the warrants is based on our judgment and takes into consideration the risk-adjusted probability of success within our drug development programs. An increase in the probability of occurrence of a fundamental transaction may increase the fair value of the warrants. Expected stock price volatility is based on the actual historical volatility of a group of comparable publicly traded companies observed over a historical period equal to the expected remaining life of the warrant. The fair value of the underlying common stock is the published closing market price on the Nasdaq Global Market as of each reporting date, as adjusted for significant events, as necessary. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of valuation equal to the remaining expected life of the warrants. An increase in the expected stock price volatility, fair value of the underlying common stock or risk-free interest rate will increase the fair value of the warrants. The dividend yield percentage is zero because we do not currently pay dividends nor do we intend to do so during the expected term of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. All other assumptions held constant, the fair value of the warrants will decrease as the remaining contractual term decreases.\nSee Note 10-Warrants\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the warrants and see Note 1-Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our accounting policy pertaining to the fair value of financial instruments.\nShare-Based Compensation\nDetermination of the Fair Value of Stock-based Compensation Grants\nWe record the fair value of stock options, and other stock-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees as of the grant date as stock-based compensation expense. We typically recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. We recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense for employee and nonemployee stock option grants of $1.8 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of assumptions, some of which are highly subjective, including (i) the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant, (ii) the expected volatility of our stock, (iii) the expected term of the award, (iv) the risk-free interest rate and (v) expected dividends. In applying these assumptions, we considered the following factors:\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Due to the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. We\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nalso considered characteristics such as industry, stage of life cycle, financial leverage, enterprise value, risk profiles and position within the industry, along with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We have estimated the expected term of our employee stock options using the simplified\u201d method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of granted stock-based awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> See Note 11-Share-Based Compensation\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for awards granted in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and to revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.\nTangible Stockholder Return Plan, or Performance Plan\nOn August 2, 2018, our board of directors approved and established the Tangible Stockholder Return Plan, which is a performance-based long-term incentive plan. The Performance Plan is tiered, with two separate tranches, each of which has a distinct share price target (measured as the average publicly traded share price of our common stock on the Nasdaq stock exchange for a 30 consecutive trading day period) that will, if achieved, trigger a distinct fixed bonus pool. The share price target for the first tranche and related bonus pool are $11.17 per share and $25.0 million, respectively. The share price target for the second tranche and related bonus pool are $25.45 per share and $50.0 million, respectively.\nWe have concluded that the Performance Plan is within the scope of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation as the underlying plan obligations are based on the potential attainment of certain market share price targets of our common stock. Any awards under the Performance Plan would be payable, at the discretion of our compensation committee following the achievement of the applicable share price target, in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, provided that, prior to any payment in common stock, our stockholders have approved the reservation of shares of our common stock for such payment.\nASC 718 requires that a liability-based award should be classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and the amount of compensation cost recognized should be based on the fair value of the liability. When a liability-based award includes both a service and market condition, the market condition is taken into account when determining the appropriate method to estimate fair value and the compensation cost is amortized over the estimated service period. Therefore, the liability associated with the Performance Plan obligation is recorded within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at the estimated fair value on the date of issuance and is re-valued each subsequent reporting period end with adjustments to the fair value recognized as share-based compensation expense within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of obligations under the Performance Plan are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. Our common stock price is simulated under the Geometric Brownian Motion framework under each simulation path. The other assumptions for the Monte Carlo simulation include the risk-free interest rate, estimated volatility and the expected term. Expected stock price volatility is based on the actual historical volatility of a group of comparable publicly traded companies observed over a historical period equal to the expected remaining life of the plan. The fair value of the underlying common stock is the published closing market price on the Nasdaq Global Market as of each reporting date, as adjusted for significant events, as necessary. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of valuation equal to the remaining expected life of the plan. The dividend yield percentage is zero because we do not currently pay dividends, nor do we intend to do so during the expected term of the plan. The expected life of bonus awards under the Performance Plan is\nassumed to be equivalent to the remaining contractual term based on the estimated service period including the service inception date of the plan participants and the contractual end of the Performance Plan.\nOur estimates underlying the assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model are subject to risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Such changes could have a significant effect on our reported net losses in future periods. See Note 12-Tangible Stockholder Return Plan\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the Performance Plan and see Note 1-Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our accounting policy pertaining to the fair value of financial instruments.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nSARs that include cash settlement features are accounted for as liability-based awards pursuant to ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation. The fair value of such SARs is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model on each financial reporting date using expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life and fair value per share assumptions.\nThe fair value of each liability award is estimated with a valuation model that uses certain assumptions, such as the award date, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life of the award and fair value per share assumptions. Due to limited historical data, we estimate stock price volatility based on the actual volatility of comparable publicly traded companies over the expected term. In evaluating similarity, we considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, financial leverage, size and risk profile. The expected term for liability-based awards is the estimated contractual life. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve during the expected life of the award. See Note 11-Share-Based Compensation\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of SARs.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of a biotechnology company.

These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks including, but not limited to, those set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical development-stage biotechnology company focused on leveraging nitric oxide's naturally occurring anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action to treat a range of diseases with significant unmet needs. Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the natural immune system response against microbial pathogens and is a critical regulator of inflammation. Our ability to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action has enabled us to create a platform with the potential to generate differentiated product candidates.\nThe two key components of our nitric oxide platform are our proprietary Nitricil technology, which drives the creation of new chemical entities, or NCEs, and our formulation science, both of which we use to tune our product candidates for specific indications. Our ability to deploy nitric oxide in a solid form, on demand and in localized formulations allows us the potential to improve patient outcomes in a variety of diseases.\nWe have advanced strategic development programs in the field of dermatology, while also further expanding the platform into women's health and gastroenterological, or GI, therapeutic areas. We have clinical-stage dermatology drug candidates with multi-factorial (SB204), anti-viral (SB206), anti-fungal (SB208) and anti-inflammatory (SB414) mechanisms of action. We have recently introduced SB207 as a possible product candidate for additional anti-viral programs. During 2019, our clinical-stage development efforts were focused on our molluscum contagiosum (SB206) and atopic dermatitis (SB414) programs. We also conducted preclinical work on NCEs and formulations for the treatment of human papilloma virus, or HPV, related illnesses in the women's health field (WH504 and WH602) and inflammatory diseases in the GI field. During 2020, we intend to focus our clinical-stage development efforts on our molluscum contagiosum (SB206) program, subject to available capital and regulatory feedback. All other clinical-stage programs are currently on hold. Further advancement of the molluscum contagiosum (SB206) program, or any other program across our platform, is dependent upon our ability to access additional capital. Additional capital may potentially include (i) non-dilutive sources, such as partnerships, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships; or (ii) equity or debt financings. Any issuance of equity or debt that could be convertible into equity would result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. We intend to pursue financing which may be dilutive, non-dilutive or both, in the near future. We intend to utilize one or more financial advisors to assist in the pursuit of optimal capital sourcing pathways, including those that are strategic in nature and center around our late-stage assets, and the broader dermatology platform and underlying Nitricil technology, as well as exploring other potential sources of financing and strategic alternatives.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a total cash and cash equivalents balance of $13.7 million and positive working capital of $2.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our planned operating needs into the early part of the second quarter of 2020. This projected cash runway excludes (i) potential costs associated with an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial, which is subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020, and (ii) any proceeds received subsequent to January 31, 2020 from potential future sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, described below, if available.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs, as described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. Therefore, we will need to secure additional capital or financing and/or delay, defer, or reduce our cash expenditures by the early part of the second quarter of 2020, including those associated with our product development programs, or we may need to dissolve and liquidate our assets or seek protection under bankruptcy laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or financing on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all. If we are forced to terminate or eliminate our product development programs,\nwind down our operations, liquidate or seek bankruptcy protection, it is unclear to what extent we will be able to pay our obligations, and, accordingly, it is further unclear whether and to what extent any resources would be available for distributions to our stockholders. Alternatively, we may seek to engage in one or more potential transactions, such as the sale of the Company, or sale or divestiture of some of our assets, such as a sale of our dermatology platform assets, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such a transaction or transactions on a timely basis or at all or on terms that are favorable to us.\nAs described below in Business Updates,\u201d in August 2019 we entered into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor, Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase shares of our common stock at our request from time to time during the 30-month term of the agreement.\nAs also described below in Business Updates,\u201d in late April 2019 and early May 2019 we entered into (i) a royalty and milestone payments purchase agreement with a stockholder that provided $25.0 million of immediate funding; and (ii) a development funding and royalties agreement with a corporate partner that provided $12.0 million of immediate funding.\nWe will need additional funding to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs. Please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion of our current liquidity and our future funding needs.\nDuring 2019, our primary programmatic focus was on our molluscum contagiosum (SB206) and atopic dermatitis (SB414) programs.\nWe conducted and completed our SB206 Phase 2 trial for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in December 2018 and in early March 2019, completed an end-of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and received written minutes. During the second quarter of 2019, we commenced the Phase 3 pivotal development program for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Patient recruitment for the Phase 3 trials was completed in August 2019. Top-line efficacy results from the Phase 3 trials were announced in January 2020. SB206 did not achieve statistically significant results in the primary endpoint in both trials, which was the complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. Based on the results of the Phase 3 pivotal trials described below in Key Clinical Stage Product Candidate Development Updates,\u201d we target commencing an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2020, subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020. Execution of remaining Phase 3 pivotal development program activities continues into 2020 with receipt of pivotal trial safety data in the first quarter of 2020 and completion of ancillary trials targeted prior to or during the second quarter of 2020.\nFollowing the completion of two complementary Phase 1b clinical trials with SB414 in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis in 2018, we conducted non-clinical studies with SB414 for atopic dermatitis and completed our Phase 2 clinical development plan during 2019 to support a potential future Phase 2 clinical program launch. The SB414 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nKey Clinical Stage Product Candidate Development Updates\nSB206, a Topical Anti-viral Treatment for Viral Skin Infections\nWe are developing SB206 as a topical anti-viral gel for the treatment of viral skin infections, with a current focus on molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum is a contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus. Molluscum affects up to six million people in the U.S. annually. The greatest incidence is in children aged one to 14 years. The average time to resolution is 13 months, however, 13% of children experience lesions that may not resolve in 24 months. There is no FDA-approved treatment for molluscum. More than half of patients diagnosed with the infection are untreated. The majority of patients that receive treatment are treated with painful procedures and the remaining are often prescribed products indicated for the treatment of external genital warts.\nWe believed that observational learnings from an in-licensed topical nitric oxide technology study showing clinically meaningful complete clearance rates of baseline molluscum lesions, combined with our SB206 program knowledge, provided a logical pathway for SB206 development in the molluscum indication. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA in December 2017 and initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial utilizing SB206 for the treatment of molluscum in the first quarter of 2018. The Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, ascending dose clinical trial evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SB206 in 256 patients, ages 2 and above, with molluscum. Patients were treated with one of three concentrations of SB206 or vehicle for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. We announced top-line results from this Phase 2\nclinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. SB206 demonstrated statistically significant results in the clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12, with signs of efficacy evident as early as Week 2 with the 12% once-daily dose. The safety and tolerability profiles were favorable overall with no serious adverse events reported, including the most effective dose, SB206 12% once-daily.\nWith the full results from this Phase 2 trial made available, we held an end-of-Phase 2 (Type B) meeting with the FDA in early March 2019. Based on this meeting and the written minutes received, we commenced the Phase 3 development program for molluscum, primarily comprised of two pivotal clinical trials, in the second quarter of 2019 with SB206 12% once-daily as the active treatment arm. The B-SIMPLE\u201d (Berdazimer Sodium In Molluscum Patients with Lesions) Phase 3 pivotal trials consisted of two (B-SIMPLE1 and B-SIMPLE2) multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SB206 12% once-daily in approximately 680 patients (2:1 active:vehicle randomization), ages 6 months and above, with molluscum. Patients were treated once-daily with SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel once daily for a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks to all treatable lesions (baseline and new). There were visits at Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and a safety follow-up at Week 24. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. Both Phase 3 pivotal trials began dosing patients in June 2019 and we completed patient recruitment in August 2019. Top-line efficacy results from the Phase 3 trials were announced in January 2020.\nSB206 did not achieve statistically significant results in the primary endpoint in both trials, which was the complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. In B-SIMPLE2, SB206 was near statistical significance for the primary endpoint (p=0.062), and was statistically significant for the secondary endpoint, the complete clearance of all lesions at Week 8 (p=0.028), and all other pre-specified sensitivity analyses. We believe this confirms the robustness of the data in the B-SIMPLE2 trial. While the B-SIMPLE1 trial was not statistically significant for the primary endpoint (p=0.375) nor the secondary endpoint (p=0.202), all other pre-specified analyses trended in the same direction of improved treatment effect as the B-SIMPLE2 results.\nIn addition, the results of a statistical test of heterogeneity support that the two pivotal trials are not different from each other. Across both studies, the primary analysis odds ratio and standard error point estimates were similar and in a consistent direction with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These statistical results are supported by an integrated analysis of the two pivotal trials, which demonstrated statistically significant complete clearance rates at Week 12 for SB206 (p=0.049). These additional analyses do not change the outcome of either B-SIMPLE trial, and the FDA may disagree with our conclusions from these analyses. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of less than 0.050 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance.\nThe last subject completed their final visit as part of the ongoing safety evaluation through Week 24 in February 2020 and full efficacy and safety data, including data from the safety evaluation through Week 24, are targeted to be available in March 2020.\nBased on the results of the Phase 3 pivotal trials, discussed above, we target commencing an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2020, subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020.\nExecution of remaining Phase 3 pivotal development program activities for SB206 in molluscum continues into 2020 with receipt of pivotal trial safety data in the first quarter of 2020 and the completion of ancillary trials targeted prior to or during the second quarter of 2020.\nSB414, a Topical Cream for the Treatment of Inflammatory Skin Diseases\nIn 2018, we completed two complementary Phase 1b clinical trials with SB414 in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The design of these complementary trials was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SB414. The trials were also designed to assess overall and specific target engagement through a reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers, also known as pharmacodynamic assessment.\nAtopic Dermatitis\nWe initiated a Phase 1b trial with SB414 in adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in December 2017. In the Phase 1b trial, 48 adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis with up to 30% body surface area at baseline, were randomized to receive one of 2% SB414 cream, 6% SB414 cream, or vehicle, twice daily for two weeks. In the complementary Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks.\nWe received and analyzed the preliminary top line results from the Phase 1b clinical trials during the second and third quarters of 2018. In the atopic dermatitis trial, biomarkers from the Th2, Th17 and Th22 inflammatory pathways known to be highly relevant and indicative of atopic dermatitis, including Interleukin-13, or IL-13, IL-4R, IL-5, IL-17A and IL-22, were downregulated after two weeks of treatment with SB414 2%. The changes in Th2 and Th22 biomarkers and clinical efficacy assessed as the percent change in Eczema Area Severity Index scores were highly correlated in the SB414 2% group. Additionally, the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 3-point improvement on the pruritus (itch) numeric rating scale after two weeks of treatment was greater for patients treated with SB414 2% compared to patients treated with vehicle.\nThe 2% or 6% doses of SB414 in the trial did not result in any serious adverse events, and SB414 2% was more tolerable with no patients discontinuing treatment in the trial due to application site reactions. SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. Additionally, SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours, in both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. Given the successful downregulation of key biomarkers, favorable tolerability and lack of systemic exposure with SB414 2%, we conducted non-clinical studies and completed our Phase 2 clinical development plan during 2019 to support a potential future Phase 2 clinical program launch. The SB414 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nPsoriasis\nWe initiated clinical development of SB414, our first use of our nitric oxide platform in the field of immunology by dosing the first patient in October 2017 in a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate SB414 in a cream for the treatment of psoriasis. Earlier in 2017, we presented mechanistic evidence for SB414, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in composite psoriasis scores and an inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F in an animal model.\nIn the Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks. We received and analyzed the preliminary top line results from this Phase 1b clinical trial during the second and third quarters of 2018. SB414 at the 6% dose did not result in any serious adverse events, but SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across the trial. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. Additionally, SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours. Based on the results of the Phase 1b trial in psoriasis, we will potentially explore the use of lower doses of SB414 in psoriasis, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nSB204, for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we conducted a Type C meeting to further discuss the path forward for our SB204 candidate and possible Phase 3 programs for the treatment of acne vulgaris with the FDA, and the potential for proceeding with a more narrowly defined patient segmentation. In that meeting, our focus was centered specifically on the severe patient population. In the third quarter of 2018, the FDA provided feedback in their minutes on two paths forward for the acne indication, confirming the need for one additional pivotal trial for moderate-to-severe acne patients prior to a NDA submission or, as an alternative, additional preliminary trials for a severe-only patient population.\nFollowing receipt of FDA feedback via written minutes, we have determined that the most pragmatic development pathway for us will be to conduct one additional pivotal Phase 3 trial in moderate-to-severe acne patients. We have completed our clinical development plan for this additional trial, and further advancement of this program is subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nKey Preclinical Stage Product Candidate Development Updates\nExpansion of Nitric Oxide Platform\nIn December 2019, we received written responses in response to a pre-IND meeting request with the FDA for a new anti-viral product candidate, SB207. We have identified targeted viral opportunities of high unmet need where we believe our nitric oxide releasing technology could provide clinical benefit to patients. The SB207 product incorporates our existing drug substance, berdazimer sodium (NVN1000), with a new formulation specifically engineered for a number of anti-viral programs.\nAdvancement in Women's Health\nIn August 2019, we received a Phase 1 Federal grant of approximately $0.2 million from the National Institutes of Health. The funds are to be used to advance formulation development of a nitric oxide-containing intravaginal gel (WH602) designed to treat high-risk HPV infections that can lead to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or CIN. The specific focus is to ensure the nitric oxide delivery from the gel replicates doses of nitric oxide previously demonstrated to be effective against HPV in our clinical and in vitro studies.\nIn February 2020, following the successful progression of Phase 1, we were awarded a Phase 2 federal grant of approximately $1.0 million from the NIH that will enable the conduct of IND-enabling toxicology and pharmacology studies and other preclinical activity with respect to WH602. We may be eligible to receive an additional $0.5 million in funding as part of this Phase 2 grant, subject to availability of NIH funds and satisfactory progress of the project during the initial 12-month term.\nIn September 2019, we received a Federal grant from the U.S. Department of Defense's, or DoD, Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, or CDMRP, of approximately $1.1 million as part of its Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program. The grant will support the development of a non-gel formulation product candidate (WH504) designed to treat high-risk HPV infections that can lead to CIN, with well-characterized physical chemical properties suitable for intravaginal administration. In addition, the grant will support the evaluation of the effect of varying concentrations and treatment durations of berdazimer sodium (NVN1000) against HPV-18 in human raft cell culture in vitro studies. This targeted research aims to create a disease-altering treatment that could be used upon detection and the early signs of high-risk HPV infection to intervene before progression to cervical cancer.\nUnder the terms of the aforementioned NIH and DoD grants, we are entitled to receive the grant funds in the form of periodic reimbursements of our allowable direct expenses, allocated overhead, general and administrative expenses and payment of other specified amounts.\nThese product candidates currently in development together represent the core of our Women's Health business unit. This unit has continued to be supported through a collaboration with Health Decisions, Inc., or Health Decisions.\nAddition of Gastrointestinal Disease as a Therapeutic Focus\nIn January 2019, we announced the addition of GI diseases as a therapeutic focus area as part of our overall science and business strategy. This decision is based on the connection between the multi-factorial pathologies of GI diseases and the demonstrable anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of Novan's nitric oxide technology. Nitric oxide produced in the GI tract regulates many of its functions including the secretion of mucous for protection against physical, chemical, and microbial injury, perfusion of blood through the GI tissue, mitigation of white blood cell adherence to GI tissue to protect from injury and the healing and repair of ulcers. We believe that our initial expansion into GI will require minimal investment due to our ability to leverage current technology, experience and assets.\nBusiness Updates\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement with Aspire Capital\nOn August 30, 2019, we entered into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock at our request from time to time during the 30-month term of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. The aggregate amount that we may raise through sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement is subject to certain limitations including, but not limited to: (i) the number of shares that may be sold will be limited to 5,211,339 shares, representing 19.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock on August 30, 2019, if the average price paid for all shares issued under the agreement is less than $2.17; and (ii) on any purchase date, the closing sale price of our common stock must be greater than or equal to $0.25. As of December 31, 2019, we had sold an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $2.49 per share under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. As of January 31, 2020, we had sold an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $1.19 per share under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. These amounts, combined with the 345,622 shares issued as part of the commitment fee related to the agreement's execution, leads to a total of 1,345,622 shares issued to Aspire Capital under the agreement as of January 31, 2020.\nConcurrently with entering into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with Aspire Capital, or the Registration Rights Agreement, in which we agreed to file one or more registration statements, as permissible and necessary to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, registering the sale of the shares of our common stock that have been and may be issued to Aspire Capital under the Aspire\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreement. On September 16, 2019, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, a prospectus to our effective Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-233632) registering 7,032,630 shares of common stock that have been and may be offered to Aspire Capital from time to time under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement.\nThere are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, and we will control the timing and amount of sales of our common stock to Aspire Capital. Aspire Capital has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as we may direct in accordance with the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future financing transactions, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. In consideration for entering into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we issued to Aspire Capital 345,622 shares of our common stock as part of the commitment fee. The Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us any time, at our discretion, without any penalty or additional cost to us. Any proceeds we receive under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nPlease refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.\nRoyalty and Milestone Payments Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek Investments LLC\nOn April 29, 2019, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek, pursuant to which Reedy Creek provided us funding in an initial amount of $25.0 million, which we will use primarily to pursue the development, regulatory approval and commercialization (including through out-license agreements and other third-party arrangements) activities for SB206, for the treatment of molluscum, and advancing programmatically other activities with respect to SB414, for atopic dermatitis, and SB204, for acne. Reedy Creek was to provide $10.0 million of additional funding contingent upon our achievement of SB206 clinical trial success, defined as (i) the achievement, no later than March 31, 2020, of statistically significant rates of complete clearance of lesions for molluscum contagiosum in humans at week 12 in each of the two Phase 3 clinical trials or any other primary endpoint required or accepted by the FDA for the SB206 product; or (ii) equivalent achievement (as agreed upon by the parties). Based on the top line efficacy results from the Phase 3 SB206 program released in January 2020, we understand that Reedy Creek will not be paying us the contingent $10.0 million of additional funding.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will pay Reedy Creek ongoing quarterly payments, calculated based on an applicable percentage per product of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments received by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for SB204, SB206 and SB414 in the United States, Mexico or Canada, net of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments paid by us to third parties pursuant to any agreements under which we have in-licensed intellectual property with respect to such products.\nThe applicable percentage used for determining the ongoing quarterly payments, applied to amounts received directly by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for each product, ranges from 10% for SB206 to 20% for SB414 and SB204. However, the agreement provides that the applicable percentage for each product will be 25% for fees or milestone payments received by us (but not royalty payments received by us) until Reedy Creek has received payments under the Purchase Agreement equal to the total funding amount provided by Reedy Creek under the Purchase Agreement. If we decide to commercialize SB204, SB206 or SB414 on our own following regulatory approval, as opposed to commercializing through an out-license agreement or other third-party arrangement, we will be obligated to pay Reedy Creek a low single digits royalty on net sales of such products.\nDevelopment Funding and Royalties Agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\nOn May 4, 2019, we entered into the Funding Agreement, with Ligand, pursuant to which Ligand provided us funding of $12.0 million, which we used to pursue the development and regulatory approval of SB206, for the treatment of molluscum.\nPursuant to the Funding Agreement, we will pay Ligand up to $20.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement by us of certain regulatory and commercial milestones associated with SB206 or any product that incorporates or uses NVN1000, the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our clinical stage product candidates, for the treatment of molluscum. In addition to the milestone payments, we will pay Ligand tiered royalties ranging from 7% to 10% based on annual aggregate net sales of such products in the United States, Mexico or Canada.\nDrug Substance and Drug Product Agreements\nOn October 15, 2018, we established a strategic alliance with Orion, a Finnish full-scale pharmaceutical company with broad experience in drug manufacturing. The alliance enables Orion to manufacture our topical nitric oxide-releasing product candidates on our behalf and on the behalf of our global strategic partners. We", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the natural immune system response against microbial pathogens and is a critical regulator of inflammation. Our ability to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action has enabled us to create a platform with the potential to generate differentiated product candidates.\nThe two key components of our nitric oxide platform are our proprietary Nitricil technology, which drives the creation of new chemical entities, or NCEs, and our formulation science, both of which we use to tune our product candidates for specific indications. Our ability to deploy nitric oxide in a solid form, on demand and in localized formulations allows us the potential to improve patient outcomes in a variety of diseases.\nWe have advanced strategic development programs in the field of dermatology, while also further expanding the platform into women's health and gastroenterological, or GI, therapeutic areas. We have clinical-stage dermatology drug candidates with multi-factorial (SB204), anti-viral (SB206), anti-fungal (SB208) and anti-inflammatory (SB414) mechanisms of action. We have recently introduced SB207 as a possible product candidate for additional anti-viral programs. During 2019, our clinical-stage development efforts were focused on our molluscum contagiosum (SB206) and atopic dermatitis (SB414) programs. We also conducted preclinical work on NCEs and formulations for the treatment of human papilloma virus, or HPV, related illnesses in the women's health field (WH504 and WH602) and inflammatory diseases in the GI field. During 2020, we intend to focus our clinical-stage development efforts on our molluscum contagiosum (SB206) program, subject to available capital and regulatory feedback. All other clinical-stage programs are currently on hold. Further advancement of the molluscum contagiosum (SB206) program, or any other program across our platform, is dependent upon our ability to access additional capital. Additional capital may potentially include (i) non-dilutive sources, such as partnerships, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships; or (ii) equity or debt financings. Any issuance of equity or debt that could be convertible into equity would result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. We intend to pursue financing which may be dilutive, non-dilutive or both, in the near future. We intend to utilize one or more financial advisors to assist in the pursuit of optimal capital sourcing pathways, including those that are strategic in nature and center around our late-stage assets, and the broader dermatology platform and underlying Nitricil technology, as well as exploring other potential sources of financing and strategic alternatives.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a total cash and cash equivalents balance of $13.7 million and positive working capital of $2.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance will provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our planned operating needs into the early part of the second quarter of 2020. This projected cash runway excludes (i) potential costs associated with an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial, which is subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020, and (ii) any proceeds received subsequent to January 31, 2020 from potential future sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, described below, if available.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs, as described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. Therefore, we will need to secure additional capital or financing and/or delay, defer, or reduce our cash expenditures by the early part of the second quarter of 2020, including those associated with our product development programs, or we may need to dissolve and liquidate our assets or seek protection under bankruptcy laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or financing on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all. If we are forced to terminate or eliminate our product development programs,\nwind down our operations, liquidate or seek bankruptcy protection, it is unclear to what extent we will be able to pay our obligations, and, accordingly, it is further unclear whether and to what extent any resources would be available for distributions to our stockholders. Alternatively, we may seek to engage in one or more potential transactions, such as the sale of the Company, or sale or divestiture of some of our assets, such as a sale of our dermatology platform assets, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such a transaction or transactions on a timely basis or at all or on terms that are favorable to us.\nAs described below in Business Updates,\u201d in August 2019 we entered into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor, Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase shares of our common stock at our request from time to time during the 30-month term of the agreement.\nAs also described below in Business Updates,\u201d in late April 2019 and early May 2019 we entered into (i) a royalty and milestone payments purchase agreement with a stockholder that provided $25.0 million of immediate funding; and (ii) a development funding and royalties agreement with a corporate partner that provided $12.0 million of immediate funding.\nWe will need additional funding to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs. Please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion of our current liquidity and our future funding needs.\nDuring 2019, our primary programmatic focus was on our molluscum contagiosum (SB206) and atopic dermatitis (SB414) programs.\nWe conducted and completed our SB206 Phase 2 trial for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in December 2018 and in early March 2019, completed an end-of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and received written minutes. During the second quarter of 2019, we commenced the Phase 3 pivotal development program for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Patient recruitment for the Phase 3 trials was completed in August 2019. Top-line efficacy results from the Phase 3 trials were announced in January 2020. SB206 did not achieve statistically significant results in the primary endpoint in both trials, which was the complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. Based on the results of the Phase 3 pivotal trials described below in Key Clinical Stage Product Candidate Development Updates,\u201d we target commencing an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2020, subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020. Execution of remaining Phase 3 pivotal development program activities continues into 2020 with receipt of pivotal trial safety data in the first quarter of 2020 and completion of ancillary trials targeted prior to or during the second quarter of 2020.\nFollowing the completion of two complementary Phase 1b clinical trials with SB414 in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis in 2018, we conducted non-clinical studies with SB414 for atopic dermatitis and completed our Phase 2 clinical development plan during 2019 to support a potential future Phase 2 clinical program launch. The SB414 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nKey Clinical Stage Product Candidate Development Updates\nSB206, a Topical Anti-viral Treatment for Viral Skin Infections\nWe are developing SB206 as a topical anti-viral gel for the treatment of viral skin infections, with a current focus on molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum is a contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus. Molluscum affects up to six million people in the U.S. annually. The greatest incidence is in children aged one to 14 years. The average time to resolution is 13 months, however, 13% of children experience lesions that may not resolve in 24 months. There is no FDA-approved treatment for molluscum. More than half of patients diagnosed with the infection are untreated. The majority of patients that receive treatment are treated with painful procedures and the remaining are often prescribed products indicated for the treatment of external genital warts.\nWe believed that observational learnings from an in-licensed topical nitric oxide technology study showing clinically meaningful complete clearance rates of baseline molluscum lesions, combined with our SB206 program knowledge, provided a logical pathway for SB206 development in the molluscum indication. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA in December 2017 and initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial utilizing SB206 for the treatment of molluscum in the first quarter of 2018. The Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, ascending dose clinical trial evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SB206 in 256 patients, ages 2 and above, with molluscum. Patients were treated with one of three concentrations of SB206 or vehicle for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. We announced top-line results from this Phase 2\nclinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. SB206 demonstrated statistically significant results in the clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12, with signs of efficacy evident as early as Week 2 with the 12% once-daily dose. The safety and tolerability profiles were favorable overall with no serious adverse events reported, including the most effective dose, SB206 12% once-daily.\nWith the full results from this Phase 2 trial made available, we held an end-of-Phase 2 (Type B) meeting with the FDA in early March 2019. Based on this meeting and the written minutes received, we commenced the Phase 3 development program for molluscum, primarily comprised of two pivotal clinical trials, in the second quarter of 2019 with SB206 12% once-daily as the active treatment arm. The B-SIMPLE\u201d (Berdazimer Sodium In Molluscum Patients with Lesions) Phase 3 pivotal trials consisted of two (B-SIMPLE1 and B-SIMPLE2) multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SB206 12% once-daily in approximately 680 patients (2:1 active:vehicle randomization), ages 6 months and above, with molluscum. Patients were treated once-daily with SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel once daily for a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks to all treatable lesions (baseline and new). There were visits at Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and a safety follow-up at Week 24. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. Both Phase 3 pivotal trials began dosing patients in June 2019 and we completed patient recruitment in August 2019. Top-line efficacy results from the Phase 3 trials were announced in January 2020.\nSB206 did not achieve statistically significant results in the primary endpoint in both trials, which was the complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. In B-SIMPLE2, SB206 was near statistical significance for the primary endpoint (p=0.062), and was statistically significant for the secondary endpoint, the complete clearance of all lesions at Week 8 (p=0.028), and all other pre-specified sensitivity analyses. We believe this confirms the robustness of the data in the B-SIMPLE2 trial. While the B-SIMPLE1 trial was not statistically significant for the primary endpoint (p=0.375) nor the secondary endpoint (p=0.202), all other pre-specified analyses trended in the same direction of improved treatment effect as the B-SIMPLE2 results.\nIn addition, the results of a statistical test of heterogeneity support that the two pivotal trials are not different from each other. Across both studies, the primary analysis odds ratio and standard error point estimates were similar and in a consistent direction with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These statistical results are supported by an integrated analysis of the two pivotal trials, which demonstrated statistically significant complete clearance rates at Week 12 for SB206 (p=0.049). These additional analyses do not change the outcome of either B-SIMPLE trial, and the FDA may disagree with our conclusions from these analyses. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of less than 0.050 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance.\nThe last subject completed their final visit as part of the ongoing safety evaluation through Week 24 in February 2020 and full efficacy and safety data, including data from the safety evaluation through Week 24, are targeted to be available in March 2020.\nBased on the results of the Phase 3 pivotal trials, discussed above, we target commencing an additional confirmatory Phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2020, subject to additional funding and feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA scheduled for April 1, 2020.\nExecution of remaining Phase 3 pivotal development program activities for SB206 in molluscum continues into 2020 with receipt of pivotal trial safety data in the first quarter of 2020 and the completion of ancillary trials targeted prior to or during the second quarter of 2020.\nSB414, a Topical Cream for the Treatment of Inflammatory Skin Diseases\nIn 2018, we completed two complementary Phase 1b clinical trials with SB414 in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The design of these complementary trials was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SB414. The trials were also designed to assess overall and specific target engagement through a reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers, also known as pharmacodynamic assessment.\nAtopic Dermatitis\nWe initiated a Phase 1b trial with SB414 in adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in December 2017. In the Phase 1b trial, 48 adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis with up to 30% body surface area at baseline, were randomized to receive one of 2% SB414 cream, 6% SB414 cream, or vehicle, twice daily for two weeks. In the complementary Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks.\nWe received and analyzed the preliminary top line results from the Phase 1b clinical trials during the second and third quarters of 2018. In the atopic dermatitis trial, biomarkers from the Th2, Th17 and Th22 inflammatory pathways known to be highly relevant and indicative of atopic dermatitis, including Interleukin-13, or IL-13, IL-4R, IL-5, IL-17A and IL-22, were downregulated after two weeks of treatment with SB414 2%. The changes in Th2 and Th22 biomarkers and clinical efficacy assessed as the percent change in Eczema Area Severity Index scores were highly correlated in the SB414 2% group. Additionally, the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 3-point improvement on the pruritus (itch) numeric rating scale after two weeks of treatment was greater for patients treated with SB414 2% compared to patients treated with vehicle.\nThe 2% or 6% doses of SB414 in the trial did not result in any serious adverse events, and SB414 2% was more tolerable with no patients discontinuing treatment in the trial due to application site reactions. SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. Additionally, SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours, in both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. Given the successful downregulation of key biomarkers, favorable tolerability and lack of systemic exposure with SB414 2%, we conducted non-clinical studies and completed our Phase 2 clinical development plan during 2019 to support a potential future Phase 2 clinical program launch. The SB414 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nPsoriasis\nWe initiated clinical development of SB414, our first use of our nitric oxide platform in the field of immunology by dosing the first patient in October 2017 in a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate SB414 in a cream for the treatment of psoriasis. Earlier in 2017, we presented mechanistic evidence for SB414, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in composite psoriasis scores and an inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F in an animal model.\nIn the Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks. We received and analyzed the preliminary top line results from this Phase 1b clinical trial during the second and third quarters of 2018. SB414 at the 6% dose did not result in any serious adverse events, but SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across the trial. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. Additionally, SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours. Based on the results of the Phase 1b trial in psoriasis, we will potentially explore the use of lower doses of SB414 in psoriasis, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nSB204, for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we conducted a Type C meeting to further discuss the path forward for our SB204 candidate and possible Phase 3 programs for the treatment of acne vulgaris with the FDA, and the potential for proceeding with a more narrowly defined patient segmentation. In that meeting, our focus was centered specifically on the severe patient population. In the third quarter of 2018, the FDA provided feedback in their minutes on two paths forward for the acne indication, confirming the need for one additional pivotal trial for moderate-to-severe acne patients prior to a NDA submission or, as an alternative, additional preliminary trials for a severe-only patient population.\nFollowing receipt of FDA feedback via written minutes, we have determined that the most pragmatic development pathway for us will be to conduct one additional pivotal Phase 3 trial in moderate-to-severe acne patients. We have completed our clinical development plan for this additional trial, and further advancement of this program is subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.\nKey Preclinical Stage Product Candidate Development Updates\nExpansion of Nitric Oxide Platform\nIn December 2019, we received written responses in response to a pre-IND meeting request with the FDA for a new anti-viral product candidate, SB207. We have identified targeted viral opportunities of high unmet need where we believe our nitric oxide releasing technology could provide clinical benefit to patients. The SB207 product incorporates our existing drug substance, berdazimer sodium (NVN1000), with a new formulation specifically engineered for a number of anti-viral programs.\nAdvancement in Women's Health\nIn August 2019, we received a Phase 1 Federal grant of approximately $0.2 million from the National Institutes of Health. The funds are to be used to advance formulation development of a nitric oxide-containing intravaginal gel (WH602) designed to treat high-risk HPV infections that can lead to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or CIN. The specific focus is to ensure the nitric oxide delivery from the gel replicates doses of nitric oxide previously demonstrated to be effective against HPV in our clinical and in vitro studies.\nIn February 2020, following the successful progression of Phase 1, we were awarded a Phase 2 federal grant of approximately $1.0 million from the NIH that will enable the conduct of IND-enabling toxicology and pharmacology studies and other preclinical activity with respect to WH602. We may be eligible to receive an additional $0.5 million in funding as part of this Phase 2 grant, subject to availability of NIH funds and satisfactory progress of the project during the initial 12-month term.\nIn September 2019, we received a Federal grant from the U.S. Department of Defense's, or DoD, Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, or CDMRP, of approximately $1.1 million as part of its Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program. The grant will support the development of a non-gel formulation product candidate (WH504) designed to treat high-risk HPV infections that can lead to CIN, with well-characterized physical chemical properties suitable for intravaginal administration. In addition, the grant will support the evaluation of the effect of varying concentrations and treatment durations of berdazimer sodium (NVN1000) against HPV-18 in human raft cell culture in vitro studies. This targeted research aims to create a disease-altering treatment that could be used upon detection and the early signs of high-risk HPV infection to intervene before progression to cervical cancer.\nUnder the terms of the aforementioned NIH and DoD grants, we are entitled to receive the grant funds in the form of periodic reimbursements of our allowable direct expenses, allocated overhead, general and administrative expenses and payment of other specified amounts.\nThese product candidates currently in development together represent the core of our Women's Health business unit. This unit has continued to be supported through a collaboration with Health Decisions, Inc., or Health Decisions.\nAddition of Gastrointestinal Disease as a Therapeutic Focus\nIn January 2019, we announced the addition of GI diseases as a therapeutic focus area as part of our overall science and business strategy. This decision is based on the connection between the multi-factorial pathologies of GI diseases and the demonstrable anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of Novan's nitric oxide technology. Nitric oxide produced in the GI tract regulates many of its functions including the secretion of mucous for protection against physical, chemical, and microbial injury, perfusion of blood through the GI tissue, mitigation of white blood cell adherence to GI tissue to protect from injury and the healing and repair of ulcers. We believe that our initial expansion into GI will require minimal investment due to our ability to leverage current technology, experience and assets.\nBusiness Updates\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement with Aspire Capital\nOn August 30, 2019, we entered into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock at our request from time to time during the 30-month term of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. The aggregate amount that we may raise through sales of common stock under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement is subject to certain limitations including, but not limited to: (i) the number of shares that may be sold will be limited to 5,211,339 shares, representing 19.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock on August 30, 2019, if the average price paid for all shares issued under the agreement is less than $2.17; and (ii) on any purchase date, the closing sale price of our common stock must be greater than or equal to $0.25. As of December 31, 2019, we had sold an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $2.49 per share under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. As of January 31, 2020, we had sold an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $1.19 per share under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. These amounts, combined with the 345,622 shares issued as part of the commitment fee related to the agreement's execution, leads to a total of 1,345,622 shares issued to Aspire Capital under the agreement as of January 31, 2020.\nConcurrently with entering into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with Aspire Capital, or the Registration Rights Agreement, in which we agreed to file one or more registration statements, as permissible and necessary to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, registering the sale of the shares of our common stock that have been and may be issued to Aspire Capital under the Aspire\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreement. On September 16, 2019, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, a prospectus to our effective Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-233632) registering 7,032,630 shares of common stock that have been and may be offered to Aspire Capital from time to time under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement.\nThere are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, and we will control the timing and amount of sales of our common stock to Aspire Capital. Aspire Capital has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as we may direct in accordance with the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future financing transactions, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement. In consideration for entering into the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we issued to Aspire Capital 345,622 shares of our common stock as part of the commitment fee. The Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us any time, at our discretion, without any penalty or additional cost to us. Any proceeds we receive under the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nPlease refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion of the Aspire Common Stock Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.\nRoyalty and Milestone Payments Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek Investments LLC\nOn April 29, 2019, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Reedy Creek, pursuant to which Reedy Creek provided us funding in an initial amount of $25.0 million, which we will use primarily to pursue the development, regulatory approval and commercialization (including through out-license agreements and other third-party arrangements) activities for SB206, for the treatment of molluscum, and advancing programmatically other activities with respect to SB414, for atopic dermatitis, and SB204, for acne. Reedy Creek was to provide $10.0 million of additional funding contingent upon our achievement of SB206 clinical trial success, defined as (i) the achievement, no later than March 31, 2020, of statistically significant rates of complete clearance of lesions for molluscum contagiosum in humans at week 12 in each of the two Phase 3 clinical trials or any other primary endpoint required or accepted by the FDA for the SB206 product; or (ii) equivalent achievement (as agreed upon by the parties). Based on the top line efficacy results from the Phase 3 SB206 program released in January 2020, we understand that Reedy Creek will not be paying us the contingent $10.0 million of additional funding.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will pay Reedy Creek ongoing quarterly payments, calculated based on an applicable percentage per product of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments received by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for SB204, SB206 and SB414 in the United States, Mexico or Canada, net of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments paid by us to third parties pursuant to any agreements under which we have in-licensed intellectual property with respect to such products.\nThe applicable percentage used for determining the ongoing quarterly payments, applied to amounts received directly by us pursuant to any out-license agreement for each product, ranges from 10% for SB206 to 20% for SB414 and SB204. However, the agreement provides that the applicable percentage for each product will be 25% for fees or milestone payments received by us (but not royalty payments received by us) until Reedy Creek has received payments under the Purchase Agreement equal to the total funding amount provided by Reedy Creek under the Purchase Agreement. If we decide to commercialize SB204, SB206 or SB414 on our own following regulatory approval, as opposed to commercializing through an out-license agreement or other third-party arrangement, we will be obligated to pay Reedy Creek a low single digits royalty on net sales of such products.\nDevelopment Funding and Royalties Agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\nOn May 4, 2019, we entered into the Funding Agreement, with Ligand, pursuant to which Ligand provided us funding of $12.0 million, which we used to pursue the development and regulatory approval of SB206, for the treatment of molluscum.\nPursuant to the Funding Agreement, we will pay Ligand up to $20.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement by us of certain regulatory and commercial milestones associated with SB206 or any product that incorporates or uses NVN1000, the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our clinical stage product candidates, for the treatment of molluscum. In addition to the milestone payments, we will pay Ligand tiered royalties ranging from 7% to 10% based on annual aggregate net sales of such products in the United States, Mexico or Canada.\nDrug Substance and Drug Product Agreements\nOn October 15, 2018, we established a strategic alliance with Orion, a Finnish full-scale pharmaceutical company with broad experience in drug manufacturing. The alliance enables Orion to manufacture our topical nitric oxide-releasing product candidates on our behalf and on the behalf of our global strategic partners. We"}
