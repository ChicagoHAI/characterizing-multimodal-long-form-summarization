The increased sales volume across all\ngeographic regions is due to higher demand from healthcare customers as well as a range of customers across other key verticals. The negative price/mix impact across the Americas and EMEA regions is driven by higher sales of lower priced printer models and mix of materials sales.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue from operations outside the U.S., including Latin America, EMEA and APAC, was 51.6% and 50.1% of total revenue, respectively.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table sets forth the change in revenue by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 2\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asia Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>632,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price/Mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,515\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,809\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,744\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(475\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,003\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated revenue increased 2.1%, driven by higher sales volume in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency, offset by a shift in product mix and average selling price across all geographic regions. The increase in revenue in the EMEA region primarily reflects higher sales volume, including the addition of Vertex and NextDent branded dental materials, and the favorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by a shift in product mix and average selling price. The decrease in revenue in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions are primarily due to a shift in product mix and average selling price, partially offset by an increase in sales volume in the Asia Pacific region.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue from operations outside the U.S., including Latin America, EMEA and APAC, was 50.1% and 47.9% of total revenue, respectively.\nComparison of revenue by class\nWe earn revenue from the sale of products, materials and services. The products category includes 3D printers, healthcare simulators and digitizers, as well as software, 3D scanners and haptic devices. The materials category includes a wide range of materials to be used with our 3D printers, the majority of which are proprietary, as well as acquired conventional dental materials. The services category includes warranty and maintenance on 3D printers and simulators, software maintenance, on demand manufacturing solutions and healthcare services.\nDue to the relatively high price of certain 3D printers and a corresponding lengthy selling cycle and relatively low unit volume of the higher priced printers in any particular period, a shift in the timing and concentration of orders and shipments from one period to another can affect reported revenue in any given period. Revenue reported in any particular period is also affected by timing of revenue recognition under rules prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nIn addition to changes in sales volumes and the impact of revenue from acquisitions, there are two other primary drivers of changes in revenue from one period to another: (1) the combined effect of changes in product mix and average selling prices, sometimes referred to as price and mix effects, and (2) the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies. As used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis, the price and mix effects relate to changes in revenue that are not able to be specifically related to changes in unit volume.\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table sets forth the change in revenue by class for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 3\n\u0eff\n\u0eff\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Totals\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price/Mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,656\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>687,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated revenue increased 6.4%, predominantly driven by higher sales volume across all revenue categories, including the\nimpact of new printers launched in 2018, and the favorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by a shift in sales mix which impacted average selling price for both products and materials.\nProducts revenue increased due to higher demand from healthcare and a wide range of other key verticals and for products across our portfolio, including the recently commercialized new products; partially offset by changes in sales mix which impacted average selling prices, including the impact of higher sales of lower priced printers. Revenue from printers increased 24.5% to $153.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $123.4 million in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, software revenue included in the products category, including scanners and haptic devices, contributed $51.7 million, an increase of 8.2%, compared to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in materials revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflects demand for materials driven by healthcare and industrial customers for our core and new materials, coupled with a favorable impact from foreign currency. The unfavorable price/mix impact is primarily driven by mix of sales during the year, including the impacts of product mix, geographic sales mix and volume purchase pricing.\nThe increase in services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by growth in healthcare, on demand manufacturing and software services revenue. Despite headwinds related to export compliance and changes in on demand outsourcing procedures and strategy in the second half of 2018, on demand manufacturing services revenue increased 2.2% to $107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, software revenue included in the services category contributed $44.6 million and $43.9 million, respectively.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table sets forth the change in revenue by class for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 4\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Totals\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>632,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price/Mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,979\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,744\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated revenue increased 2.1%, driven by increased sales volume in both materials and services as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency, offset by a shift in product mix and average selling prices.\nProducts revenue decreased due to changes in product mix and average selling prices, including a shift in demand for lower priced printers and a moderate decrease in sales volume. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue from printers contributed $123.4 million and $133.3 million, respectively. Software revenue included in the products category, including scanners and haptic devices, contributed $47.8 million and $44.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in materials revenue reflects continued utilization by the installed base and demand from healthcare customers, including acquired Vertex and NextDent dental materials. This increased demand was partially offset by a decrease related to a shift in product mix and average selling prices.\nServices revenue increased primarily due to higher demand for healthcare services. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue from on demand manufacturing services contributed $104.6 million and $104.4 million, respectively.

In addition, the inventory adjustment discussed below had a negative impact on margins in the comparable period for the prior year.\nProducts gross profit margin increased, primarily due to inventory adjustments totaling $12.9 million in 2017 that were a result of a comprehensive review of our portfolio and inventory and related primarily to legacy plastics printers, refurbished and used metals printers and parts having minimal or no use over extended periods, and a small increase in gross profit margin as a result of ongoing supply chain cost reduction efforts. Gross profit margin for materials decreased, reflecting the unfavorable impact of\nmix driven by geographic sales mix and product mix. Gross profit margin for services decreased, driven by lower on demand manufacturing margin which was partially offset by improved margins for software and maintenance services. On demand manufacturing services gross profit margin decreased to 35.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 43.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to mix of sales and lower utilization as we invested in several facilities globally to upgrade and expand capacity while at the same time exiting certain other facilities.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table sets forth gross profit and gross profit margins for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 6 Table 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Gross Profit Margin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Profit Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Profit Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,862\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,912\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in total consolidated gross profit is predominantly driven by changes in product mix. Also contributing to the decrease were the inventory adjustments totaling $12.9 million in 2017 versus adjustments of $10.7 million in the same period of 2016. The 2017 inventory adjustment resulted from a comprehensive review of our portfolio and inventory during the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2017 inventory adjustment primarily related to legacy plastics printers, refurbished and used metals printers and parts that have shown little to no use over extended periods. The majority of this adjustment relates to the products category. Gross profit for materials decreased primarily due to the addition of Vertex's conventional dental materials, which are lower gross profit margin than 3D printing materials. Gross profit margin for services decreased due to lower gross profit margins in printer services as we invested in addressing legacy issues and building out our service model, which offset the benefit of higher demand for healthcare services.

In 2016, the benefit primarily reflected a $3.3 million U.S. tax benefit and $2.8 million of tax expense in foreign jurisdictions.\nDuring 2018 and 2017, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions; therefore, we have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets totaling $95.4 million and $80.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFor further discussion, see Notes 2 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet loss attributable to 3D Systems\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table sets forth the primary components of net loss attributable to 3D Systems for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 11 Table 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,191\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53,973\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision (benefit) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to 3D Systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66,191\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares, basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss per share, basic and diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to a decrease in loss from operations and interest and other expense.

In doing so, we review and analyze our current cash on hand, the number of days our sales are outstanding, inventory turns, capital expenditure commitments and accounts payable turns. Our cash requirements primarily consist of funding of working capital and funding of capital expenditures.\nCash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity such as bank credit facilities and issuing equity or debt securities, are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we drew $25 million on our revolving credit line to support working capital and general corporate purposes.\nCash held outside the U.S. at December 31, 2018 was $73.3 million, or 66.7% of total cash and equivalents, compared to $88.9 million, or 65.2% of total cash and equivalents at December 31, 2017. Cash held outside the U.S. is used in our foreign operations for working capital purposes and is considered to be permanently invested. Cash equivalents are comprised of funds held in money market instruments and are reported at their current carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments. We strive to minimize our credit risk by investing primarily in investment grade, liquid instruments and limit exposure to any one issuer depending upon credit quality. See Cash flow\u201d, Credit facilities\u201d and Capitalized lease obligations\u201d below.\nWe acquired one business, Vertex, in 2017 for consideration of approximately $37.6 million, net of cash assumed, related to expanding our healthcare solutions portfolio, particularly within the dental vertical. Consideration consisted of approximately $34.3 in cash, net of cash assumed, and approximately $3.2 million in shares of the Company's common stock.\nDays sales outstanding was 69 days at December 31, 2018 compared to 73 days at December 31, 2017, while accounts receivable more than 90 days past due decreased to 8.9% of gross receivables at December 31, 2018, from 9.1% at December 31, 2017. We review specific receivables periodically to determine the appropriate reserve for accounts receivable.\nThe majority of our inventory consists of finished goods, including products, materials and service parts. Inventory also consists of raw materials for certain printers and service products.\nThe changes that make up the other components of working capital not discussed above resulted from the ordinary course of business. Differences between the amounts of working capital item changes in the cash flow statement and the balance sheet changes for the corresponding items are primarily the result of foreign currency translation adjustments.\nCash Flow\nThe following tables set forth components of cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 14 Table 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70,659\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,882\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,188\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,369\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,912\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48,417\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flow from operations\nTable 15\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65,323\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in working capital and all other operating assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,204\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $4.8 million, $26.1 million and $57.5 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2018 there was $25.0 million outstanding balance under the Prior Credit Agreement and no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2017. The Prior Credit Agreement contained customary covenants, some of which required the Company to\nmaintain certain financial ratios that determined the amounts available and terms of borrowings and events of default. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Prior Credit Agreement was terminated on February 27, 2019. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 27, 2019, we entered into a 5-year $100.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the Term Facility\u201d) and a 5-year $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Facility, the Senior Credit Facility\u201d), which replaced the Prior Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility were used to refinance the existing indebtedness under the Prior Credit Agreement and will be used to support working capital and for general corporate purposes. For further discussion of the Senior Credit Facility, see Item 9B and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\nThe minority interest shareholders of a certain subsidiary have the right to require us to acquire either a portion of or all ownership interest under certain circumstances pursuant to a contractual arrangement, and we have a similar call option under the same contractual terms. The amount of consideration under the put and call rights is not a fixed amount, but rather is dependent upon various valuation formulas and on future events, such as revenue and gross margin performance of the subsidiary through the date of exercise, as described in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management estimates, assuming that the subsidiary owned by us at December 31, 2018 performs at its forecasted earnings levels, that these rights, if exercised, could require us to pay an amount of approximately $8.9 million to the owners of such put rights. This amount has been recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interests on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and would be payable in 2019, if exercised.\nIndemnification\nIn the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements to indemnify customers or suppliers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\nTo the extent permitted under Delaware law, we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity, subject to limited exceptions. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, we have directors' and officers' insurance coverage that may enable us to recover future amounts paid, subject to a deductible and to the policy limits.\nFinancial Instruments\nWe conduct business in various countries using both the functional currencies of those countries and other currencies to effect cross border transactions. As a result, we are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the dates that those transactions are entered into and their respective settlement dates will result in a foreign exchange gain or loss. When practicable, we endeavor to match assets and liabilities in the same currency on our balance sheet and those of our subsidiaries in order to reduce these risks. We also, when we consider it to be appropriate, enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge exposures arising from those transactions. The Company had $75.3 million and $39.6 million in notional foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material.\nWe do not hedge for trading or speculative purposes, and our foreign currency contracts are generally short-term in nature, typically maturing in 90 days or less. We have elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d and therefore, we recognize all gains and losses (realized or unrealized) in interest and other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in interest and other expense, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss. Depending on their fair value at the end of the reporting period, derivatives are recorded either in prepaid and other current assets or in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains and losses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nPlease see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. A majority of the Company's revenue is recognized at the point in time when products are shipped or services are delivered to customers.\nThe Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Many of its contracts with customers include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation in a contract. For the majority of items, the Company estimates SSP using historical transaction data. The Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when the product or service is not sold separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nIn some circumstances, the Company has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers, geographic region or other factors. In these instances, the Company may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nThe determination of SSP is an ongoing process and information is reviewed regularly in order to ensure SSP reflects the most current information or trends.\nThe nature of the Company's marketing incentives may lead to consideration that is variable. Judgment is exercised at contract inception to determine the most likely outcome of the contract and resulting transaction price. Ongoing assessments are performed to determine if updates are needed to the original estimates.\nSee Notes 2 and 4, \"Revenue\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nIn evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable, we assess a number of factors, including specific customers' abilities to meet their financial obligations to us, the length of time receivables are past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we may record a reserve for specific customers, as well as a general reserve and allowance for returns and discounts. If circumstances related to specific customers change, or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe evaluate specific accounts for which we believe a customer may have an inability to meet their financial obligations (for example, aging over 90 days past due or bankruptcy). In these cases, we use our judgment, based on available facts and circumstances, and record a specific reserve for that customer to reduce the receivable to an amount we expect to collect. These specific reserves are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (\"IRS\") and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method.\nThe inventory reserve is a critical estimate as there is rapid technological change in our industry impacting the market for our products and there is significant judgment in estimating the amount of spare parts to keep on hand to service previously sold printers for periods of up 10 or more years.\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nWe review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived asset over its estimated fair value as determined by discounted projected cash flows.\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value and then, if necessary, measure the amount of the impairment loss. The process requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units based primarily on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations, which requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit.\nWe conducted our annual impairment testing for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 in the fourth quarters. There was no goodwill impairment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nContingencies\nWe record an estimated loss from a contingency when information indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires us to use our judgment and the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known.\nSee Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and expected impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed analysis of the company's financial condition, operations, and strategic initiatives.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. Certain statements contained in this discussion may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in any forward-looking statements, as discussed more fully in this Form 10-K. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nOverview and Strategy\nWe provide comprehensive 3D printing solutions, including 3D printers, materials, software, on demand manufacturing services and digital design tools. Our solutions support advanced applications in a wide range of industries and key verticals including healthcare, aerospace, automotive and durable goods. Our precision healthcare capabilities include simulation, Virtual Surgical Planning ( VSP\u2122\u201d), and printing of medical and dental devices, models, surgical guides and instruments. Our experience and expertise have proven vital to our development of an ecosystem and end-to-end digital workflow solutions which enable customers to optimize product designs, transform workflows, bring innovative products to market and drive new business models.\nWe are pursuing a strategy focused on offering a comprehensive ecosystem that provides solutions aimed at healthcare, dental, aerospace, automotive and durable goods verticals to address professional and industrial applications. We believe a shift in 3D printing from prototyping to also using additive manufacturing for production is underway. We are focused on innovation and new products to drive expansion into 3D production through improving durability, reliability, repeatability and total cost of operations of 3D printing solutions.\nWe have launched new 3D printers with increased speeds and capabilities as well as introduced materials with improved strength, durability, elasticity and high temperature capabilities, developments we believe are well suited for advanced and demanding applications. We have also expanded and strengthened our software portfolio to help enhance our customers' workflows from digitize to design to simulate to manufacture, inspect and manage. We plan to continue to invest in development of hardware, software, materials and services to provide comprehensive solutions in plastics and metals to address significant market opportunities with a use-case by use-case approach, focusing on solving specific customer applications and needs within our targeted vertical markets.\nTo execute this strategy, we are focusing on an operating framework and go-to-market model that drives sustainable, long-term growth and profitability. We are balancing investments to support process improvements, infrastructure enhancements and focused innovation to transform the Company, while also driving an appropriate cost structure. We expect to be able to support growth by prioritizing and focusing our resources, leveraging our technology and domain expertise and maintaining and expanding strong customer and partner relationships. As with any growth strategy, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in accomplishing our strategic initiatives.\nRecent Developments\nThroughout 2018, we launched several next generation additive manufacturing solutions, a range of materials and new software releases. In February 2018, we introduced the NextDent 5100, a Figure 4-based 3D printer specifically designed for dental labs, which we believe is a breakthrough product for digital dentistry in terms of cost and capabilities. At the same time, we launched several new materials, bringing the total number to 30 dental-specific materials for the NextDent 5100. Additionally we launched the FabPro 1000, a low cost, high productivity DLP-based 3D printer designed for dental and jewelry production as well as high functionality and throughput, industrial prototyping. We began shipping our next generation SLS printer, the ProX SLS 6100, with six production-grade materials to deliver superior part quality with greater efficiency and lower total cost of operation versus competitors. We launched the ProJet MJP 2500 IC designed to eliminate the cost and time of tooling and storage with 3D printed wax patterns that can be used seamlessly in existing foundry casting processes. We also commercialized Figure 4 stand alone and production solutions, innovative, high-speed production solutions capable of six sigma repeatability and matching injection molding part quality.\nIn June 2018, we announced a strategic partnership with GF Machining Solutions (\"GF\"), one of the world's leading providers of complete solutions to the precision machining industry and to manufacturers of precision components. We believe this partnership greatly enhances our metals printing distribution, scalability and automation. In September 2018, we debuted the DMP Factory 500, the first joint solution developed as part of our partnership with GF. The DMP Factory 500 is optimized for scalability, repeatable high quality parts, high throughput and low total cost of operation with the ability to print the largest part diameter available today. We also began shipping the DMP Flex 350 and DMP Factory 350, designed for volume production of critical\ncomponents for industrial applications such as aerospace, healthcare, and transportation. Our DMP solutions offer durable and removable print modules, powder management modules, a broad range of metals materials and fully integrated 3DXpert software to help streamline the production of parts. All of the new products above were commercially available by December 31, 2018.\n2018 Summary\nTotal consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 6.4%, or $41.6 million, to $687.7 million, compared to $646.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The lower cash balance was the result of our investments in go-to-market, IT infrastructure, new product launches, and higher legal expenses related to compliance and regulatory matters and payments related to previous litigation settlements.\nResults of Operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016\nComparison of revenue by geographic region\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table sets forth the change in revenue by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 1\n\nConsolidated revenue increased 6.4%, predominantly driven by higher sales volume across all geographic regions, including recently commercialized new 3D printers, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of price/mix in the Americas and EMEA regions, which was driven by product mix, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The increased sales volume across all\ngeographic regions is due to higher demand from healthcare customers as well as a range of customers across other key verticals. The negative price/mix impact across the Americas and EMEA regions is driven by higher sales of lower priced printer models and mix of materials sales.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue from operations outside the U.S., including Latin America, EMEA and APAC, was 51.6% and 50.1% of total revenue, respectively.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table sets forth the change in revenue by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 2\n\nConsolidated revenue increased 2.1%, driven by higher sales volume in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency, offset by a shift in product mix and average selling price across all geographic regions. The increase in revenue in the EMEA region primarily reflects higher sales volume, including the addition of Vertex and NextDent branded dental materials, and the favorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by a shift in product mix and average selling price. The decrease in revenue in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions are primarily due to a shift in product mix and average selling price, partially offset by an increase in sales volume in the Asia Pacific region.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue from operations outside the U.S., including Latin America, EMEA and APAC, was 50.1% and 47.9% of total revenue, respectively.\nComparison of revenue by class\nWe earn revenue from the sale of products, materials and services. The products category includes 3D printers, healthcare simulators and digitizers, as well as software, 3D scanners and haptic devices. The materials category includes a wide range of materials to be used with our 3D printers, the majority of which are proprietary, as well as acquired conventional dental materials. The services category includes warranty and maintenance on 3D printers and simulators, software maintenance, on demand manufacturing solutions and healthcare services.\nDue to the relatively high price of certain 3D printers and a corresponding lengthy selling cycle and relatively low unit volume of the higher priced printers in any particular period, a shift in the timing and concentration of orders and shipments from one period to another can affect reported revenue in any given period. Revenue reported in any particular period is also affected by timing of revenue recognition under rules prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nIn addition to changes in sales volumes and the impact of revenue from acquisitions, there are two other primary drivers of changes in revenue from one period to another: (1) the combined effect of changes in product mix and average selling prices, sometimes referred to as price and mix effects, and (2) the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies. As used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis, the price and mix effects relate to changes in revenue that are not able to be specifically related to changes in unit volume.\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table sets forth the change in revenue by class for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 3\n\u0eff\n\u0eff\n\nConsolidated revenue increased 6.4%, predominantly driven by higher sales volume across all revenue categories, including the\nimpact of new printers launched in 2018, and the favorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by a shift in sales mix which impacted average selling price for both products and materials.\nProducts revenue increased due to higher demand from healthcare and a wide range of other key verticals and for products across our portfolio, including the recently commercialized new products; partially offset by changes in sales mix which impacted average selling prices, including the impact of higher sales of lower priced printers. Revenue from printers increased 24.5% to $153.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $123.4 million in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, software revenue included in the products category, including scanners and haptic devices, contributed $51.7 million, an increase of 8.2%, compared to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in materials revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflects demand for materials driven by healthcare and industrial customers for our core and new materials, coupled with a favorable impact from foreign currency. The unfavorable price/mix impact is primarily driven by mix of sales during the year, including the impacts of product mix, geographic sales mix and volume purchase pricing.\nThe increase in services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by growth in healthcare, on demand manufacturing and software services revenue. Despite headwinds related to export compliance and changes in on demand outsourcing procedures and strategy in the second half of 2018, on demand manufacturing services revenue increased 2.2% to $107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, software revenue included in the services category contributed $44.6 million and $43.9 million, respectively.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table sets forth the change in revenue by class for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 4\n\nConsolidated revenue increased 2.1%, driven by increased sales volume in both materials and services as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency, offset by a shift in product mix and average selling prices.\nProducts revenue decreased due to changes in product mix and average selling prices, including a shift in demand for lower priced printers and a moderate decrease in sales volume. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue from printers contributed $123.4 million and $133.3 million, respectively. Software revenue included in the products category, including scanners and haptic devices, contributed $47.8 million and $44.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe increase in materials revenue reflects continued utilization by the installed base and demand from healthcare customers, including acquired Vertex and NextDent dental materials. This increased demand was partially offset by a decrease related to a shift in product mix and average selling prices.\nServices revenue increased primarily due to higher demand for healthcare services. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue from on demand manufacturing services contributed $104.6 million and $104.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, software services revenue contributed $43.9 million and $43.2 million, respectively.\nGross profit and gross profit margins\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table sets forth gross profit and gross profit margins for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 5\n\nThe increase in total consolidated gross profit is due to the increase in product sales, primarily higher sales of printers. In addition, the inventory adjustment discussed below had a negative impact on margins in the comparable period for the prior year.\nProducts gross profit margin increased, primarily due to inventory adjustments totaling $12.9 million in 2017 that were a result of a comprehensive review of our portfolio and inventory and related primarily to legacy plastics printers, refurbished and used metals printers and parts having minimal or no use over extended periods, and a small increase in gross profit margin as a result of ongoing supply chain cost reduction efforts. Gross profit margin for materials decreased, reflecting the unfavorable impact of\nmix driven by geographic sales mix and product mix. Gross profit margin for services decreased, driven by lower on demand manufacturing margin which was partially offset by improved margins for software and maintenance services. On demand manufacturing services gross profit margin decreased to 35.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 43.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to mix of sales and lower utilization as we invested in several facilities globally to upgrade and expand capacity while at the same time exiting certain other facilities.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table sets forth gross profit and gross profit margins for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 6 \nThe decrease in total consolidated gross profit is predominantly driven by changes in product mix. Also contributing to the decrease were the inventory adjustments totaling $12.9 million in 2017 versus adjustments of $10.7 million in the same period of 2016. The 2017 inventory adjustment resulted from a comprehensive review of our portfolio and inventory during the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2017 inventory adjustment primarily related to legacy plastics printers, refurbished and used metals printers and parts that have shown little to no use over extended periods. The majority of this adjustment relates to the products category. Gross profit for materials decreased primarily due to the addition of Vertex's conventional dental materials, which are lower gross profit margin than 3D printing materials. Gross profit margin for services decreased due to lower gross profit margins in printer services as we invested in addressing legacy issues and building out our service model, which offset the benefit of higher demand for healthcare services. On demand manufacturing services gross profit margin remained flat at 43.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 43.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating expenses\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table sets forth the components of operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 7 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased due to additional employee related costs, in particular to support selling & marketing activities incurred in connection with the launch of new products during 2018, continued investment in IT infrastructure, and higher legal expenses; partially offset by a reduction in outside services costs.\nResearch and development expenses remained relatively flat as our increased investment in our workforce was offset by a reduction in outside services costs and a reduced materials spend related to products which have been brought to market during 2018.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table sets forth the components of operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 8 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to our investments in go-to-market and IT infrastructure and additional talent and resources, as well as repairs and maintenance costs, offset by lower stock compensation expense due to the impact of adopting a new accounting standard which resulted in a change in our policy for accounting for award forfeitures.\nResearch and development expenses increased due to focused innovation to drive customers' shift to 3D production, including investment in plastics, in particular our Figure 4 platform, metals, materials and software as well as the addition of talent and resources. Research and development for 2016 included $4.6 million of expense related to", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

The increase in revenue in the EMEA region primarily reflects higher sales volume, including the addition of Vertex and NextDent branded dental materials, and the favorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by a shift in product mix and average selling price. The decrease in revenue in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions are primarily due to a shift in product mix and average selling price, partially offset by an increase in sales volume in the Asia Pacific region.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue from operations outside the U.S., including Latin America, EMEA and APAC, was 50.1% and 47.9% of total revenue, respectively.\nComparison of revenue by class\nWe earn revenue from the sale of products, materials and services. The products category includes 3D printers, healthcare simulators and digitizers, as well as software, 3D scanners and haptic devices. The materials category includes a wide range of materials to be used with our 3D printers, the majority of which are proprietary, as well as acquired conventional dental materials. The services category includes warranty and maintenance on 3D printers and simulators, software maintenance, on demand manufacturing solutions and healthcare services.\nDue to the relatively high price of certain 3D printers and a corresponding lengthy selling cycle and relatively low unit volume of the higher priced printers in any particular period, a shift in the timing and concentration of orders and shipments from one period to another can affect reported revenue in any given period. Revenue reported in any particular period is also affected by timing of revenue recognition under rules prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nIn addition to changes in sales volumes and the impact of revenue from acquisitions, there are two other primary drivers of changes in revenue from one period to another: (1) the combined effect of changes in product mix and average selling prices, sometimes referred to as price and mix effects, and (2) the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies. As used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis, the price and mix effects relate to changes in revenue that are not able to be specifically related to changes in unit volume.\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table sets forth the change in revenue by class for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 3\n\u0eff\n\u0eff\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Totals\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price/Mix\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,656\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue - 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>687,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated revenue increased 6.4%, predominantly driven by higher sales volume across all revenue categories, including the\nimpact of new printers launched in 2018, and the favorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by a shift in sales mix which impacted average selling price for both products and materials.\nProducts revenue increased due to higher demand from healthcare and a wide range of other key verticals and for products across our portfolio, including the recently commercialized new products; partially offset by changes in sales mix which impacted average selling prices, including the impact of higher sales of lower priced printers. Revenue from printers increased 24.5% to $153.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $123.4 million in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, software revenue included in the products category, including scanners and haptic devices, contributed $51.7 million, an increase of 8.2%, compared to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in materials revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflects demand for materials driven by healthcare and industrial customers for our core and new materials, coupled with a favorable impact from foreign currency. The unfavorable price/mix impact is primarily driven by mix of sales during the year, including the impacts of product mix, geographic sales mix and volume purchase pricing.\nThe increase in services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by growth in healthcare, on demand manufacturing and software services revenue. Despite headwinds related to export compliance and changes in on demand outsourcing procedures and strategy in the second half of 2018, on demand manufacturing services revenue increased 2.2% to $107.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

In addition, the inventory adjustment discussed below had a negative impact on margins in the comparable period for the prior year.\nProducts gross profit margin increased, primarily due to inventory adjustments totaling $12.9 million in 2017 that were a result of a comprehensive review of our portfolio and inventory and related primarily to legacy plastics printers, refurbished and used metals printers and parts having minimal or no use over extended periods, and a small increase in gross profit margin as a result of ongoing supply chain cost reduction efforts. Gross profit margin for materials decreased, reflecting the unfavorable impact of\nmix driven by geographic sales mix and product mix. Gross profit margin for services decreased, driven by lower on demand manufacturing margin which was partially offset by improved margins for software and maintenance services. On demand manufacturing services gross profit margin decreased to 35.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 43.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to mix of sales and lower utilization as we invested in several facilities globally to upgrade and expand capacity while at the same time exiting certain other facilities.\n2017 compared to 2016\nThe following table sets forth gross profit and gross profit margins for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 6 Table 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Gross Profit Margin\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Profit Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross Profit Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,862\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,912\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in total consolidated gross profit is predominantly driven by changes in product mix. Also contributing to the decrease were the inventory adjustments totaling $12.9 million in 2017 versus adjustments of $10.7 million in the same period of 2016. The 2017 inventory adjustment resulted from a comprehensive review of our portfolio and inventory during the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2017 inventory adjustment primarily related to legacy plastics printers, refurbished and used metals printers and parts that have shown little to no use over extended periods. The majority of this adjustment relates to the products category. Gross profit for materials decreased primarily due to the addition of Vertex's conventional dental materials, which are lower gross profit margin than 3D printing materials. Gross profit margin for services decreased due to lower gross profit margins in printer services as we invested in addressing legacy issues and building out our service model, which offset the benefit of higher demand for healthcare services. On demand manufacturing services gross profit margin remained flat at 43.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 43.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating expenses\n2018 compared to 2017\nThe following table sets forth the components of operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 7 Table 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>358,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased due to additional employee related costs, in particular to support selling & marketing activities incurred in connection with the launch of new products during 2018, continued investment in IT infrastructure, and higher legal expenses;
