This section provides a summary of recent accounting pronouncements and discusses their potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNON-GAAP CLARIFICATION\nAlthough our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), we believe describing revenue and expenses, excluding the effects of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, as well as certain other charges, net, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Specifically, management believes that organic revenue and free cash flow, both non-GAAP financial measures, as well as non-GAAP gross profit margin and non-GAAP operating margin, provide relevant and useful information that is widely used by equity analysts, investors and competitors in our industry, as well as by our management, in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance. We define the term organic revenue as GAAP revenue excluding the effect of foreign currency translation changes and the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. We define the term non-GAAP gross profit margin as GAAP gross profit margin with certain non-GAAP measures excluded and non-GAAP operating margin as GAAP operating margin with certain non-GAAP measures excluded. These non-GAAP measures exclude costs related to restructuring actions, acquisition and related integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, costs associated with our global information technology transition initiative, and other non-operational costs that are infrequent or non-recurring in nature and we believe these are useful measures to evaluate our continuing business.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business as it indicates the amount of cash generated after additions to property, plant, and equipment which is available for, among other things, investments in our business, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and repayment of debt. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because our management believes they provide more comparable measures of our continuing business because they adjust for\ncertain items that are not reflective of the underlying performance of our business. These measures may also be useful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. We regularly use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business results and make operating decisions. We also measure our employees and compensate them, in part, based on such non-GAAP measures and use this information for our planning and forecasting activities. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable among companies.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-performance scientific instruments and analytical and diagnostic solutions that enable our customers to explore life and materials at microscopic, molecular and cellular levels. Our corporate headquarters are located in Billerica, Massachusetts. We maintain major technical and manufacturing centers in Europe and North America, and we have sales offices located throughout the world. Bruker is organized into three reportable segments: the BSI Life Science Segment (comprised of the Bruker BioSpin Group and the Bruker CALID Group), the BSI NANO Segment and the Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST) Segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue increased by $177.0 million, or 9.3%, to $2,072.6 million, compared to $1,895.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in revenue were increases of approximately $118.4 million attributable to our recent acquisitions and a decrease of approximately $50.3 million from the impact of foreign currency translation in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $108.9 million, or 5.7%.\nOur gross profit margin increased to 48.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 47.5% during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit margin resulted primarily from operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOur operating margin increased to 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 13.8% during the year ended December 31, 2018. Our operating margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to volume and operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by continued investments in our strategic growth areas.\nThe income tax provision in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $82.4 million and $63.7 million, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 29.4% and 26.0%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily attributable to a benefit recorded in 2018 associated with the reversal of state and foreign withholding taxes on unremitted earnings that did not recur in 2019 and additional tax reserves for uncertain tax positions in Europe in 2019. Our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of jurisdictional income changes. Earnings per share increased to $1.26 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.14 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase compared to the prior year was driven primarily by revenue growth, higher gross and operating profit offset by an increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a source of cash of $213.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, was $140.4 million, calculated as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 213.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 239.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 154.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 140.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 190.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 110.7\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our free cash flow was 26% lower than for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily attributable to higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash items were more than offset by an increase in capital expenditures and the timing of inventory purchases.\nOn December 11, 2019, we entered into (1) a new revolving credit agreement to establish a new revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $600 million; (2) a term loan agreement to establish a new term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million; and (3) a note purchase agreement to issue and sell CHF 297 million aggregate principal amount of 1.01% senior notes due December 11, 2029. Floating interest rates under the term loan were simultaneously fixed through cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements into Euro ($150 million) and Swiss Franc ($150 million) rates carrying average effective interest rates of 0.94% and hedge our net investment in our Euro and Swiss Franc denominated net assets. The new revolving credit agreement replaced our $500 million five-year revolving credit agreement established on October 27, 2015, that was terminated on December 11, 2019. In addition, we designated our CHF 297 million senior notes as a hedge in our net investment in our Swiss Franc denominated net assets. Proceeds from this financing were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under our prior 2015 revolving credit facility and we intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes and to support corporate strategic objectives. During December 2019, we entered into U.S. Dollar to Euro cross-currency swaps on our existing 2012 private placement notes of $105 million 4.31% Series 2012A Senior Notes, Tranche C, due January 18, 2022, and the existing $100 million 4.46% Series 2012A Senior Notes, Tranche D, due January 18, 2024, resulting in an average effective interest rate of 2.25% on these instruments. The cross-currency swaps hedge our net investment in our Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these interest rate and cross currency swap agreements, we reduced our interest expense by $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. We anticipate these swap agreements will lower net interest expense in future years.\nOn February 22, 2016, we announced the establishment of a dividend policy and the declaration by our Board of Directors of an initial quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share of our issued and outstanding common stock. Dividends amounting to $25.0 million and $25.1 million were paid during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Future dividend payments, if any, are subject to approval of our Board of Directors. We are targeting a cash dividend to our shareholders in the amount of $0.16 per share per annum, payable in equal quarterly installments.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we completed various acquisitions that complemented our existing market offerings and added aftermarket and software capabilities. The impact of the acquired companies on revenues, net income and total assets was not material.\nWe can experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of various factors, some of which are outside our control, such as:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the timing of governmental stimulus programs and academic research budgets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the time it takes between the date customer orders and deposits are received, systems are shipped and accepted by our customers and full payment is received; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>foreign currency exchange rates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the time it takes for us to receive critical materials to manufacture our products; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>general economic conditions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the time it takes to satisfy local customs requirements and other export/import requirements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the time it takes for customers to construct or prepare their facilities for our products; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the time required to obtain governmental licenses. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese factors have in the past affected the amount and timing of revenue recognized on sales of our products and receipt of related payments and will continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not necessarily be an indication of any future quarter's operating performance.\nAs previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 18, 2020, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee) initiated an internal investigation into an allegation recently received in connection with our year-end close, primarily relating to income tax matters including the effective income tax rate for 2019 and the related income tax balance sheet accounts. The Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent, experienced external legal counsel, and independent forensic accountants, concluded its investigation in March 2020. The Investigation did not identify any material misstatements or omissions regarding our financial statements, misconduct, violations of our Code of Conduct, or tone at the top failures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table presents our results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions, except per share data):\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,744.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,576.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 322.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 311.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,072.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,895.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 878.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 801.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of service revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 193.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,077.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 995.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 995.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 900.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 444.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 187.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other charges, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 694.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 637.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 280.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 244.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Bruker Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 197.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 179.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per common share attributable to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bruker Corporation shareholders:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.15\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.14\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 155.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 156.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 156.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157.2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue increased by $177.0 million, or 9.3%, to $2,072.6 million, compared to $1,895.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our revenues included $118.4 million attributable to our recent acquisitions and a decrease of approximately $50.3 million from the impact of foreign currency translation in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $108.9 million, or 5.7%.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $995.3 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 48.0%, compared to $900.0 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 47.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $41.7 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP gross profit margin was 50.0% and 49.0% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $500.2 million, or 24.1% of revenue, from $444.7 million, or 23.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily caused by the addition of recent acquisitions and select investments in strategic growth areas, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $187.7 million, or 9.1% of revenue, from $173.4 million, or 9.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The dollar increase was driven primarily by the addition of recent acquisitions, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOther Charges, Net\nOther charges, net was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The charges consisted primarily of $(3.9) million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $4.6 million of acquisition-related charges related to acquisitions completed in 2019 and 2018, $3.7 million of costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative, and $2.1 million related to professional fees. The restructuring charges included a gain on the sale of a building of $7.7 million.\nOther charges, net was $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The charges consisted primarily of $6.8 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.4 million of acquisition-related charges related to acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017, $4.8 million of costs associated with our global information technology (IT) transformation initiative and $4.5 million related to professional fees.\nIn 2020, we expect to incur $10.0 to $15.0 million of expense related to various outsourcing initiatives and other restructuring activities that were implemented in 2019 or will commence in 2020.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment is required.\nWe will continue to monitor goodwill and long-lived intangible assets, as well as long-lived tangible assets, for possible future impairment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $300.9 million, resulting in an operating margin of 14.5%, compared to operating income of $262.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in operating income were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $63.1 million and $55.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was were 17.6% and 16.8% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin was due primarily to volume and operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2019 was ($20.5) million, compared to ($17.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net interest expense in 2019 was primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt balances in 2019 compared to 2018 being marginally offset by interest income from the new 2019 U.S. Dollar-to-Euro and U.S. Dollar to Swiss Franc interest rate cross-currency swap agreements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $14.7 million, realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $3.3 million, and $2.5 million related to pension plan expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $11.4 million, realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $3.0 million, and $3.9 million related to pension plan expenses.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe income tax provision in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $82.4 million and $63.7 million, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 29.4% and 26.0%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily attributable to a benefit recorded in 2018 associated with the reversal of state and foreign withholding taxes on unremitted earnings that did not recur in 2019 and additional tax reserves for uncertain tax positions in Europe in 2019.

The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest represented the minority shareholders' proportionate share of the net income recorded by our majority-owned indirect subsidiaries.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $197.2 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to net income of $179.7 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, for 2018. The increase compared to the prior year was driven primarily by revenue growth, higher gross and operating profit offset by an increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSegment Results\nRevenue\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue, and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI Life Science\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,244.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,138.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 106.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI Nano\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 632.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 568.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BEST\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,072.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,895.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 177.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor financial reporting purposes, we aggregate Bruker BioSpin Group and Bruker CALID Group as the BSI Life Science Segment. This aggregation reflects the similar economic characteristics, production processes, customer services provided, types and classes of customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environments.\nBSI Life Science Segment revenue increased by $106.0 million to $1,244.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,138.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Bruker BioSpin Group revenue increase was primarily due to growth in the system revenue, which included the revenue recognition of three GHz class systems, as well as aftermarket revenue and a small contribution from recent software acquisitions. The increase in Bruker CALID Group revenue was a result of continued strong demand for life science mass spectrometry and microbiology products, growth in molecular spectroscopy FT-IR and NIR products and contributions from an acquisition.\nBSI NANO Segment revenue increased by $64.6 million to $632.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $568.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The revenue increase was primarily the result of acquisitions as well as continued demand for advanced X-Ray and nano analysis products, partially offset by a sharp decline in demand for semiconductor metrology products and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nBEST Segment revenue increased by $15.1 million to $209.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $194.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenue resulted primarily from shipments of superconductors for healthcare applications offset in part by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nOperating Income\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\nTable 123: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI Life Science\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 290.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 244.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI NANO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BEST\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate, eliminations and other (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 300.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 262.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe operating margin expansion for BSI Life Science and BEST was primarily due to positive operating leverage on higher sales mix and operational improvements as well as favorable foreign currency translation for the BSI Life Science Segment.

Included in revenue were an increase of approximately $28.2 million attributable to our recent acquisitions and an increase of approximately $25.5 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus\nthe Euro and other currencies. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $76.0 million, or 4.3%.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $900.0 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 47.5%, compared to $816.0 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 46.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $28.7 million and $36.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP gross profit margins were 49.0% and 48.3% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to positive operating leverage on higher sales volume and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $444.7 million, or 23.5% of revenue, from $415.2 million, or 23.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily caused by the effect of recent acquisitions.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $173.4 million, or 9.1% of revenue, from $161.6 million, or 9.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily caused by the effect of recent acquisitions.\nOther Charges, Net\nOther charges, net was $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The charges consisted primarily of $6.8 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.4 million of acquisition-related charges related to acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017, $4.8 million of costs associated with our global information technology (IT) transformation initiative and $4.5 million related to professional fees.\nOther charges, net was $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The charges consisted primarily of $10.6 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $4.5 million related primarily to additional contingent consideration recognized for the acquisition of Jordan Valley Semiconductors, Ltd. (Jordan Valley) based upon an increase in revenue levels of the acquired business which increased the amount of expected earn out payments, $4.2 million of costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative and impairment charges of $0.2 million comprised of other long-lived assets related to the restructuring actions.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $262.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.8%, compared to income from operations of $219.5 million, resulting in an operating margin of 12.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The operating margin expansion was primarily due to increased revenue, favorable product mix, as well as ongoing operational improvements. This was partially offset by negative foreign currency translation effects, which occurred primarily in the first half of the year. Included in operating income were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $55.5 million and $61.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 16.8% and 15.9% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our GAAP and non-GAAP\noperating margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2018 despite significant unfavorable foreign currency translation effects.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2018 was ($17.7) million, compared to ($21.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $11.4 million, realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $3.0 million and $3.9 million related to pension plan expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $14.6 million, realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $5.5 million and $4.8 million related to pension plan expenses, partially offset by $2.1 million of proceeds from a cargo insurance settlement and a gain on acquisition of $0.6 million.\nThe 2017 interest and other income (expense), net amounts have been revised to reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 related to the reclassification of certain pension costs.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe income tax provision in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $63.7 million and $117.5 million, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 26.0% and 59.4%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily attributable to the absence of U.S. tax reform related charges in 2017. Our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of jurisdictional income changes.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.3 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $179.7 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to net income of $78.6 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for 2017. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by higher revenues, operational improvements and the absence of U.S. tax reform related charges that were incurred in 2017, as noted above.\nSegment Results\nRevenue\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue, and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions):\nTable 126: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI Life Science\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,138.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,070.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 68.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI NANO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 568.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 513.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BEST\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,895.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,765.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 129.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe BSI Life Science Segment revenue increased by $68.0 million to $1,138.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1,070.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Bruker BioSpin Group revenue increase was primarily attributable to the strong performance in biopharma, clinical research, applied and aftermarket businesses. The Bruker CALID Group revenue increase was primarily the result of strong performance in the microbiology, life science mass spectrometry and FTIR/NIR molecular spectroscopy businesses, together with contributions from our recent microbiology and diagnostics acquisitions. The strong performance in our mass spectrometry and molecular spectroscopy businesses was offset in part by a decline in revenue for CBRNE products.\nThe BSI NANO Segment revenue increased by $55.1 million to $568.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $513.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The revenue increase was primarily driven by solid performance in academic and industrial materials research markets for our X-Ray, nano surfaces and nano analysis tools, partially offset by lower revenue from semiconductor metrology markets. The BSI NANO Segment also benefited from contributions from recent acquisitions, mainly Anasys Instruments and JPK Instruments\nBEST Segment revenue increased by $3.6 million to $194.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $191.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The modest increase in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2018 over the prior year was due to a $5.0 million favorable foreign currency translation effect caused by the fluctuation of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro.\nOperating Income\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions):\nTable 128: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI Life Science\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 244.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 212.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI NANO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BEST\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate, eliminations and other (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24.4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 262.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 219.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td>(a) </td> <td>Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating margin increased primarily because of the gross profit and operational improvements noted above.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe anticipate that our existing cash and credit facilities will be sufficient to support our operating and investing needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future cash requirements could be affected by acquisitions that we may complete, repurchases of our common stock, or the payment of dividends in the future. Historically, we have financed our growth and liquidity needs through cash flow generation and a combination of debt financings and issuances of common stock. In the future, there are no assurances that we will continue to generate cash flow from operations or that additional financing alternatives will be available to us, if required, or if available, will be obtained on terms favorable to us.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $213.4 million, resulting primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $287.9 million, offset by a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, of $74.5 million. The decrease in\noperating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily caused by an increase in inventory build for 2020 orders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $239.7 million, resulting primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $281.9 million, offset by a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, of $42.2 million. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily caused by an increase in accounts receivable caused by proportionately higher sales late in the fourth quarter of 2018 and inventory build for 2019 orders, which were offset in part by cash received from customer advances.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $158.4 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $123.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to net cash paid for acquisitions of $90.0 million, net capital expenditures of $62.0 million and the purchase of short-term investments of $6.4 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $123.4 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $30.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to net cash paid for acquisitions of $191.6 million and net capital expenditures of $48.8 million. These activities were offset, in part, by net cash proceeds of short-term investments of $117.0 million.\nWe expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately $100.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $300.0 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $112.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily caused by $597.9 million of new debt borrowings, described below, offset in part by $361.9 million of repayments under revolving lines of credit. Other cash uses were $142.3 million used for the repurchase of common shares, $25.0 million for the payment of dividends and $15.0 million repayment on the 2012 Note Purchase Agreement. Other cash sources borrowings of $250.6 million under the revolving lines of credit and $10.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises.\nOn December 11, 2019, we entered into (1) a new revolving credit agreement to establish a new revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $600 million; (2) a term loan agreement to establish a new term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million; and (3) a note purchase agreement to issue and sell CHF 297 million aggregate principal amount of 1.01% senior notes due December 11, 2029. Floating interest rates under the term loan were simultaneously fixed through cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements into Euro ($150 million) and Swiss Franc ($150 million) rates carrying average effective interest rates of 0.94% and hedge our net investment in our Euro and Swiss Franc denominated net assets. The new revolving credit agreement replaced our $500 million five-year revolving credit agreement established on October 27, 2015, that was terminated on December 11, 2019. In addition, we designated our CHF 297 million senior notes as a hedge in our net investment in our Swiss Franc denominated net assets. Proceeds from this financing were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under our prior 2015 revolving credit facility and we intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes and to support corporate strategic objectives. During December 2019, we entered into U.S. Dollar to Euro cross-currency swaps on our existing 2012 private placement notes of $105 million 4.31% Series 2012A Senior Notes, Tranche C, due January 18, 2022, and the existing $100 million 4.46% Series 2012A Senior Notes, Tranche D, due January 18, 2024, resulting in an average effective interest rate of 2.25% on these instruments. The cross-currency swaps hedge our net investment in our Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these interest rate and cross currency swap agreements, we reduced our interest expense by $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. We anticipate these swap agreements will lower net interest expense in future years.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have entered into several cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $150 million of U.S. Dollar to Swiss Franc and a notional value of $355 million of U.S. Dollar to Euro to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on portions of our Euro and Swiss Franc denominated net asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, we lowered our net interest expense by $0.6 million during 2019. We anticipate these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately $8.8 million in 2020, $8.8 million in 2021 and $4.8 million in 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $112.4 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $159.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily caused by $218.1 million of repayments under revolving lines of credit and $25.1 million used for the payment of dividends. These cash uses were partially offset by borrowings of $129.4 million under the revolving lines of credit and $9.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises.\nIn May 2019, our Board of Directors approved the Repurchase Program under which repurchases of common stock in the amount of up to $300.0 million were authorized to occur from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as we deem appropriate, subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. In 2019, we repurchased 3,323,104 shares of common stock with an aggregate cost of approximately $142.3 million under the 2019 Repurchase Program. The remaining authorization as of March 20, 2020 is $157.7 million. We intend to fund any additional repurchases from cash on hand, future cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The repurchased shares are reflected within Treasury stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $684.9 million and $322.4 million, respectively, of which $301.1 million and $280.9 million, respectively, related to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside of the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries, most significantly in the Netherlands and Switzerland.\nAt December 31, 2019 and in accordance with the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded state and foreign withholding taxes, as well as subsequent foreign currency translations on these withholding taxes as they are an obligation of the parent company, on the cash and liquid assets portion of the unremitted earnings and profits (E&P) of foreign subsidiaries expected to be repatriated from our foreign subsidiaries to the United States. We continue to be indefinitely reinvested in the amount of $477 million of non-cash E&P that is subject to the 2017 Tax Act deemed repatriation. If this E&P is ultimately distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise we would likely be subject to additional withholding tax. We will continue to evaluate our assertions on the cumulative historical outside basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019. The amount of unrecognized deferred withholding taxes on the undistributed E&P was $58 million at December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $38.8 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce state taxable income that are expected to expire at various times beginning in 2020; approximately $82.7 million of net operating losses available to reduce German federal income and trade taxes that are carried forward indefinitely and $13.2 million of other foreign net operating losses that are expected to expire at various times beginning in 2020. We also had U.S. state research and development tax credits of $7.7 million. Utilization of these credits and state net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership percentage change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions. In the event of a deemed change in control under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses and credits may result in the expiration of all or a portion of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards.\nUncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018 we had the following debt outstanding (dollars in millions):\nTable 130: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td>

commitments include agreements to purchase goods, services, or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase commitments exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.\n(2) Acquisition-related contingent considerations represents the estimated fair value of future payments to the former shareholders of applicable acquired companies based on achieving annual revenue and gross margin targets in certain years as specified in the purchase and sale agreements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to: revenue recognition; stock-based compensation expense; restructuring and other related charges; income taxes, including the recoverability of deferred tax assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; inventory reductions for excess and obsolete inventories; estimated fair values of long-lived assets used to measure the recoverability of long-lived assets; intangible assets and goodwill; expected future cash flows used to measure the recoverability of intangible assets and long-lived assets; warranty costs; derivative financial instruments; and contingent liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, current market and economic conditions, industry trends, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most estimation and subjective judgment.\nRevenue recognition.\n2019 & 2018 Policy under ASC 606:\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The key elements of ASC 606 are: 1) identifying a contract with the customer; 2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determining the transaction price; 4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognizing revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe recognize revenue from systems sales upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. Transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment, or for certain systems, based upon customer acceptance for a system once delivered and installed at a customer facility. For systems that include customer-specific acceptance criteria, we are required to assess when it can demonstrate the acceptance criteria has been met, which generally is upon successful factory acceptance testing or customer acceptance and evidence of installation. For systems that require installation and where system revenue is recognized upon shipment, the standalone selling price of installation is deferred until customer acceptance.\nWhen products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner, we recognize the system sale upon transfer of control which is typically on shipment. When we are responsible for installation, the standalone selling price of installation is deferred until customer acceptance. Our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return; however, our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year.\nFor contracts that include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices of the goods and services being provided to the customer. Our best evidence of standalone selling price is its normal selling pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a standalone basis. Alternatively, we may determine standalone selling price using an expected cost plus a margin approach.\nWe analyze our selling prices used in the allocation of the transaction price, at a minimum, on an annual basis. Selling prices will be analyzed more frequently if a significant change in our business or other factors necessitate more frequent analysis or we experience significant variances in our selling prices.\nRevenue from accessories and parts is generally recognized based on shipment. Service revenue is recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the contractual obligation and includes maintenance contracts, extended warranties, training, application support and on-demand services.\nFor performance obligations recognized over time, revenue is measured by progress toward completion of the performance obligation that reflects the transfer of control. In particular, we have certain contracts recognized over time for which we apply the cost-to-cost method based on costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated costs for the contract upon completion. Application of the cost-to-cost method requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion and the total costs we will incur. Losses are recorded immediately when we estimate that contracts will ultimately result in a loss. Changes in the estimates could affect the timing of revenue recognition.\nWe include costs incurred in connection with shipping and handling of products within selling, general and administrative costs. Amounts billed to customers in connection with these costs are included in total revenues. When control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of our obligation to ship the products to our customers, we have elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. We exclude from the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority on revenue-producing transactions that are collected by us from a customer.\nWe require an advance deposit based on the terms and conditions of contracts with customers for many of our contracts. Typically, revenue is recognized within one year of receiving an advance deposit. We do not have any material payment terms that extend beyond one year. For contracts where an advance payment is received greater than one year from expected revenue recognition, or a portion of the payment due extends beyond one year, we determined it does not constitute a significant financing component. There is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our contracts.\nOther revenues are primarily comprised of development arrangements recognized on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis and licensing arrangements recognized either when the licenses are provided or ratably over the contract term depending on the nature of the arrangement.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets represent unbilled receivables when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and the right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. Contract assets typically result from system revenue recorded where a portion of the transaction price is not billable until a future event, such as customer acceptance, or from contracts recognized on a cost-to-cost or cost-plus-fixed-fee basis as revenue exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current.\nContract liabilities consist of customer advances, deferred revenue and billings in excess of revenue from contracts recognized on a cost-to-cost or cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. Contract liabilities are classified as current or long-term based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue. Contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\n2017 Policy under ASC 605:\nWe recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Title and risk of loss generally transfers upon shipment, or for certain systems, based upon customer acceptance for a system that has been delivered to the customer and installed at a customer\nfacility. For systems that include customer-specific acceptance criteria, we are required to assess when we can demonstrate the acceptance criteria has been met, which generally is upon successful factory acceptance testing or customer acceptance and evidence of installation.\nWhen products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner who assumes responsibility for installation, we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor. Our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return; however, our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year. Revenue is deferred until cash is received when collectability is not reasonably assured or when the price is not fixed or determinable.\nFor transactions that include multiple elements, arrangement consideration is allocated to each element using the fair value hierarchy as required by ASU No. 2009-13. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations, or subject to customer-specific return or refund privileges.\nWe determine the fair value of products and services based upon vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). We determine VSOE based on normal selling pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand-alone basis. In determining VSOE, our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range. We also consider the class of customer, method of distribution and the geographies into which products and services are being sold when determining VSOE.\nIf VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish the selling price based on third-party evidence (TPE). VSOE cannot be established in instances where a product or service has not been sold separately, stand-alone sales are too infrequent or product pricing is not within a sufficiently narrow range. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately.\nWhen we cannot determine VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (ESP) in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand-alone sale of the product or service. ESP is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies, internal costs and gross profit objectives, method of distribution, market research and information, recent technological trends, competitive landscape and geographies. We analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of arrangement consideration, at a minimum, on an annual basis. Selling prices will be analyzed more frequently if a significant change in our business occurs or other factors necessitate more frequent analysis, or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices.\nRevenue from accessories and consumable parts is generally recognized upon shipping terms. Service revenue is recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the contractual obligation and includes maintenance contracts, extended warranty, training, application support and on-demand services.\nWe also have contracts for which we apply the percentage-of-completion model and completed contract model of revenue recognition. Application of the percentage-of-completion method requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract and the total costs we will incur under the contract and losses are recorded immediately when we estimate that contracts will ultimately result in a loss. Changes in the estimates could affect the timing of revenue recognition.\nOther revenues are primarily comprised of development arrangements recognized on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis and licensing arrangements recognized ratably over the term of the related contracts.\nIncome taxes. The determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the annual effective tax rate, the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the forecasted profitability of our subsidiaries in certain geographic jurisdictions, as well as the deductions, carryforwards and credits that are available to reduce taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial statement and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are\nexpected to be settled. We estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and we provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a valuation allowance has been provided, we reverse the related valuation allowance. If our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of a valuation allowance may be necessary. In addition, we only recognize benefits for tax positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained upon review by a taxing authority with knowledge of all relevant information. We reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any changes to these positions as a result of tax audits, tax laws or other facts and circumstances could result in additional charges or credits to operations. The expiration of statutes of limitations affecting estimates made for uncertain tax positions can cause higher earnings.\nOn December 22, 2017 (Enactment Date), the President of the United States signed tax reform legislation (2017 Tax Act), which enacted a wide range of changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, many of which differ significantly from the provisions of the previous U.S. tax law. We have completed the assessment of the tax effects associated with the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. Changes in the tax rates and laws are accounted for in the period of enactment.\nInventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with costs determined by the first-in, first-out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for certain other subsidiaries. We record provisions to account for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected non-saleable or non-refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products or products no longer offered for sale. Inventories also include demonstration units located in our demonstration laboratories or installed at the sites of potential customers. We consider our demonstration units to be available for sale and have a history of selling these demonstration units. We reduce the carrying value of demonstration inventories for differences between cost and estimated net realizable value, taking into consideration usage in the preceding twelve months, expected demand, technological obsolescence and other information including the physical condition of the unit. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional write-downs may be required, resulting in additional charges to operations.\nGoodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets. We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Under U.S. GAAP, we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing a two-step quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment requires significant judgments about macro-economic conditions including the entity's operating environment; its industry and other market considerations; entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel; and other events that could impact the reporting unit. If, as a result of our qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. If a quantitative impairment test is performed, the first step involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of both the market approach and the income approach methodologies. The income approach valuation methodology includes discounted cash flow estimates. Estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgment about the future cash flows. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. At December 31, 2019, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation using a qualitative and quantitative impairment test and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment was required.\nWe also review definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets when indications of potential impairment exist. Should the fair value of our long-lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines or other indicators of an impairment, a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, at the date of each acquisition, we measure the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed and any remaining noncontrolling interests and allocates the amounts paid to all items measured. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired are based on valuations that use information and assumptions determined by management and which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this document and should be considered an integral part of this Item 7.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, describes the principal factors affecting the results of our operations, financial condition and changes in financial condition, as well as our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our MD&A is organized as follows:\n \u25cf Safe-harbor and Non-GAAP Clarification. This section provides appropriate disclosures regarding forward looking statements and our use of Non-GAAP financial measures. \n \u25cf Overview. This section provides a brief discussion of our reportable segments' results of operations, significant recent developments in our businesses, and challenges and risks that may impact our businesses in the future. \n \u25cf Results of Operations. This section provides our analysis of the significant line items on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides an analysis of our liquidity and cash flow and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments. \n \u25cf Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. This section discusses the accounting estimates that are considered important to our financial condition and results of operations and require us to exercise subjective or complex judgments in their application. All of our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n \u25cf Recent Accounting Pronouncements. This section provides a summary of recent accounting pronouncements and discusses their potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. \nNON-GAAP CLARIFICATION\nAlthough our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), we believe describing revenue and expenses, excluding the effects of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, as well as certain other charges, net, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Specifically, management believes that organic revenue and free cash flow, both non-GAAP financial measures, as well as non-GAAP gross profit margin and non-GAAP operating margin, provide relevant and useful information that is widely used by equity analysts, investors and competitors in our industry, as well as by our management, in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance. We define the term organic revenue as GAAP revenue excluding the effect of foreign currency translation changes and the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. We define the term non-GAAP gross profit margin as GAAP gross profit margin with certain non-GAAP measures excluded and non-GAAP operating margin as GAAP operating margin with certain non-GAAP measures excluded. These non-GAAP measures exclude costs related to restructuring actions, acquisition and related integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, costs associated with our global information technology transition initiative, and other non-operational costs that are infrequent or non-recurring in nature and we believe these are useful measures to evaluate our continuing business.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business as it indicates the amount of cash generated after additions to property, plant, and equipment which is available for, among other things, investments in our business, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and repayment of debt. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because our management believes they provide more comparable measures of our continuing business because they adjust for\ncertain items that are not reflective of the underlying performance of our business. These measures may also be useful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. We regularly use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business results and make operating decisions. We also measure our employees and compensate them, in part, based on such non-GAAP measures and use this information for our planning and forecasting activities. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable among companies.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-performance scientific instruments and analytical and diagnostic solutions that enable our customers to explore life and materials at microscopic, molecular and cellular levels. Our corporate headquarters are located in Billerica, Massachusetts. We maintain major technical and manufacturing centers in Europe and North America, and we have sales offices located throughout the world. Bruker is organized into three reportable segments: the BSI Life Science Segment (comprised of the Bruker BioSpin Group and the Bruker CALID Group), the BSI NANO Segment and the Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST) Segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue increased by $177.0 million, or 9.3%, to $2,072.6 million, compared to $1,895.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in revenue were increases of approximately $118.4 million attributable to our recent acquisitions and a decrease of approximately $50.3 million from the impact of foreign currency translation in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $108.9 million, or 5.7%.\nOur gross profit margin increased to 48.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 47.5% during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit margin resulted primarily from operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOur operating margin increased to 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 13.8% during the year ended December 31, 2018. Our operating margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to volume and operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by continued investments in our strategic growth areas.\nThe income tax provision in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $82.4 million and $63.7 million, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 29.4% and 26.0%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily attributable to a benefit recorded in 2018 associated with the reversal of state and foreign withholding taxes on unremitted earnings that did not recur in 2019 and additional tax reserves for uncertain tax positions in Europe in 2019. Our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of jurisdictional income changes. Earnings per share increased to $1.26 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.14 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase compared to the prior year was driven primarily by revenue growth, higher gross and operating profit offset by an increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a source of cash of $213.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, was $140.4 million, calculated as follows:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our free cash flow was 26% lower than for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily attributable to higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash items were more than offset by an increase in capital expenditures and the timing of inventory purchases.\nOn December 11, 2019, we entered into (1) a new revolving credit agreement to establish a new revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $600 million; (2) a term loan agreement to establish a new term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million; and (3) a note purchase agreement to issue and sell CHF 297 million aggregate principal amount of 1.01% senior notes due December 11, 2029. Floating interest rates under the term loan were simultaneously fixed through cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements into Euro ($150 million) and Swiss Franc ($150 million) rates carrying average effective interest rates of 0.94% and hedge our net investment in our Euro and Swiss Franc denominated net assets. The new revolving credit agreement replaced our $500 million five-year revolving credit agreement established on October 27, 2015, that was terminated on December 11, 2019. In addition, we designated our CHF 297 million senior notes as a hedge in our net investment in our Swiss Franc denominated net assets. Proceeds from this financing were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under our prior 2015 revolving credit facility and we intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes and to support corporate strategic objectives. During December 2019, we entered into U.S. Dollar to Euro cross-currency swaps on our existing 2012 private placement notes of $105 million 4.31% Series 2012A Senior Notes, Tranche C, due January 18, 2022, and the existing $100 million 4.46% Series 2012A Senior Notes, Tranche D, due January 18, 2024, resulting in an average effective interest rate of 2.25% on these instruments. The cross-currency swaps hedge our net investment in our Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these interest rate and cross currency swap agreements, we reduced our interest expense by $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. We anticipate these swap agreements will lower net interest expense in future years.\nOn February 22, 2016, we announced the establishment of a dividend policy and the declaration by our Board of Directors of an initial quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share of our issued and outstanding common stock. Dividends amounting to $25.0 million and $25.1 million were paid during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Future dividend payments, if any, are subject to approval of our Board of Directors. We are targeting a cash dividend to our shareholders in the amount of $0.16 per share per annum, payable in equal quarterly installments.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we completed various acquisitions that complemented our existing market offerings and added aftermarket and software capabilities. The impact of the acquired companies on revenues, net income and total assets was not material.\nWe can experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of various factors, some of which are outside our control, such as:\n \u25cf the timing of governmental stimulus programs and academic research budgets; \n \u25cf the time it takes between the date customer orders and deposits are received, systems are shipped and accepted by our customers and full payment is received; \n \u25cf foreign currency exchange rates; \n \u25cf the time it takes for us to receive critical materials to manufacture our products; \n \u25cf general economic conditions; \n \u25cf the time it takes to satisfy local customs requirements and other export/import requirements; \n \u25cf the time it takes for customers to construct or prepare their facilities for our products; and \n \u25cf the time required to obtain governmental licenses. \nThese factors have in the past affected the amount and timing of revenue recognized on sales of our products and receipt of related payments and will continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not necessarily be an indication of any future quarter's operating performance.\nAs previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 18, 2020, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee) initiated an internal investigation into an allegation recently received in connection with our year-end close, primarily relating to income tax matters including the effective income tax rate for 2019 and the related income tax balance sheet accounts. The Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent, experienced external legal counsel, and independent forensic accountants, concluded its investigation in March 2020. The Investigation did not identify any material misstatements or omissions regarding our financial statements, misconduct, violations of our Code of Conduct, or tone at the top failures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table presents our results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions, except per share data):\n\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue increased by $177.0 million, or 9.3%, to $2,072.6 million, compared to $1,895.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our revenues included $118.4 million attributable to our recent acquisitions and a decrease of approximately $50.3 million from the impact of foreign currency translation in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $108.9 million, or 5.7%.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $995.3 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 48.0%, compared to $900.0 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 47.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $41.7 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP gross profit margin was 50.0% and 49.0% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $500.2 million, or 24.1% of revenue, from $444.7 million, or 23.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily caused by the addition of recent acquisitions and select investments in strategic growth areas, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $187.7 million, or 9.1% of revenue, from $173.4 million, or 9.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The dollar increase was driven primarily by the addition of recent acquisitions, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOther Charges, Net\nOther charges, net was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The charges consisted primarily of $(3.9) million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $4.6 million of acquisition-related charges related to acquisitions completed in 2019 and 2018, $3.7 million of costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative, and $2.1 million related to professional fees. The restructuring charges included a gain on the sale of a building of $7.7 million.\nOther charges, net was $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The charges consisted primarily of $6.8 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.4 million of acquisition-related charges related to acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017, $4.8 million of costs associated with our global information technology (IT) transformation initiative and $4.5 million related to professional fees.\nIn 2020, we expect to incur $10.0 to $15.0 million of expense related to various outsourcing initiatives and other restructuring activities that were implemented in 2019 or will commence in 2020.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment is required.\nWe will continue to monitor goodwill and long-lived intangible assets, as well as long-lived tangible assets, for possible future impairment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $300.9 million, resulting in an operating margin of 14.5%, compared to operating income of $262.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in operating income were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $63.1 million and $55.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was were 17.6% and 16.8% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin was due primarily to volume and operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2019 was ($20.5) million, compared to ($17.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net interest expense in 2019 was primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt balances in 2019 compared to 2018 being marginally offset by interest income from the new 2019 U.S. Dollar-to-Euro and U.S. Dollar to Swiss Franc interest rate cross-currency swap agreements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $14.7 million, realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $3.3 million, and $2.5 million related to pension plan expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $11.4 million, realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $3.0 million, and $3.9 million related to pension plan expenses.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe income tax provision in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $82.4 million and $63.7 million, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 29.4% and 26.0%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily attributable to a benefit recorded in 2018 associated with the reversal of state and foreign withholding taxes on unremitted earnings that did not recur in 2019 and additional tax reserves for uncertain tax positions in Europe in 2019. Our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of jurisdictional income changes.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $0.8 million compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest represented the minority shareholders' proportionate share of the net income recorded by our majority-owned indirect subsidiaries.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $197.2 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to net income of $179.7 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, for 2018. The increase compared to the prior year was driven primarily by revenue growth, higher gross and operating profit offset by an increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSegment Results\nRevenue\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue, and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\n\n (a) Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments. \nFor financial reporting purposes, we aggregate Bruker BioSpin Group and Bruker CALID Group as the BSI Life Science Segment. This aggregation reflects the similar economic characteristics, production processes, customer services provided, types and classes of customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environments.\nBSI Life Science Segment revenue increased by $106.0 million to $1,244.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,138.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Bruker BioSpin Group revenue increase was primarily due to growth in the system revenue, which included the revenue recognition of three GHz class systems, as well as aftermarket revenue and a small contribution from recent software acquisitions. The increase in Bruker CALID Group revenue was a result of continued strong demand for life science mass spectrometry and microbiology products, growth in molecular spectroscopy FT-IR and NIR products and contributions from an acquisition.\nBSI NANO Segment revenue increased by $64.6 million to $632.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $568.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The revenue increase was primarily the result of acquisitions as well as continued demand for advanced X-Ray and nano analysis products, partially offset by a sharp decline in demand for semiconductor metrology products and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nBEST Segment revenue increased by $15.1 million to $209.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $194.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenue resulted primarily from shipments of superconductors for healthcare applications offset in part by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nOperating Income\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\n\n (a) Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments. \nThe operating margin expansion for BSI Life Science and BEST was primarily due to positive operating leverage on higher sales mix and operational improvements as well as favorable foreign currency translation for the BSI Life Science Segment. The decline in operating margin for BSI NANO Segment was due to a decline in semiconductor metrology demand, softness in industrial research markets in the second half of 2019 and the impact of costs related to a recent acquisition.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table presents our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions, except per share data):\n\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenue increased by $129.7 million, or 7.3%, to $1,895.6 million, compared to $1,765.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Included in revenue were an increase of approximately $28.2 million attributable to our recent acquisitions and an increase of approximately $25.5 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus\nthe Euro and other currencies. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $76.0 million, or 4.3%.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $900.0 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 47.5%, compared to $816.0 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 46.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $28.7 million and $36.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP gross profit margins were 49.0% and 48.3% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to positive operating leverage on higher sales volume and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $444.7 million, or 23.5% of revenue, from $415.2 million, or 23.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily caused by the effect of recent acquisitions.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, describes the principal factors affecting the results of our operations, financial condition and changes in financial condition, as well as our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our MD&A is organized as follows:\n \u25cf Safe-harbor and Non-GAAP Clarification. This section provides appropriate disclosures regarding forward looking statements and our use of Non-GAAP financial measures. \n \u25cf Overview. This section provides a brief discussion of our reportable segments' results of operations, significant recent developments in our businesses, and challenges and risks that may impact our businesses in the future. \n \u25cf Results of Operations. This section provides our analysis of the significant line items on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides an analysis of our liquidity and cash flow and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments. \n \u25cf Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. This section discusses the accounting estimates that are considered important to our financial condition and results of operations and require us to exercise subjective or complex judgments in their application. All of our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n \u25cf Recent Accounting Pronouncements. This section provides a summary of recent accounting pronouncements and discusses their potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. \nNON-GAAP CLARIFICATION\nAlthough our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), we believe describing revenue and expenses, excluding the effects of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, as well as certain other charges, net, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Specifically, management believes that organic revenue and free cash flow, both non-GAAP financial measures, as well as non-GAAP gross profit margin and non-GAAP operating margin, provide relevant and useful information that is widely used by equity analysts, investors and competitors in our industry, as well as by our management, in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance. We define the term organic revenue as GAAP revenue excluding the effect of foreign currency translation changes and the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. We define the term non-GAAP gross profit margin as GAAP gross profit margin with certain non-GAAP measures excluded and non-GAAP operating margin as GAAP operating margin with certain non-GAAP measures excluded. These non-GAAP measures exclude costs related to restructuring actions, acquisition and related integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, costs associated with our global information technology transition initiative, and other non-operational costs that are infrequent or non-recurring in nature and we believe these are useful measures to evaluate our continuing business.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business as it indicates the amount of cash generated after additions to property, plant, and equipment which is available for, among other things, investments in our business, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and repayment of debt. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because our management believes they provide more comparable measures of our continuing business because they adjust for\ncertain items that are not reflective of the underlying performance of our business. These measures may also be useful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. We regularly use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business results and make operating decisions. We also measure our employees and compensate them, in part, based on such non-GAAP measures and use this information for our planning and forecasting activities. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable among companies.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-performance scientific instruments and analytical and diagnostic solutions that enable our customers to explore life and materials at microscopic, molecular and cellular levels. Our corporate headquarters are located in Billerica, Massachusetts. We maintain major technical and manufacturing centers in Europe and North America, and we have sales offices located throughout the world. Bruker is organized into three reportable segments: the BSI Life Science Segment (comprised of the Bruker BioSpin Group and the Bruker CALID Group), the BSI NANO Segment and the Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST) Segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue increased by $177.0 million, or 9.3%, to $2,072.6 million, compared to $1,895.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in revenue were increases of approximately $118.4 million attributable to our recent acquisitions and a decrease of approximately $50.3 million from the impact of foreign currency translation in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $108.9 million, or 5.7%.\nOur gross profit margin increased to 48.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 47.5% during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit margin resulted primarily from operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOur operating margin increased to 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 13.8% during the year ended December 31, 2018. Our operating margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to volume and operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by continued investments in our strategic growth areas.\nThe income tax provision in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $82.4 million and $63.7 million, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 29.4% and 26.0%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily attributable to a benefit recorded in 2018 associated with the reversal of state and foreign withholding taxes on unremitted earnings that did not recur in 2019 and additional tax reserves for uncertain tax positions in Europe in 2019. Our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of jurisdictional income changes. Earnings per share increased to $1.26 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.14 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase compared to the prior year was driven primarily by revenue growth, higher gross and operating profit offset by an increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a source of cash of $213.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, was $140.4 million, calculated as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 213.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 239.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 154.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 140.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 190.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 110.7\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our free cash flow was 26% lower than for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily attributable to higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash items were more than offset by an increase in capital expenditures and the timing of inventory purchases.\nOn December 11, 2019, we entered into (1) a new revolving credit agreement to establish a new revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $600 million; (2) a term loan agreement to establish a new term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million; and (3) a note purchase agreement to issue and sell CHF 297 million aggregate principal amount of 1.01% senior notes due December 11, 2029. Floating interest rates under the term loan were simultaneously fixed through cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements into Euro ($150 million) and Swiss Franc ($150 million) rates carrying average effective interest rates of 0.94% and hedge our net investment in our Euro and Swiss Franc denominated net assets. The new revolving credit agreement replaced our $500 million five-year revolving credit agreement established on October 27, 2015, that was terminated on December 11, 2019. In addition, we designated our CHF 297 million senior notes as a hedge in our net investment in our Swiss Franc denominated net assets. Proceeds from this financing were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under our prior 2015 revolving credit facility and we intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes and to support corporate strategic objectives. During December 2019, we entered into U.S. Dollar to Euro cross-currency swaps on our existing 2012 private placement notes of $105 million 4.31% Series 2012A Senior Notes, Tranche C, due January 18, 2022, and the existing $100 million 4.46% Series 2012A Senior Notes, Tranche D, due January 18, 2024, resulting in an average effective interest rate of 2.25% on these instruments. The cross-currency swaps hedge our net investment in our Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these interest rate and cross currency swap agreements, we reduced our interest expense by $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. We anticipate these swap agreements will lower net interest expense in future years.\nOn February 22, 2016, we announced the establishment of a dividend policy and the declaration by our Board of Directors of an initial quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share of our issued and outstanding common stock. Dividends amounting to $25.0 million and $25.1 million were paid during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Future dividend payments, if any, are subject to approval of our Board of Directors. We are targeting a cash dividend to our shareholders in the amount of $0.16 per share per annum, payable in equal quarterly installments.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we completed various acquisitions that complemented our existing market offerings and added aftermarket and software capabilities. The impact of the acquired companies on revenues, net income and total assets was not material.\nWe can experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of various factors, some of which are outside our control, such as:\n \u25cf the timing of governmental stimulus programs and academic research budgets; \n \u25cf the time it takes between the date customer orders and deposits are received, systems are shipped and accepted by our customers and full payment is received; \n \u25cf foreign currency exchange rates; \n \u25cf the time it takes for us to receive critical materials to manufacture our products; \n \u25cf general economic conditions; \n \u25cf the time it takes to satisfy local customs requirements and other export/import requirements; \n \u25cf the time it takes for customers to construct or prepare their facilities for our products; and \n \u25cf the time required to obtain governmental licenses. \nThese factors have in the past affected the amount and timing of revenue recognized on sales of our products and receipt of related payments and will continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not necessarily be an indication of any future quarter's operating performance.\nAs previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 18, 2020, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee) initiated an internal investigation into an allegation recently received in connection with our year-end close, primarily relating to income tax matters including the effective income tax rate for 2019 and the related income tax balance sheet accounts. The Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent, experienced external legal counsel, and independent forensic accountants, concluded its investigation in March 2020. The Investigation did not identify any material misstatements or omissions regarding our financial statements, misconduct, violations of our Code of Conduct, or tone at the top failures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table presents our results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions, except per share data):\nTable 120: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,744.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,576.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 322.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 311.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,072.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,895.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 878.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 801.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of service revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 193.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,077.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 995.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 995.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 900.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 444.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 187.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other charges, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 694.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 637.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 280.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 244.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Bruker Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 197.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 179.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per common share attributable to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bruker Corporation shareholders:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.15\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.14\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 155.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 156.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 156.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157.2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue increased by $177.0 million, or 9.3%, to $2,072.6 million, compared to $1,895.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our revenues included $118.4 million attributable to our recent acquisitions and a decrease of approximately $50.3 million from the impact of foreign currency translation in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and our recent acquisitions, our organic revenue, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $108.9 million, or 5.7%.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $995.3 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 48.0%, compared to $900.0 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 47.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in gross profit were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $41.7 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP gross profit margin was 50.0% and 49.0% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit margin increased in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $500.2 million, or 24.1% of revenue, from $444.7 million, or 23.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily caused by the addition of recent acquisitions and select investments in strategic growth areas, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $187.7 million, or 9.1% of revenue, from $173.4 million, or 9.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The dollar increase was driven primarily by the addition of recent acquisitions, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects.\nOther Charges, Net\nOther charges, net was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The charges consisted primarily of $(3.9) million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $4.6 million of acquisition-related charges related to acquisitions completed in 2019 and 2018, $3.7 million of costs associated with our global IT transformation initiative, and $2.1 million related to professional fees. The restructuring charges included a gain on the sale of a building of $7.7 million.\nOther charges, net was $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The charges consisted primarily of $6.8 million of restructuring costs related to closing facilities and implementing outsourcing and other restructuring initiatives, $3.4 million of acquisition-related charges related to acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017, $4.8 million of costs associated with our global information technology (IT) transformation initiative and $4.5 million related to professional fees.\nIn 2020, we expect to incur $10.0 to $15.0 million of expense related to various outsourcing initiatives and other restructuring activities that were implemented in 2019 or will commence in 2020.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment evaluation and concluded the fair values of each of our reporting units were significantly greater than their carrying amounts, and therefore, no additional impairment is required.\nWe will continue to monitor goodwill and long-lived intangible assets, as well as long-lived tangible assets, for possible future impairment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $300.9 million, resulting in an operating margin of 14.5%, compared to operating income of $262.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Included in operating income were various charges for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs totaling $63.1 million and $55.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was were 17.6% and 16.8% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin was due primarily to volume and operational improvements within our BSI Life Science Segment, accretive acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2019 was ($20.5) million, compared to ($17.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net interest expense in 2019 was primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt balances in 2019 compared to 2018 being marginally offset by interest income from the new 2019 U.S. Dollar-to-Euro and U.S. Dollar to Swiss Franc interest rate cross-currency swap agreements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $14.7 million, realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $3.3 million, and $2.5 million related to pension plan expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the major components within interest and other income (expense), net were net interest expense of $11.4 million, realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of $3.0 million, and $3.9 million related to pension plan expenses.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe income tax provision in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $82.4 million and $63.7 million, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 29.4% and 26.0%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily attributable to a benefit recorded in 2018 associated with the reversal of state and foreign withholding taxes on unremitted earnings that did not recur in 2019 and additional tax reserves for uncertain tax positions in Europe in 2019. Our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of jurisdictional income changes.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $0.8 million compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest represented the minority shareholders' proportionate share of the net income recorded by our majority-owned indirect subsidiaries.\nNet Income Attributable to Bruker Corporation\nOur net income attributable to Bruker Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $197.2 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to net income of $179.7 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, for 2018. The increase compared to the prior year was driven primarily by revenue growth, higher gross and operating profit offset by an increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSegment Results\nRevenue\nThe following table presents revenue, change in revenue, and revenue growth by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\nTable 121: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI Life Science\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,244.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,138.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 106.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI Nano\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 632.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 568.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BEST\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,072.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,895.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 177.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Represents product and service revenue between reportable segments. \nFor financial reporting purposes, we aggregate Bruker BioSpin Group and Bruker CALID Group as the BSI Life Science Segment. This aggregation reflects the similar economic characteristics, production processes, customer services provided, types and classes of customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environments.\nBSI Life Science Segment revenue increased by $106.0 million to $1,244.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,138.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Bruker BioSpin Group revenue increase was primarily due to growth in the system revenue, which included the revenue recognition of three GHz class systems, as well as aftermarket revenue and a small contribution from recent software acquisitions. The increase in Bruker CALID Group revenue was a result of continued strong demand for life science mass spectrometry and microbiology products, growth in molecular spectroscopy FT-IR and NIR products and contributions from an acquisition.\nBSI NANO Segment revenue increased by $64.6 million to $632.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $568.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The revenue increase was primarily the result of acquisitions as well as continued demand for advanced X-Ray and nano analysis products, partially offset by a sharp decline in demand for semiconductor metrology products and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nBEST Segment revenue increased by $15.1 million to $209.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $194.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenue resulted primarily from shipments of superconductors for healthcare applications offset in part by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nOperating Income\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margins on revenue by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\nTable 123: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI Life Science\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 290.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 244.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BSI NANO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BEST\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate, eliminations and other (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46.2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44.5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 300.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 262.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Represents corporate costs and eliminations not allocated to the reportable segments. \nThe operating margin expansion for BSI Life Science and BEST was primarily due to positive operating leverage on higher sales mix and operational improvements as well as favorable foreign currency translation for the BSI Life Science Segment. The decline in operating margin for BSI NANO Segment was due to a decline in semiconductor metrology demand, softness in industrial research markets in the second half of 2019 and the impact of costs related to a recent acquisition.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table presents our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions, except per share data):\nTable 125: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,576.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,479.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 311.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 278.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,895.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,765.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 801.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 787.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of service revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 193.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 995.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 949.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 900.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 816.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 444.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 415.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 161.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other charges, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 637.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 596.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 219.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17.7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21.7)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 244.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Bruker Corporation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 179.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 78.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per common share attributable to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bruker Corporation shareholders:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0.50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0.49\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares outstanding:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 156.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 158.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 159.1\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenue increased by $129.7 million, or 7.3%, to $1,895.6 million, compared to $1,765.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Included in revenue were an increase of approximately $28.2 million attributable to our recent acquisitions and an increase of approximately $25.5 million from the impact of foreign currency translation caused by the weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus\nthe Euro and other currencies.
