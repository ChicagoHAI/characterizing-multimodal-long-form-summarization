MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\"MD&A\")\nThe following discussion of financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and certain factors that may affect future results, including economic and industry-wide factors, should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included herein. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law and regulations, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other statements we may make in the following discussion or elsewhere in this document even though these statements may be affected by events or circumstances occurring after the forward-looking statements or other statements were made. Please see the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe are a growth-oriented, technology-enabled, highly-diversified consumer finance company serving a wide range of underbanked consumers in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and are a market leader in our industry based on revenues. We believe that we have the only true omni-channel customer acquisition, onboarding and servicing platform in our industry that is integrated across store, online, mobile and contact center touchpoints. Our IT platform, which we refer to as the Curo Platform,\u201d seamlessly integrates loan underwriting, scoring, servicing, collections, regulatory compliance and reporting activities into a single, centralized system. We use advanced risk analytics powered by proprietary algorithms and over 15 years of loan performance data to efficiently and effectively score our customers' loan applications. Since 2010, we have extended $14.5 billion in total credit across approximately 38.1 million total loans, and our revenue of $963.6 million in 2017 represents a 24.8% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, over the same time period.\nWe operate in the United States under two principal brands, Speedy Cash\u201d and Rapid Cash,\u201d and launched our new brand Avio Credit\u201d in the United States in the second quarter of 2017. In the United Kingdom we operate online as Wage Day Advance\u201d and \"Juo Loans\" and, prior to their closure in the third quarter of 2017, our stores were branded Speedy Cash.\u201d In Canada, our stores are branded Cash Money\u201d and we offer LendDirect\u201d installment loans online. As of December 31, 2017, our store network consisted of 407 locations across 14 U.S. states and seven Canadian provinces. As of December 31, 2017, we offered our online services in 27 U.S. states, five Canadian provinces, and the United Kingdom.\nRecent Developments\nWe completed our initial public offering (\"IPO\") of 6,666,667 shares of common stock on December 11, 2017, at a price of $14.00 per share, which provided net proceeds of $81.1 million. In connection with the closing, the underwriters had a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,000,000 shares at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discount to over-allotments, which they exercised on January 5, 2018, which provided additional net proceeds of $13.0 million.\nOn February 5, 2018 CURO Financial Technologies Corp. ( CFTC\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued a notice of redemption for $77.5 million of its 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the Notes,\u201d and the transaction whereby the Notes are partially redeemed, the Redemption\u201d) that were issued by CFTC. The redemption was completed on March 7, 2018. The redemption price was equal to 112.00% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest paid thereon, to the date of redemption. Following the Redemption, $527.5 million of the original outstanding principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding. The Redemption was conducted pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes (the Indenture\u201d), dated as of February 15, 2017, by and among CFTC, the guarantors party thereto and TMI Trust Company, as trustee and collateral agent. Consistent with the terms of the Indenture, CFTC used a portion of the cash proceeds from the Company's initial public offering, completed on December 11, 2017, to redeem such Notes.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe offer a variety of loan products including Installment, Open-End and Single-Pay Loans. Revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income includes: interest income, finance charges, CSO fees, late fees and non-sufficient funds fees as permitted by applicable laws and pursuant to the agreement with the customer. Product offerings differ by jurisdiction and are governed by the laws in each separate jurisdiction.\nInstallment Loans are fully amortizing loans with a fixed payment amount due each period during the term of the loan. We record revenue from Installment Loans on a simple-interest basis. Accrued interest and fees are included in gross loans receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOpen-End Loans are a revolving line-of-credit with no defined loan term. We record revenue from Open-End Loans on a simple-interest basis. Accrued interest and fees are included in gross loans receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSingle-Pay Loans are primarily payday loans. Revenues from Single-Pay loan products are recognized each period on a constant-yield basis ratably over the term of each loan. We defer recognition of unearned fees based on the remaining term of the loan at the end of each reporting period.\nWe also provide a number of ancillary financial products including check cashing, proprietary reloadable prepaid debit cards (Opt+), money transfer services, gold buying, credit protection insurance in the Canadian market, and retail installment sales.\nProvision for Losses\nWe calculate provision for losses based on evaluation of the historical and expected cumulative net losses inherent in the underlying loan portfolios, by vintage, and several other quantitative and qualitative factors. We apply the resulting loss provision rate to our loan originations to determine the provision for losses. Accordingly, at the time we originate a loan, we recognize a loss on a portion of the loan balance based upon the applicable loss provision rate. We would then recognize any revenue in connection with that loan over the life of the loan, as described above. We may also record additional provision for losses for owned loans in connection with the periodic assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nQ1 2017 Loss Recognition Change\nEffective January 1, 2017, we modified the timeframe in which Installment Loans are charged-off and made related refinements to our loss provisioning methodology. Prior to January 1, 2017, we deemed all loans uncollectible and charged-off when a customer missed a scheduled payment and the loan was considered past-due. Because of our continuing shift from Single-Pay to Installment Loan products and our analysis of payment\npatterns on early-stage versus late-stage delinquencies, we revised our estimates and now consider Installment Loans uncollectible when the loan has been contractually past-due for 90 consecutive days. Consequently, past-due Installment Loans and related accrued interest remain in loans receivable, with disclosure of past-due balances, for 90 days before being charged off against the allowance for loan losses. All recoveries on charged-off loans are credited to the allowance for loan losses. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses compared to the related gross loans receivable balances that include accrued interest.\nIn the income statement, the provision for losses for Installment Loans is based on assessment of the cumulative net losses inherent in the underlying loan portfolios, by vintage, and several other quantitative and qualitative factors. The resulting loss provision rate is applied to loan originations to determine the provision for losses. In addition to improving estimated collectability and loss recognition for Installment Loans, we also believe these refinements result in a loss provisioning methodology that is better aligned with industry comparisons and practices.\nThe aforementioned change was treated as a change in accounting estimate for accounting purposes and applied prospectively beginning January 1, 2017, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as the Q1 Loss Recognition Change.\nThe change affects comparability to prior periods as follows:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gross Combined Loans Receivable-balances in 2017 include Installment Loans that are up to 90 days past-due with related accrued interest, while balances in prior periods do not include these loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenues-for the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues include accrued interest on past-due loan balances, while revenues in prior periods do not include these amounts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Provision for Losses-prospectively, loans charged off on day 91 include accrued interest. Thus, provision rates in 2017 have been adjusted to include both principal and accrued interest. Additionally, because loss provision rates are applied to originations while charge-offs and recoveries are applied to the allowance for loan losses, provisioning is less affected by seasonality for the first quarter income tax refunds in the United States, which increases recoveries of delinquent balances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a full discussion of the change, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report.\nHurricane Harvey Impact\nIn a good-faith effort to help our store and online customers in the affected areas of Houston, Corpus Christi and the surrounding areas we waived loan payments that were due during the period from August 25, 2017 to September 8, 2017. This affected approximately 22,500 customers and amounted to approximately $3.0 million in total loan payments. The waived payments and losses on secured installment loans in the market increased our provision for losses by approximately $3.3 million. Property damage to our 18 stores in the affected areas was not material. Our stores in the Texas markets resumed normal operations in September.\nCost of Providing Services\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits include personnel-related costs for our store operations, including salaries, benefits and bonuses and are driven by the number of employees.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy and equipment includes rent expense for our leased facilities, as well as depreciation, maintenance, insurance, and utility expense.\nOffice\nOffice includes expenses related to software, computer hardware, bank service charges, credit scoring charges and other office supplies.\nOther Costs of Providing Services\nOur other costs of providing services includes expenses related to operations such as processing fees, collections expense, security expense, taxes, repairs and professional fees.\nAdvertising\nAll advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising includes costs associated with attracting, retaining and/or reactivating customers as well as creating awareness for the brands we promote. Creative, web and print design capabilities exist within the Company and are rarely outsourced. The use of third-party agencies is limited to mass-media production and placement. Advertising expense also includes costs for all marketing activities including paid search, advertising on social networking sites, affiliate programs, direct response television, radio air time and direct mail.\nOperating Expense\nCorporate, District and Other Expenses\nCorporate, district and other expenses include costs such as salaries and benefits associated with our corporate and district-level employees, as well as other corporate-related costs such as rent, insurance, professional fees, utilities, travel and entertainment expenses and depreciation expense.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily includes interest related to our Notes and our SPV Facility.\nOther Expenses\nOther (income) and expense includes the foreign currency impact to our intercompany balances, gains or losses on foreign currency exchanges and disposals of fixed assets and other miscellaneous income and expense amounts.\nDiscussion of Revenue by Product and Segment and Related Loan Portfolio Performance\nRevenue by Product\nUnsecured and Secured Installment revenue includes interest income, CSO fees, and non-sufficient funds or returned-items fees on late or defaulted payments on past-due loans (to which we refer collectively as late fees\u201d). Late fees comprise less than one-half of one percent of Installment revenues.\nOpen-End revenues include interest income on outstanding revolving balances and other usage or maintenance fees as permitted by underlying statutes.\nSingle-Pay revenues represent deferred presentment or other fees as defined by the underlying state, provincial or national regulations.\nThe following table summarizes revenue by product, including CSO fees, for 2017 and 2016:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>Canada\n</td> <td>U.K.\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>Canada\n</td> <td>U.K.\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Installment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>318,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Installment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open-End\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-Pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ancillary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>737,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>963,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>606,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>828,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor full year 2017, total lending revenue (excluding revenues from ancillary products) grew $131.1 million, or 16.5%, to $923.5 million, compared to the prior year period. Growth was driven predominantly by Unsecured and Secured Installment loan revenue. Unsecured installment loan revenues rose 45.2% on related origination increase of 46.4%. Secured installment revenues increased 24.0% on related origination increase of 33.2%. Single-Pay revenues were affected primarily by regulatory changes in Canada (rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia and product changes in Alberta). U.S. and U.K. Single-Pay revenues also decreased 8.6% and 37.8%, respectively, because of continued mix shift from Single-Pay to Installment and Open-End products. Ancillary revenues increased 10.8% versus the same period a year ago primarily due to insurance revenue in Canada, partially offset by a decrease in check cashing fees. U.K. revenue increased $5.8 million, or 17.1% ($7.8 million or 23.0%, on a constant currency basis).\nThe following table summarizes revenue by product for 2016 and 2015:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>Canada\n</td> <td>U.K.\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>Canada\n</td> <td>U.K.\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Installment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>318,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Installment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open-End\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-Pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ancillary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>606,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>828,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>573,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>813,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal lending revenue (excluding revenues from ancillary products) grew $18.8 million, or 2.4%, compared to the prior year, driven by growth in Installment and Open-End Loans. Unsecured Installment revenues rose 5.2% on related gross combined loan receivables growth of 29.0%, led by 7.9% growth in the United States (primarily in Texas, California and Missouri). U.K. Unsecured Installment revenues declined 41.7% because we discontinued a longer-term Installment Loan product in late 2015 due to regulatory changes. Secured Installment revenues decreased 5.6% mostly driven by competitive pressures in Nevada and Arizona. Open-End revenues grew 30.5% year-over-year primarily because in Kansas and Tennessee we replaced Single-pay products with Open-End products. Single-Pay revenues declined 2.6%. In the United States, the decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned changes in Kansas and Tennessee. Ancillary revenues were down 8.4% year-over-year primarily because secular declines in check usage continue to affect check-cashing revenues and we experienced tighter margins on foreign currency exchange. U.K. revenue comparisons are also affected meaningfully by a weaker pound. On a constant-currency basis, U.K. revenue declined $16.5 million, or 30.2%, compared to the prior year.\nLoan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis\nThe following table summarizes Company-owned gross loans receivable, a GAAP balance sheet measure, and reconciles it to gross combined loans receivable, a non-GAAP measure including loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in the consolidated financial statements but from which we earn revenue and for which we provide a guarantee to the lender:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company-owned gross loans receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross loans receivable guaranteed by the Company\n</td> <td>78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross combined loans receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>511.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>464.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>303.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents gross combined loans receivable by product:\nGross combined loans receivable were $511.6 million and $354.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was a result of Installment loan growth from higher originations and the Q1 Loss Recognition Change. For 2017, Installment loans that are up to 90 days past due are included in gross combined loans receivable. Excluding the year-over-year effect of such past-due loans, gross combined loans receivable increased $83.4 million or 23.5% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nUnsecured Installment Loans\nUnsecured Installment revenue and gross combined loans receivable increased from the prior year quarter due to growth in the United States, primarily in Texas and California; growth in Canada, primarily in Alberta; and growth in the United Kingdom. Gross combined Unsecured Installment loan balances (excluding past due loans) grew $49.6 million, or 30.1%, compared to December 31, 2016.\nLoss provision rates as a percentage of loan originations (or loss provision rates) for Company Owned loans increased sequentially from 21.1% to 22.1%, reflecting normal seasonal trends and allowance coverage evaluation. Fourth quarter 2017 provision rate was consistent with the prior year provision rate of 22.0%. The effect of of the Q1 Loss Recognition Change, which caused higher provision rates in 2017 was offset by improved underwriting and credit scoring, and seasoning.\nLoss provision rates for loans Guaranteed by the Company decreased sequentially from 43.3% to 40.0%. This is primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey relief during the third quarter of 2017 on Texas operations. Fourth quarter 2017 provision rates increased compared to the prior year quarter of 31.1%, primarily due to the Q1 Loss Recognition Change, which caused higher provision rates in 2017, as well as loan performance.\nUnsecured Installment Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable and Unsecured Installment CSO guarantee liability as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans Guaranteed by the Company both declined from the end of the third quarter of 2017. This was a result of realization of the impacts of Hurricane Harvey, seasonal patterns in net charge-offs and evaluation of year-end allowance coverage based on underlying vintage performance. Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable and Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans Guaranteed by the Company remained consistent quarter over quarter.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands, except average loan amount, unaudited)\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Installment loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue -

U.S. revenue increased $130.9 million on volume growth, the U.K. increased $5.8 million, and Canada decreased $1.7 million due to regulatory impacts on rates and product mix.\nProvision for losses increased $67.9 million, or 26.3% to $326.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $258.3 million for the prior year because of higher origination volumes and higher loan balances.\nCost of Providing Services\nThe total cost of providing services increased $11.1 million, or 4.0%, to $288.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $277.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to 18.5% higher marketing spend as well as increases in occupancy, office and other operating expenses.\nOperating Expenses\nCorporate, district and other expenses increased $30.7 million primarily due to debt extinguishment costs, share-based cash and non-cash compensation, IPO-related costs and legal settlement costs, as described above in the\nreconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income, as well as increases in payroll, collections, office and technology-related costs.\nInterest expense in the current year period increased by approximately $18.4 million which was the result of accrued interest on the retired notes through the redemption notice period and increased debt outstanding.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 46.4% compared to 39.4% for the prior year. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the full year effective tax rate includes a net one-time charge of $3.9 million from adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognition of tax expense related to Canadian earnings that have not been repatriated. Excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the effective tax rate for full-year 2017 was 41.4%.\nThe remaining change in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to U.K. operations. The 2017 U.K. results include $7.4 million of restructuring costs related to the closure of the remaining 13 U. K. stores. We recorded a 100% valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax asset and therefore did not recognize the related tax benefit.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016 - Segment Analysis\nWe report financial results for three reportable segments: the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

U.S. revenue growth was driven by a $49.4 million, or 18.0%, increase in gross combined loans receivable (excluding past due loans) to $323.6 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $274.2 million in the prior year period. We experienced strong volume growth in Unsecured Installment originations which increased year-over-year $131.9 million, or 27.4%. Secured Installment originations grew $45.9 million, or 33.2%, compared to the same period a year ago.\nThe increase of $59.7 million or 28.8% in provision for losses was primarily driven by the aforementioned increase in gross combined loans receivable and related origination volumes as well as the Q1 Loss Recognition Change.\nU.S. cost of providing services for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $203.0 million, an increase of $8.3 million, or 4.3%, compared to $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to $5.8 million, or 19.1% higher marketing spend, as well as increases in volume-driven expenses and increases in store security and maintenance costs.\nAll other U.S. operating expenses were $215.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $68.2 million, or 46.2%, compared to $147.6 million in the prior year period. Excluding the effects of the items discussed previously in \"Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, non-GAAP measures\" applicable to the U.S. as indicated in the Segment table above, Corporate, district and other operating expenses rose $13.6 million, or 15.6%, primarily due to increased technology and analytics headcount.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada Segment Results\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change $\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for losses\n</td> <td>45,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>141,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising costs\n</td> <td>10,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-advertising costs of providing services\n</td> <td>62,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of providing services\n</td> <td>73,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>67,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate, district and other\n</td> <td>16,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>#\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(898\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>#\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expense\n</td> <td>17,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,004\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>50,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,685\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(16.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>#\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>4,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(281\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>55,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(898\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based cash and non-cash compensation\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>(1,071\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(698\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,290\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(17.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td># - Variance greater than 100% or not meaningful.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue in Canada was affected by product transition in Alberta from Single-Pay loans to Unsecured Installment loans and the impact of regulatory rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia.\nNon-Alberta Single-Pay revenue decreased $1.1 million, or 0.8% to $146.2 million for 2017 and was affected by lower rates from provincial regulatory changes effective January 1, 2017. The impact of the rate changes was offset by higher origination volumes resulting in a modest increase in related revenue. Single-Pay ending receivables (excluding Alberta) increased $9.1 million, or 20.9%, to $52.6 million from $43.5 million in the prior year period.\nBecause of regulatory changes in Alberta, we converted Single-Pay customers to Unsecured Installment loans during the first week of December 2016, resulting in $22.7 million of Unsecured Installment loans outstanding at the end of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, $43.7 million of Unsecured Installment and Open-End receivables were outstanding in Alberta.\nThe provision for losses rose $5.2 million or 12.9% to $45.1 million for full year 2017 compared to $39.9 million in the prior year period. As in the U.S., the increase was due to higher loan origination volume and the shift in Alberta from Single Pay to Unsecured Installment loans.\nThe cost of providing services in Canada increased $3.9 million, or 5.6%, to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $69.5 million in the prior year period due primarily to an increase in occupancy expense, based on a higher number of stores in operation during 2017 as compared to the prior year, as well as an increase in store maintenance costs and higher marketing spend.\nOperating expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 5.5%, to $17.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, from $18.2 million in the prior year period, due to the consolidation of certain back-office functions during the third quarter of 2016.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. Segment Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change $\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for losses\n</td> <td>13,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>25,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising costs\n</td> <td>5,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-advertising costs of providing services\n</td> <td>6,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,652\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(20.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of providing services\n</td> <td>11,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,043\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>14,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate, district and other\n</td> <td>17,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other costs\n</td> <td>7,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>#\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expense\n</td> <td>24,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating loss\n</td> <td>(10,527\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9,239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,288\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(234\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(26.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>(9,891\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(8,384\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,507\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(18.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(277\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other costs\n</td> <td>7,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,533\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td># - Variance greater than 100% or not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.K. revenue improved $5.8 million, or 17.1%, to $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $33.7 million in the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up $7.8 million, or 23.0%. Provision for losses increased $3.0 million, or 28.6%, and increased $3.7 million, or 34.5% on a constant currency basis, due to growth in Installment Loan receivables.\nThe cost of providing services in the United Kingdom decreased slightly from the prior year period because of third quarter 2017 store closures. On a constant currency basis the cost of providing services decreased $0.4 million, or 3.1%.\nOperating expenses increased $5.1 million, or 26.0%, from the prior year period, and on a constant currency basis increased $6.3 million, or 32.4%, due to restructuring costs from closure of the 13 remaining stores during the third quarter of 2017. Excluding the store closure costs, operating expenses decreased $1.3 million, or 7.2%, because of reduced headquarters and contact center headcount and lower professional fees.\nResults of Operations -

Volume growth in the United States and revenue growth in Canada driven by de novo store expansion and modest same-store volume growth, were partially offset by a decline in the U.K. revenue due to currency translation impact, product mix and volume changes, as well as the closure of nearly half of the U.K. stores in December 2015. A detailed discussion of results by segment is included in the Segment Analysis below.\nProvision for losses decreased by $22.9 million, or 8.2% to $258.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $281.2 million for the prior year. Improved performance in the United States resulted from continuous refinements and improvements to scoring models, portfolio seasoning, and improve collection efforts. Lower relative customer acquisition spend in 2016 reduced the volume mix attributable to new customers compared to the same period a year ago. In the United Kingdom, loss provisions have improved because of tightened underwriting and seasoning. The increase in the provision for losses in Canada was due to the growth of newer bankline loan products, which have a higher provision rate as a percent of revenue than traditional Canadian single-pay products.\nCost of Providing Services\nThe total cost of providing services decreased $16.3 million, or 5.5%, to $277.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $293.3 million in the prior year primarily due to a decline in advertising expense of $21.7 million, or 33.1%, compared to the prior year, as we normalized customer acquisition in 2016 to maintain earning-asset levels but without the elevated levels of new customer investment of 2015. In addition, cost-per-funded loan improved significantly year-over-year so less total spend was necessary to drive similar customer volumes. Salaries and benefits also declined compared to the prior year driven by the closure of ten stores in the United Kingdom in December 2015. These declines were partially offset by an increase in other store operating expense which was attributable to higher collections costs, partially offset by a decline in store maintenance costs associated with store refurbishments that took place in the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\nCorporate, district and other expenses declined 4.8% in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily because of U.K. store closures in 2015, a decrease in payroll costs at our U.K. corporate office, and declines in U.K. collections and office expense, as well as the impact of Canadian back-office consolidation during 2016, and the impact of certain intangible assets related to the 2011 Cash Money acquisition which became fully amortized. These declines were partially offset by an increase in U.S. corporate expense from higher payroll costs for additional headcount (primarily analytics and technology) and an increase in variable, performance based compensation, as well as an increase in professional fees and office expense.\nOther changes in operating expenses were affected by a pretax gain of $7.0 million related to the discount on the repurchase of $25.1 million of CFTC's outstanding May 2011 10.75% Senior Secured Notes, as well as $3.6 million of restructuring costs related to the elimination of certain positions, primarily Finance and IT, at our Canadian headquarters, and the closure of seven underperforming The Money Box stores in Texas, and one store in Missouri that we were unable to reopen after it was damaged by a fire, and costs related to the 2015 closure of ten U.K. stores.\nResults in 2015 were also impacted by a $2.9 million non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and $4.3 million of costs related to the closure of ten U.K. stores mentioned above. These costs primarily consisted of adjustments to lease obligations associated with these locations.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 39.4% compared to 50.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our recorded income tax expense is affected by our mix of domestic and foreign earnings.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2015 - Segment Analysis\nWe report financial results for three reportable segments: the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Gross margin as a percent of revenue improved to 33.7%, compared to 26.4% in the prior year from improvement in the provision for losses due to relative new customer mix and growth, related portfolio seasoning, and improved credit scoring and collection trends; as well as a $12.6 million decrease in advertising expense.\nOperating expenses in the United States were flat with the prior year. An increase in corporate expense from higher payroll costs for additional headcount (primarily analytics and technology), an increase in variable, performance-based compensation, as well as an increase in professional fees and office expense, was more than offset by a $7.0 million gain on the extinguishment of $25.1 million of CFTC's May 2011 10.75% Senior Secured Notes.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada Segment Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change $\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for losses\n</td> <td>39,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>148,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising costs\n</td> <td>8,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(26.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-advertising costs of providing services\n</td> <td>60,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of providing services\n</td> <td>69,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(551\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>78,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate, district and other\n</td> <td>17,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,938\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(18.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(43.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other costs\n</td> <td>898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>#\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expense\n</td> <td>18,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>60,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(43.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>4,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(376\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>65,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other costs\n</td> <td>898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>(373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td># - Variance greater than 100% or not meaningful.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue for our Canadian operations was $188.1 million for 2016, an increase of $3.2 million, or 1.7%, compared to the prior year. Growth in Canada was driven by our de novo store expansion and modest same-store volume growth in Ontario, Nova Scotia, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, which offset a $3.8 million, or 11.8%, decline in Alberta due to the statutory rate change.\nThe gross margin for our Canadian operations for 2016 was $78.6 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 1.5%, compared to the prior year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined slightly in the current year to 41.8% from 41.9% for the prior year.\nOperating expenses in Canada decreased $3.1 million, or 14.6%, from the prior year due primarily to the net impact of the elimination of 35 corporate positions in our Canadian headquarters (primarily finance and technology). Amortization expense also declined as certain intangible assets related to the 2011 Cash Money acquisition became fully amortized.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. Segment Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change $\n</td> <td>Change %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,888\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(38.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for losses\n</td> <td>10,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,402\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(49.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>23,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,486\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(31.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising costs\n</td> <td>4,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,938\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(54.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-advertising costs of providing services\n</td> <td>7,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,333\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(40.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of providing services\n</td> <td>12,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,271\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(46.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>10,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate, district and other\n</td> <td>18,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(31.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and impairment charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,882\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>#\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other costs\n</td> <td>994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>76.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expense\n</td> <td>19,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,510\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>42.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating loss\n</td> <td>(9,239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(24,534\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(917\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(51.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>(8,384\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(22,774\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and impairment charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,882\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other costs\n</td> <td>994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,774\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td># - Variance greater than 100% or not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue in the United Kingdom was $33.7 million for 2016, a decrease of $20.9 million, or 38.3%. The decline in the British Pound Sterling from an average exchange rate of $1.5282 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to an average exchange rate of $1.3552 for the year ended December 31, 2016, had a negative impact on our consolidated results. On a constant currency basis, revenue in the United Kingdom decreased $16.5 million, or 30.2%, compared to the prior year. Revenue declined in the United Kingdom because of product mix and volume changes, as well as the closure of nearly half of the U.K. stores in December 2015.\nThe gross margin for our U.K. operations for 2016 was $10.3 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 8.3%, compared to the prior year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue improved to 30.5% compared to 17.4% in the prior year. Improvement in the provision for losses, lower advertising expense, and the impact of the closure of the ten stores to occupancy and salaries and benefits expense all contributed to gross margin improvement.\nStore count\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 407 stores in 14 U.S. states and seven provinces in Canada, which included the following:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>214 U.S. locations: Texas (91), California (36), Nevada (18), Arizona (13), Tennessee (11), Kansas (10), Illinois (8), Alabama (7), Missouri (5), Louisiana (5), Colorado (3), Oregon (3), Washington (2), and Mississippi (2)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>193 Canadian locations: Ontario (124), Alberta (27), British Columbia (26), Saskatchewan (6), Nova Scotia (5), Manitoba (4), and New Brunswick (1)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOnline: We lend online in 27 states in the U.S., five provinces in Canada, and in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.\nFrom January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017 we opened 11 stores: one store in the United States and 10 in Canada.

In February 2017, we issued 12.00% Senior Secured Notes to refinance similar notes that were nearing maturity and whose proceeds had been used primarily for acquisitions and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial ratios, covenants and other requirements set forth in our debt agreements. We anticipate that our primary use of cash will be to fund growth in our working capital, finance capital expenditures and meet our debt obligations. Our level of cash flow provided by operating activities typically experiences some seasonal fluctuation related to our levels of net income and changes in working capital levels, particularly loans receivable.\nUnexpected changes in our financial condition or other unforeseen factors may result in our inability to obtain third-party financing or could increase our borrowing costs in the future. We have the ability to adjust our volume of lending to consumers which would reduce cash outflow requirements while increasing cash inflows through loan repayments to the extent we experience any short-term or long-term funding shortfalls. We may also sell or securitize our assets, draw on our available revolving credit facility or line of credit, enter into additional refinancing agreements and reduce our capital spending in order to generate additional liquidity. We believe our cash on hand and available borrowings provide us with sufficient liquidity for at least the next twelve months.\nBorrowings\nOur long-term debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (net of deferred financing costs):\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>12.00% Senior Secured Notes (due 2022)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>585,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2011 Senior Secured Notes (due 2018)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2012 Senior Secured Notes (due 2018)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 2013 Senior Secured Notes (due 2018)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 2013 Cash Pay Notes (due 2017)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility\n</td> <td>120,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABL Facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Revolver\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total long-term debt, including current portion\n</td> <td>706,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>624,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: current maturities of long-term debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>706,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>477,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAvailable Credit Facilities and Other Resources\n12.00% Senior Secured Notes\nOn February 15, 2017 CURO issued $470.0 million 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due March 1, 2022 (\"12.00% Senior Secured Notes\"). Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2017. The proceeds from the 12.00% Senior Secured Notes were used, together with available cash, to (i) redeem the outstanding 10.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 of our wholly-owned subsidiary, CURO Intermediate, (ii) redeem our outstanding 12.00% Senior Cash Pay Notes due 2017, or the Senior Cash Pay Notes and (iii) pay fees, expenses, premiums and accrued interest in connection with the offering. The extinguishment of all of the 10.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 and the Senior Cash Pay Notes resulted in a pretax loss of $12.5 million in 2017.\nIn connection with this debt issuance we capitalized financing costs of approximately $14.0 million, the balance of which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of Long-Term Debt,\u201d and are being amortized over the term of the 12.00% Senior Secured Notes and included as a component of interest expense.\nOn November 2, 2017, CFTC issued $135.0 million principal amount of additional 12.00% Senior Secured Notes in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, or the Additional Notes Offering. The proceeds from the Additional Notes Offering were used, together with available cash, to (i) pay a cash dividend in an amount of $140.0 million to us, CFTC's sole stockholder, and ultimately our stockholders and (ii) pay fees, expenses, premiums and accrued interest in connection with the Additional Notes Offering. CFTC received the consent of holders holding a majority in the outstanding principal amount outstanding of the current 12.00% Senior Secured Notes to a one-time waiver with respect to the restrictions contained in Section 5.07(a) of the indenture governing the 12.00% Senior Secured Notes to permit the dividend.\nThe 12.00% Senior Secured Notes rank senior in right of payment to all of our and our guarantor entities' existing and future subordinated indebtedness and equal in right of payment with all our and our guarantor entities' existing and future senior indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The 12.00% Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to our credit facilities and certain other\nindebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and to liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors.\nThe 12.00% Senior Secured Notes are secured by liens on substantially all of our and the guarantors' assets, subject to certain exceptions. On or after March 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a premium that will decrease over time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any to the applicable date of redemption. Prior to March 1, 2019, we will be able to redeem up to 40% of the Notes at a redemption price of 112% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. Prior to March 1, 2019, subject to certain terms and conditions, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, by paying a make-whole\u201d premium plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\nOn March 7, 2018, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to redeem $77.5 million of the 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 and to pay related fees, expenses, premiums and accrued interest. See Note 25 - Subsequent Events of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about this transaction.\nNon-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility and ABL Facility\nOn November 17, 2016, CURO Receivables Finance I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the SPV Borrower\u201d) and a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with Victory Park Management, LLC and certain other lenders that provides for an $80.0 million term loan and $45.0 million of initial revolving borrowing capacity, with the ability to expand such revolving borrowing capacity over time and an automatic expansion to $70.0 million on the six-month anniversary of the closing date May 17, 2017 (our Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility\u201d). On November 17, 2016, Intermediate entered into a six-month recourse credit facility with Victory Park Management, LLC and certain other lenders (the \"ABL Facility\") which provided for $25.0 million of borrowing capacity. This facility matured in May 2017 and was repaid through the sale of the underlying collateral to the Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility. See Note 11 - \"Long-Term Debt\" of our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nSenior Revolver\nOn September 1, 2017, we closed a $25 million Senior Secured Revolving Loan Facility (the \"Senior Revolver\"). The negative covenants of the Senior Revolver generally conform to the related provisions in the Indenture for our 12.00% Senior Secured Notes. We believe this facility complements our other financing sources, while providing seasonal short-term liquidity. Under the Senior Revolver, there is $25.0 million maximum availability, including up to $5.0 million of standby letters of credit, for a one-year term, renewable for successive terms following annual review. The Senior Revolver accrues interest at the one-month LIBOR (which may not be negative) plus 5.00% per annum and is repayable on demand. The terms of the Senior Revolver require that the outstanding balance be reduced to $0 for at least 30 consecutive days in each calendar year. The Senior Revolver is guaranteed by all subsidiaries of CURO that guarantee our 12.00% Senior Secured Notes and is secured by a lien on substantially all assets of CURO and the guarantor subsidiaries that is senior to the lien securing our 12.00% Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Revolver was undrawn at December 31, 2017.\nIn February 2018, the Senior Revolver capacity was increased to $29.0 million as permitted by the Indenture to the Senior Secured Notes based upon consolidated tangible assets. The Senior Revolver is now syndicated with participation by a second bank.\nIn connection with this facility we capitalized financing costs of approximately $0.1 million, the balance of which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of Other assets,\u201d and are being amortized over the term of the facility and included as a component of interest expense.\nCash Money Revolving Credit Facility\nCash Money Cheque Cashing, Inc., one of our Canadian subsidiaries, maintains a C$7.3 million revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The Cash Money Revolving Credit Facility provides short-term liquidity required to meet the working capital needs of our Canadian operations. Aggregate draws under the revolving credit facility are limited to the lesser of: (i) the borrowing base, which is defined as a percentage of cash, deposits in transit and accounts receivable, and (ii) C$7.3 million. As of December 31, 2017, the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility was reduced by C$0.3 million in stand-by-letters of credit.\nThe Cash Money Revolving Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of Cash Money's assets and contains various covenants that include, among other things, that the aggregate borrowings outstanding under the facility not exceed the borrowing base, restrictions on the encumbrance of assets and the creation of indebtedness. Borrowings under the Cash Money Revolving Credit Facility bear interest (per annum) at the prime rate of a Canadian chartered bank plus 1.95%.\nThe Cash Money Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet Changes - December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016\nCash - Cash decreased from 2016 primarily because of cash used in the redemption and refinancing of the Company's 12.00% Senior Cash Pay Notes due 2017 and CURO Intermediate's 10.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (\"Former Senior Secured Notes\"). On February 15, 2017, CFTC issued $470.0 million of 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022. The proceeds, along with $122.5 million of company cash, were used to redeem the $539.9 million outstanding Former Senior Secured Notes (including accrued interest, prepayment penalties, transaction costs and the original-issue discount). The decrease in cash from this refinancing was offset partially by cash generated by operations during 2017 and net proceeds after transaction costs of $81.1 million from our initial public offering of 6,666,667 shares of common stock at a price of $14.00 per share. On November 2, 2017, CFTC issued $135.0 million of additional 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022. The proceeds of the notes offering and related issuance premium were used to pay a $140.0 million cash dividend to the Company and, ultimately, the Company's stockholders.\nRestricted Cash - Restricted cash increased from 2016 year end because of increased cash in our consolidated wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiaries, or VIEs, from underlying installment loan volume growth.\nGross Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses - We originated $780.7 million and $184.3 million of Unsecured and Secured Installment Loans, respectively, during 2017 as compared to $533.4 million and $138.4 million in the prior year. As explained in the Loan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis section above, changes in Gross Loans Receivable and related Allowance for Loan Losses were due to high customer demand and loan origination volumes during 2017 that were concentrated in Installment Loans.\nOther Assets - Other assets increased primarily because of the equity investment in Cognical Holdings, Inc. We made a $5.0 million investment on April 20, 2017 and an additional $0.6 million investment in October 2017 that increased the Company's equity ownership from 8.9% to 9.4%. Cognical Holdings, Inc. operates as a business under an online website, www.zibby.com, that facilitates the purchase of household items by underbanked consumers.\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) and Accrued Interest - Changes from year-end 2016 are due to the refinancing of the Former Senior Secured Notes, the conversion of the ABL Facility to the Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility and the issuance of additional 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 in November 2017. See Note 11 Long-Term Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of changes in debt balances.\nCash Flows\nThe following highlights our cash flow activity and the sources and uses of funding during the periods indicated:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(19,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(12,922\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(26,255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(36,691\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>59,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,321\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nCash flows from operating activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 our operating activities provided net cash of $17.4 million. Contributing to current year net cash provided by operating activities were net income of $49.2 million, and non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, the provision for loan losses, and a loss on debt extinguishment for a total of $376.5 million, partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $408.3 million. The most significant change within operating assets and liabilities was a $435.5 million increase in loans receivable.\nLoans receivable will fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of loan issuances and collections. A seasonal decline in consumer loans receivable typically takes place during the first quarter of the year and is driven by income tax refunds in the United States. Customers receiving income tax refunds will use the proceeds to pay outstanding loan balances, resulting in an increase of our net cash balances and a decrease of our consumer loans receivable balances. Consumer loans receivable balances typically reflect growth during the remainder of the year.\nCash flows from investing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we used cash of $19.3 million to increase our restricted cash balances by approximately $4.0 million, to purchase approximately $9.8 million of property and equipment, including software licenses, and to purchase $5.6 million of Cognical Holdings preferred shares. The increase in restricted cash was primarily attributable to our Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash used for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $36.7 million. We extinguished our 10.75% Senior Secured Notes for $426.0 million (which included $8.9 million of call premium) and extinguished our Senior Cash Pay Notes for $130.1 million. These payments were partially financed by proceeds of $447.6 million (net of $14.0 million of debt issuance costs and $8.5 million of discount on notes issued) from the issuance of the 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022. On November 2, 2017, CFTC issued $135.0 million of additional 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022. The proceeds of this notes offering and related issuance premium were used to pay a $140.0 million dividend to the Company and, ultimately, the Company's stockholders. We paid total dividends of $182.0 million to our stockholders during 2017. Our initial public offering of 6,666,667 shares of common stock at a price of $14.00 per share provided net proceeds after transaction costs of $81.1 million. We also had net borrowings of $32.9 million from our U.S. SPV Facility and our ABL Facility.\nYears Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nCash flows from operating activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 our operating activities provided net cash of $47.7 million, compared to $17.1 million in net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015. Contributing to\nnet cash provided by operating activities in 2016 were net income of $65.4 million, and non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, the provision for loan losses, and a benefit related to deferred income taxes, of $278.7 million; non-cash restructuring costs of $0.5 million, partially offset by a $7.0 million non-cash benefit from a gain on debt extinguishment and a $290.0 million net decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The most significant change within operating assets and liabilities was a $287.8 million increase in loans receivable, net of provision for losses.\nLoans receivable will fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of loan issuances and collections. A seasonal decline in consumer loans receivable typically takes place during the first quarter of the year and is driven by income tax refunds in the United States. Customers receiving income tax refunds will use the proceeds to pay outstanding loan balances, resulting in an increase of our net cash balances and a decrease of our consumer loans receivable balances. Consumer loans receivable balances typically reflect growth during the remainder of the year.\nCash flows from investing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we used net cash of $16.0 million for the purchase of property and equipment, including software licenses, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in our restricted cash balance. This compared to $26.3 million in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015. The growth in property and equipment was driven primarily by capital expenditures associated with new store openings in Canada, store refreshes in the United States, and expenditures for software licenses. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we also received \u00a31.4 million ($1.9 million) of funds previously placed in a collateral account with a U.K. banking institution, and received $4.0 million of funds previously placed in a collateral account with a U.S. banking institution. As a result of the borrowings from the Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility, approximately $2.8 million of cash was restricted.\nCash flows from financing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $59.4 million, compared to $12.3 million in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015. The change was primarily due to $91.7 million of proceeds received from new borrowings from our newly created Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility and ABL Facility. In addition, we incurred additional deferred financing costs associated with this debt. During the year ended December 31, 2016, CURO Intermediate used cash of $18.9 million to purchase $25.1 million of outstanding May 2011 10.75% Senior Secured Notes at 71.25% of the principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $1.0 million via an open-market purchase. During the year, we also received proceeds from draws on our credit facilities of $30.0 million, and repaid $38.1 million of the outstanding balance of borrowings on our credit facilities. Borrowings under our credit facilities provided us with short-term liquidity and were used for working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the following table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\nThe expected timing of payments of the obligations below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>385,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>118,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service contracts\n</td> <td>8,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,242,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>882,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) This does not reflect the impact of the redemption of $77.5 million of 12.00% Senior Secured Notes on March 7, 2018, which will reduce Debt obligations due in 3-5 years by $77.5 million and Interest on debt obligations due in Less than 1 year by $4.7 million, due in 1-3 years by $18.6 million, and due in 3-5 years by $14.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 15, 2017, CFTC issued $470.0 million of 12.00% Senior Secured Notes. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2017. The proceeds from the notes and available cash were used to (i) redeem 10.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 of our subsidiary, CURO Intermediate, (ii) redeem our 12.00% Senior Cash Pay Notes due 2017, and (iii) pay fees, expenses, premiums and accrued interest in connection with the offering.\nOn September 1, 2017, we closed a $25.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Loan Facility, or the Senior Revolver. The negative covenants of the Senior Revolver generally conform to the related provision of the Indenture dated February 15, 2017 for our 12.00% Senior Secured Notes and complements our other financing sources, while providing seasonal short-term liquidity. The Senior Revolver was undrawn at December 31, 2017.\nOn November 2, 2017, CFTC issued $135.0 million principal amount of additional 12.00% Senior Secured Notes in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, or the Additional Notes Offering. We used the proceeds from the Additional Notes Offering, together with available cash, to (i) pay a cash dividend, in an amount of $140.0 million, and (ii) pay fees and expenses, in connection therewith. CFTC received the consent of the holders holding a majority in the outstanding principal amount outstanding of the current 12.00% Senior Secured Notes to a one-time waiver with respect to the restrictions contained in Section 5.07(a) of the indenture governing the 12.00% Senior Secured Notes to permit the dividend.\nWe entered into operating lease agreements for the buildings in which we operate that expire at various times through 2030. The majority of the leases have an original term of five years with two 5-year renewal options. Most of the leases have escalation clauses and several also require payment of certain period costs including maintenance, insurance and property taxes. For additional information concerning our operating leases, see Note 19, \"Operating Leases\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe originate loans in all of our store locations and online, except for our operations in Texas and Ohio. In these states, we operate as a Credit Services Organization, or CSO, through three of our operating subsidiaries. Our CSO program in Texas is licensed as a Credit Access Business, or CAB, under Texas Finance Code Chapter 393 and regulated by the Texas Office of the Consumer Credit Commissioner. Our CSO program in Ohio is registered under the Credit Services Organization Act, Ohio Revised Code Sections 4712.01 to 4712.99, and regulated by the Ohio Department of Commerce Division of Financial Institutions. As a CAB, we charge our customers a CSO fee for arranging an unrelated third-party to make a loan to that customer. When a customer executes an agreement with us under our CSO programs, we agree, for a CSO fee payable to us by the customer, to provide certain services to the customer, one of which is to guarantee the customer's obligation to repay the loan the customer receives from the third-party lender if the customer fails to do so. For CSO loans, each lender is responsible for providing the criteria by which the customer's application is underwritten and, if approved,\ndetermining the amount of the customer loan. We in turn are responsible for assessing whether or not we will guarantee the loan. This guarantee represents an obligation to purchase specific loans, if they go in to default. Since the loans are made by a third-party lender, they are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as loans receivable.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the maximum amount payable under all such guarantees was $65.2 million, compared to $59.6 million at December 31, 2016. Should we be required to pay any portion of the total amount of the loans we have guaranteed, we will attempt to recover some or the entire amount from the customers. We hold no collateral in respect of the guarantees. The initial measurement of this guarantee liability is recorded at fair value and reported in the Credit services organization guarantee liability line in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the guarantee is measured by assessing the nature of the loan products, the creditworthiness of the borrowers in the customer base, our historical loan default history for similar loans, industry loan default history, and historical collection rates on similar products, current default trends, past-due account roll rates, changes to underwriting criteria or lending policies, new store development or entrance into new markets, changes in jurisdictional regulations or laws, recent credit trends and general economic conditions. The guarantee liability was $17.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $17.1 million at December 31, 2016, respectively.\nAdditionally, we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Our operating lease obligations are discussed in Note 19 - \"Operating Leases\" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical in understanding our historical and future performance and require management's most subjective and complex judgments.\nCurrent and Past-Due Loans Receivable\nWe classify our loans receivable as either current or past-due. Single-Pay and Open-End Loans are considered past-due when a customer misses a scheduled payment, and it is charged-off to the allowance for loan losses. The charge-off of Unsecured Installment and Secured Installment Loans was impacted by a change in accounting estimate in 2017.\nEffective January 1, 2017, we modified the timeframe in which Installment Loans are charged-off and made related refinements to our loss provisioning methodology. Prior to January 1, 2017, we deemed all loans uncollectible and charged-off when a customer missed a scheduled payment and the loan was considered past-due. Because of our continuing shift from Single-Pay to Installment Loan products and analysis of the timing and quantity of payments on early-stage versus late-stage delinquencies, we revised our estimates and now consider Installment Loans uncollectible when the loan has been past-due for 90 consecutive days. Consequently, past-due Installment Loans remain in loans receivable, with disclosure of past-due balances, for 90 days before being charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. Subsequently, all recoveries on charged-off loans are credited to the allowance for loan losses.\nIn the income statement, the provision for losses for Installment Loans is based on an assessment of the cumulative net losses inherent in the underlying loan portfolios, by vintage, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. The resulting loss provision rate is applied to loan originations to determine the provision for losses. In addition to improving estimated collectability and loss recognition for Installment Loans, we also believe these refinements are better aligned with industry comparisons and practices.\nThe aforementioned change was treated as a change in accounting estimate and is being applied prospectively, effective January 1, 2017. As a result, some credit quality metrics for 2017 may not be comparable to historical periods. Throughout the remainder of this report, we refer to the change as the Q1 Loss Recognition Change.\nInstallment Loans generally are considered past-due when a customer misses a scheduled payment. Loans zero to 90 days past-due are included in gross loans receivable. We accrue interest on past-due loans until charged off. The amount of the resulting charge-off includes unpaid principal, accrued interest and any uncollected fees, if applicable. Consequently, net loss rates that include accrued interest will be higher than under the methodology applied prior to January 1, 2017.\nIn addition to the revised loss provision rates to accommodate the change in estimate, $61.0 million of past-due Installment Loans were included in gross loans receivable as of December 31, 2017. Before the Q1 Loss Recognition Change, no past-due loans were included in gross loans receivable.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is primarily based on back-testing of subsequent collections history by product and cumulative aggregate net losses by product and by vintage. We do not specifically reserve for any individual loan but rather segregate loans into separate pools based upon loan portfolios containing similar risk characteristics. Additional quantitative factors, such as current default trends, past-due account roll rates (expected future cash collections by past-due aging category based on current trends) and changes to underwriting and portfolio mix are also considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance and current provision rates. Qualitative factors such as the impact of new loan products, changes to underwriting criteria or lending policies, new store development or entrance into new markets, changes in jurisdictional regulations or laws, recent credit trends and general economic conditions impact management's judgment on the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nIn addition to the effect on Installment provision rates and loan balances, the Q1 Loss Recognition Change affected comparability of activity in the related allowance for loan losses. Specifically, no Unsecured Installment or Secured Installment Loans were charged-off to the allowance for loan losses in the three months ended March 31, 2017 because charge-off effectively occurs on day 91 under the revised methodology and no affected loans originated during the period reached day 91 until April 2017. Actual charge-offs and recoveries on defaulted/charged-off loans from the three months ended March 31, 2017 affected the allowance for loan losses in prospective periods. But, as discussed previously, the related net losses were recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended December 31, 2017 by applying expected net loss provision rates to the related loan originations.\nCredit Services Organization\nThrough our CSO programs, we act as a credit services organization/credit access business on behalf of customers in accordance with applicable state laws. We currently offer loans through CSO programs in stores and online in the state of Texas and online in the state of Ohio. In Texas we offer Unsecured Installment Loans and Secured Installment Loans with a maximum term of 180 days. In Ohio we offer an Unsecured Installment Loan product with a maximum term of 18 months. As a CSO we earn revenue by charging the customer a fee, or the CSO fee, for arranging an unrelated third-party to make a loan to that customer. When a customer executes an agreement with us under our CSO programs, we agree, for a CSO fee payable to us by the customer, to provide certain services to the customer, one of which is to guarantee the customer's obligation to repay the loan the customer receives from the third-party lender if the customer fails to do so. CSO fees are calculated based on the amount of the customer's outstanding loan. For CSO loans, each lender is responsible for providing the criteria by which the customer's application is underwritten and, if approved, determining the amount of the customer loan. We in turn are responsible for assessing whether or not we will guarantee the loan. This guarantee represents an obligation to purchase specific loans, if they go in to default.\nThese guarantees are performance guarantees as defined in ASC Topic 460. Performance guarantees are initially accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 460 and recognized at fair value, and subsequently pursuant to ASC Topic\n450 as contingent liabilities when we incur losses as the guarantor. The initial measurement of the guarantee liability is recorded at fair value and reported in the Credit services organization guarantee liability line in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The initial fair value of the guarantee is the price we would pay to a third party market participant to assume the guarantee liability. There is no active market for transferring the guarantee liability. Accordingly, we determine the initial fair value of the guarantee by estimating the expected losses on the guaranteed loans. The expected losses on the guaranteed loans are estimated by assessing the nature of the loan products, the credit worthiness of the borrowers in the customer base, our historical loan default history for similar loans, industry loan default history, and historical collection rates on similar products, current default trends, past-due account roll rates, changes to underwriting criteria or lending policies, new store development or entrance into new markets, changes in jurisdictional regulations or laws, recent credit trends and general economic conditions. We review the factors that support estimates of expected losses and the guarantee liability monthly. In addition, because the majority of the underlying loan customers make bi-weekly payments, loan-pool payment performance is evaluated more frequently than monthly.\nOur guarantee liability represents the unamortized portion of the guarantee obligation required to be recognized at inception of the performance guarantee in accordance with ASC Topic 460 and a contingent liability for those performance guarantees where it is probable that we will be required to purchase the guaranteed loan from the lender in accordance with ASC Topic 450.\nCSO fees are calculated based on the amount of the customer's outstanding loan. We comply with the applicable jurisdiction's Credit Services Organization Act or a similar statute. These laws generally define the services that we can provide to consumers and require us to provide a contract to the customer outlining our services and the cost of those services to the customer. For services we provide under our CSO programs, we receive payments from customers on their scheduled loan repayment due dates. The CSO fee is earned ratably over the term of the loan as the customers make payments. If a loan is paid off early, no additional CSO fees are due or collected. The maximum CSO loan term is 180 days and 18 months in Texas and Ohio, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 53.6% and 53.2%, respectively, of Unsecured Installment Loans, and 53.6% and 62.5%, respectively, of Secured Installment Loans originated under CSO programs were paid off prior to the original maturity date.\nSince CSO loans are made by a third-party lender, we do not include them in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as loans receivable. CSO fees receivable are included in Prepaid expense and other\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We receive payments from customers for these fees on their scheduled loan repayment due dates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a growth-oriented consumer finance company serving underbanked consumers in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. It discusses recent developments such as an initial public offering and a notice of redemption for senior secured notes.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\"MD&A\")\nThe following discussion of financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and certain factors that may affect future results, including economic and industry-wide factors, should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included herein. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law and regulations, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other statements we may make in the following discussion or elsewhere in this document even though these statements may be affected by events or circumstances occurring after the forward-looking statements or other statements were made. Please see the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe are a growth-oriented, technology-enabled, highly-diversified consumer finance company serving a wide range of underbanked consumers in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and are a market leader in our industry based on revenues. We believe that we have the only true omni-channel customer acquisition, onboarding and servicing platform in our industry that is integrated across store, online, mobile and contact center touchpoints. Our IT platform, which we refer to as the Curo Platform,\u201d seamlessly integrates loan underwriting, scoring, servicing, collections, regulatory compliance and reporting activities into a single, centralized system. We use advanced risk analytics powered by proprietary algorithms and over 15 years of loan performance data to efficiently and effectively score our customers' loan applications. Since 2010, we have extended $14.5 billion in total credit across approximately 38.1 million total loans, and our revenue of $963.6 million in 2017 represents a 24.8% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, over the same time period.\nWe operate in the United States under two principal brands, Speedy Cash\u201d and Rapid Cash,\u201d and launched our new brand Avio Credit\u201d in the United States in the second quarter of 2017. In the United Kingdom we operate online as Wage Day Advance\u201d and \"Juo Loans\" and, prior to their closure in the third quarter of 2017, our stores were branded Speedy Cash.\u201d In Canada, our stores are branded Cash Money\u201d and we offer LendDirect\u201d installment loans online. As of December 31, 2017, our store network consisted of 407 locations across 14 U.S. states and seven Canadian provinces. As of December 31, 2017, we offered our online services in 27 U.S. states, five Canadian provinces, and the United Kingdom.\nRecent Developments\nWe completed our initial public offering (\"IPO\") of 6,666,667 shares of common stock on December 11, 2017, at a price of $14.00 per share, which provided net proceeds of $81.1 million. In connection with the closing, the underwriters had a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,000,000 shares at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discount to over-allotments, which they exercised on January 5, 2018, which provided additional net proceeds of $13.0 million.\nOn February 5, 2018 CURO Financial Technologies Corp. ( CFTC\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued a notice of redemption for $77.5 million of its 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the Notes,\u201d and the transaction whereby the Notes are partially redeemed, the Redemption\u201d) that were issued by CFTC. The redemption was completed on March 7, 2018. The redemption price was equal to 112.00% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest paid thereon, to the date of redemption. Following the Redemption, $527.5 million of the original outstanding principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding. The Redemption was conducted pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes (the Indenture\u201d), dated as of February 15, 2017, by and among CFTC, the guarantors party thereto and TMI Trust Company, as trustee and collateral agent. Consistent with the terms of the Indenture, CFTC used a portion of the cash proceeds from the Company's initial public offering, completed on December 11, 2017, to redeem such Notes.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe offer a variety of loan products including Installment, Open-End and Single-Pay Loans. Revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income includes: interest income, finance charges, CSO fees, late fees and non-sufficient funds fees as permitted by applicable laws and pursuant to the agreement with the customer. Product offerings differ by jurisdiction and are governed by the laws in each separate jurisdiction.\nInstallment Loans are fully amortizing loans with a fixed payment amount due each period during the term of the loan. We record revenue from Installment Loans on a simple-interest basis. Accrued interest and fees are included in gross loans receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOpen-End Loans are a revolving line-of-credit with no defined loan term. We record revenue from Open-End Loans on a simple-interest basis. Accrued interest and fees are included in gross loans receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSingle-Pay Loans are primarily payday loans. Revenues from Single-Pay loan products are recognized each period on a constant-yield basis ratably over the term of each loan. We defer recognition of unearned fees based on the remaining term of the loan at the end of each reporting period.\nWe also provide a number of ancillary financial products including check cashing, proprietary reloadable prepaid debit cards (Opt+), money transfer services, gold buying, credit protection insurance in the Canadian market, and retail installment sales.\nProvision for Losses\nWe calculate provision for losses based on evaluation of the historical and expected cumulative net losses inherent in the underlying loan portfolios, by vintage, and several other quantitative and qualitative factors. We apply the resulting loss provision rate to our loan originations to determine the provision for losses. Accordingly, at the time we originate a loan, we recognize a loss on a portion of the loan balance based upon the applicable loss provision rate. We would then recognize any revenue in connection with that loan over the life of the loan, as described above. We may also record additional provision for losses for owned loans in connection with the periodic assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nQ1 2017 Loss Recognition Change\nEffective January 1, 2017, we modified the timeframe in which Installment Loans are charged-off and made related refinements to our loss provisioning methodology. Prior to January 1, 2017, we deemed all loans uncollectible and charged-off when a customer missed a scheduled payment and the loan was considered past-due. Because of our continuing shift from Single-Pay to Installment Loan products and our analysis of payment\npatterns on early-stage versus late-stage delinquencies, we revised our estimates and now consider Installment Loans uncollectible when the loan has been contractually past-due for 90 consecutive days. Consequently, past-due Installment Loans and related accrued interest remain in loans receivable, with disclosure of past-due balances, for 90 days before being charged off against the allowance for loan losses. All recoveries on charged-off loans are credited to the allowance for loan losses. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses compared to the related gross loans receivable balances that include accrued interest.\nIn the income statement, the provision for losses for Installment Loans is based on assessment of the cumulative net losses inherent in the underlying loan portfolios, by vintage, and several other quantitative and qualitative factors. The resulting loss provision rate is applied to loan originations to determine the provision for losses. In addition to improving estimated collectability and loss recognition for Installment Loans, we also believe these refinements result in a loss provisioning methodology that is better aligned with industry comparisons and practices.\nThe aforementioned change was treated as a change in accounting estimate for accounting purposes and applied prospectively beginning January 1, 2017, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as the Q1 Loss Recognition Change.\nThe change affects comparability to prior periods as follows:\n \u2022 Gross Combined Loans Receivable-balances in 2017 include Installment Loans that are up to 90 days past-due with related accrued interest, while balances in prior periods do not include these loans. \n \u2022 Revenues-for the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues include accrued interest on past-due loan balances, while revenues in prior periods do not include these amounts. \n \u2022 Provision for Losses-prospectively, loans charged off on day 91 include accrued interest. Thus, provision rates in 2017 have been adjusted to include both principal and accrued interest. Additionally, because loss provision rates are applied to originations while charge-offs and recoveries are applied to the allowance for loan losses, provisioning is less affected by seasonality for the first quarter income tax refunds in the United States, which increases recoveries of delinquent balances. \nFor a full discussion of the change, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report.\nHurricane Harvey Impact\nIn a good-faith effort to help our store and online customers in the affected areas of Houston, Corpus Christi and the surrounding areas we waived loan payments that were due during the period from August 25, 2017 to September 8, 2017. This affected approximately 22,500 customers and amounted to approximately $3.0 million in total loan payments. The waived payments and losses on secured installment loans in the market increased our provision for losses by approximately $3.3 million. Property damage to our 18 stores in the affected areas was not material. Our stores in the Texas markets resumed normal operations in September.\nCost of Providing Services\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits include personnel-related costs for our store operations, including salaries, benefits and bonuses and are driven by the number of employees.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy and equipment includes rent expense for our leased facilities, as well as depreciation, maintenance, insurance, and utility expense.\nOffice\nOffice includes expenses related to software, computer hardware, bank service charges, credit scoring charges and other office supplies.\nOther Costs of Providing Services\nOur other costs of providing services includes expenses related to operations such as processing fees, collections expense, security expense, taxes, repairs and professional fees.\nAdvertising\nAll advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising includes costs associated with attracting, retaining and/or reactivating customers as well as creating awareness for the brands we promote. Creative, web and print design capabilities exist within the Company and are rarely outsourced. The use of third-party agencies is limited to mass-media production and placement. Advertising expense also includes costs for all marketing activities including paid search, advertising on social networking sites, affiliate programs, direct response television, radio air time and direct mail.\nOperating Expense\nCorporate, District and Other Expenses\nCorporate, district and other expenses include costs such as salaries and benefits associated with our corporate and district-level employees, as well as other corporate-related costs such as rent, insurance, professional fees, utilities, travel and entertainment expenses and depreciation expense.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily includes interest related to our Notes and our SPV Facility.\nOther Expenses\nOther (income) and expense includes the foreign currency impact to our intercompany balances, gains or losses on foreign currency exchanges and disposals of fixed assets and other miscellaneous income and expense amounts.\nDiscussion of Revenue by Product and Segment and Related Loan Portfolio Performance\nRevenue by Product\nUnsecured and Secured Installment revenue includes interest income, CSO fees, and non-sufficient funds or returned-items fees on late or defaulted payments on past-due loans (to which we refer collectively as late fees\u201d). Late fees comprise less than one-half of one percent of Installment revenues.\nOpen-End revenues include interest income on outstanding revolving balances and other usage or maintenance fees as permitted by underlying statutes.\nSingle-Pay revenues represent deferred presentment or other fees as defined by the underlying state, provincial or national regulations.\nThe following table summarizes revenue by product, including CSO fees, for 2017 and 2016:\n\nFor full year 2017, total lending revenue (excluding revenues from ancillary products) grew $131.1 million, or 16.5%, to $923.5 million, compared to the prior year period. Growth was driven predominantly by Unsecured and Secured Installment loan revenue. Unsecured installment loan revenues rose 45.2% on related origination increase of 46.4%. Secured installment revenues increased 24.0% on related origination increase of 33.2%. Single-Pay revenues were affected primarily by regulatory changes in Canada (rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia and product changes in Alberta). U.S. and U.K. Single-Pay revenues also decreased 8.6% and 37.8%, respectively, because of continued mix shift from Single-Pay to Installment and Open-End products. Ancillary revenues increased 10.8% versus the same period a year ago primarily due to insurance revenue in Canada, partially offset by a decrease in check cashing fees. U.K. revenue increased $5.8 million, or 17.1% ($7.8 million or 23.0%, on a constant currency basis).\nThe following table summarizes revenue by product for 2016 and 2015:\n\nTotal lending revenue (excluding revenues from ancillary products) grew $18.8 million, or 2.4%, compared to the prior year, driven by growth in Installment and Open-End Loans. Unsecured Installment revenues rose 5.2% on related gross combined loan receivables growth of 29.0%, led by 7.9% growth in the United States (primarily in Texas, California and Missouri). U.K. Unsecured Installment revenues declined 41.7% because we discontinued a longer-term Installment Loan product in late 2015 due to regulatory changes. Secured Installment revenues decreased 5.6% mostly driven by competitive pressures in Nevada and Arizona. Open-End revenues grew 30.5% year-over-year primarily because in Kansas and Tennessee we replaced Single-pay products with Open-End products. Single-Pay revenues declined 2.6%. In the United States, the decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned changes in Kansas and Tennessee. Ancillary revenues were down 8.4% year-over-year primarily because secular declines in check usage continue to affect check-cashing revenues and we experienced tighter margins on foreign currency exchange. U.K. revenue comparisons are also affected meaningfully by a weaker pound. On a constant-currency basis, U.K. revenue declined $16.5 million, or 30.2%, compared to the prior year.\nLoan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis\nThe following table summarizes Company-owned gross loans receivable, a GAAP balance sheet measure, and reconciles it to gross combined loans receivable, a non-GAAP measure including loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in the consolidated financial statements but from which we earn revenue and for which we provide a guarantee to the lender:\n\nThe following table presents gross combined loans receivable by product:\nGross combined loans receivable were $511.6 million and $354.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was a result of Installment loan growth from higher originations and the Q1 Loss Recognition Change. For 2017, Installment loans that are up to 90 days past due are included in gross combined loans receivable. Excluding the year-over-year effect of such past-due loans, gross combined loans receivable increased $83.4 million or 23.5% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nUnsecured Installment Loans\nUnsecured Installment revenue and gross combined loans receivable increased from the prior year quarter due to growth in the United States, primarily in Texas and California; growth in Canada, primarily in Alberta; and growth in the United Kingdom. Gross combined Unsecured Installment loan balances (excluding past due loans) grew $49.6 million, or 30.1%, compared to December 31, 2016.\nLoss provision rates as a percentage of loan originations (or loss provision rates) for Company Owned loans increased sequentially from 21.1% to 22.1%, reflecting normal seasonal trends and allowance coverage evaluation. Fourth quarter 2017 provision rate was consistent with the prior year provision rate of 22.0%. The effect of of the Q1 Loss Recognition Change, which caused higher provision rates in 2017 was offset by improved underwriting and credit scoring, and seasoning.\nLoss provision rates for loans Guaranteed by the Company decreased sequentially from 43.3% to 40.0%. This is primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey relief during the third quarter of 2017 on Texas operations. Fourth quarter 2017 provision rates increased compared to the prior year quarter of 31.1%, primarily due to the Q1 Loss Recognition Change, which caused higher provision rates in 2017, as well as loan performance.\nUnsecured Installment Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable and Unsecured Installment CSO guarantee liability as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans Guaranteed by the Company both declined from the end of the third quarter of 2017. This was a result of realization of the impacts of Hurricane Harvey, seasonal patterns in net charge-offs and evaluation of year-end allowance coverage based on underlying vintage performance. Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable and Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans Guaranteed by the Company remained consistent quarter over quarter.\n\n\nSecured Installment Loans\nSecured Installment loan revenue and gross combined loans receivable increased from the prior year due primarily to growth in California and Arizona. Gross combined Secured Installment loan balances (excluding past due loans) increased by $8.5 million, or 12.6%, compared to December 31, 2016, on higher origination volumes. Secured Installment Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Secured Installment gross loans receivable settled at a more normalized range in the fourth quarter and improved slightly over the same quarter a year ago on underlying vintage performance. The Past-due Secured Installment gross loans receivable rate was consistent sequentially with third quarter.\n\nOpen-End Loans\nOpen-End loan balances increased by $17.5 million, or 57.4%, compared to December 31, 2016, from year-over-year growth in Kansas and Tennessee of 21.3% and 24.2%, respectively, the 2017 launch of Open-End in Virginia ($6.2 million in balances at the end of 2017) and conversion in the fourth quarter of 2017 of LendDirect Unsecured Installment loans to Open-End in Canada ($7.2 million in balances at the end of 2017). The provision for losses and Open-End Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Open-end gross loans receivable decreased due to improved collection trends and portfolio performance for existing markets, seasoning of the Tennessee loan book and the effect on mix of converting LendDirect to Open-End - as with our experience with other products in Canada, the LendDirect Open-End portfolio is expected to perform better relative to U.S. products.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\"MD&A\")\nThe following discussion of financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and certain factors that may affect future results, including economic and industry-wide factors, should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included herein. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law and regulations, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other statements we may make in the following discussion or elsewhere in this document even though these statements may be affected by events or circumstances occurring after the forward-looking statements or other statements were made. Please see the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe are a growth-oriented, technology-enabled, highly-diversified consumer finance company serving a wide range of underbanked consumers in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and are a market leader in our industry based on revenues. We believe that we have the only true omni-channel customer acquisition, onboarding and servicing platform in our industry that is integrated across store, online, mobile and contact center touchpoints. Our IT platform, which we refer to as the Curo Platform,\u201d seamlessly integrates loan underwriting, scoring, servicing, collections, regulatory compliance and reporting activities into a single, centralized system. We use advanced risk analytics powered by proprietary algorithms and over 15 years of loan performance data to efficiently and effectively score our customers' loan applications. Since 2010, we have extended $14.5 billion in total credit across approximately 38.1 million total loans, and our revenue of $963.6 million in 2017 represents a 24.8% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, over the same time period.\nWe operate in the United States under two principal brands, Speedy Cash\u201d and Rapid Cash,\u201d and launched our new brand Avio Credit\u201d in the United States in the second quarter of 2017. In the United Kingdom we operate online as Wage Day Advance\u201d and \"Juo Loans\" and, prior to their closure in the third quarter of 2017, our stores were branded Speedy Cash.\u201d In Canada, our stores are branded Cash Money\u201d and we offer LendDirect\u201d installment loans online. As of December 31, 2017, our store network consisted of 407 locations across 14 U.S. states and seven Canadian provinces. As of December 31, 2017, we offered our online services in 27 U.S. states, five Canadian provinces, and the United Kingdom.\nRecent Developments\nWe completed our initial public offering (\"IPO\") of 6,666,667 shares of common stock on December 11, 2017, at a price of $14.00 per share, which provided net proceeds of $81.1 million. In connection with the closing, the underwriters had a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,000,000 shares at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discount to over-allotments, which they exercised on January 5, 2018, which provided additional net proceeds of $13.0 million.\nOn February 5, 2018 CURO Financial Technologies Corp. ( CFTC\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued a notice of redemption for $77.5 million of its 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the Notes,\u201d and the transaction whereby the Notes are partially redeemed, the Redemption\u201d) that were issued by CFTC. The redemption was completed on March 7, 2018. The redemption price was equal to 112.00% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest paid thereon, to the date of redemption. Following the Redemption, $527.5 million of the original outstanding principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding. The Redemption was conducted pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes (the Indenture\u201d), dated as of February 15, 2017, by and among CFTC, the guarantors party thereto and TMI Trust Company, as trustee and collateral agent. Consistent with the terms of the Indenture, CFTC used a portion of the cash proceeds from the Company's initial public offering, completed on December 11, 2017, to redeem such Notes.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe offer a variety of loan products including Installment, Open-End and Single-Pay Loans. Revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income includes: interest income, finance charges, CSO fees, late fees and non-sufficient funds fees as permitted by applicable laws and pursuant to the agreement with the customer. Product offerings differ by jurisdiction and are governed by the laws in each separate jurisdiction.\nInstallment Loans are fully amortizing loans with a fixed payment amount due each period during the term of the loan. We record revenue from Installment Loans on a simple-interest basis. Accrued interest and fees are included in gross loans receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOpen-End Loans are a revolving line-of-credit with no defined loan term. We record revenue from Open-End Loans on a simple-interest basis. Accrued interest and fees are included in gross loans receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSingle-Pay Loans are primarily payday loans. Revenues from Single-Pay loan products are recognized each period on a constant-yield basis ratably over the term of each loan. We defer recognition of unearned fees based on the remaining term of the loan at the end of each reporting period.\nWe also provide a number of ancillary financial products including check cashing, proprietary reloadable prepaid debit cards (Opt+), money transfer services, gold buying, credit protection insurance in the Canadian market, and retail installment sales.\nProvision for Losses\nWe calculate provision for losses based on evaluation of the historical and expected cumulative net losses inherent in the underlying loan portfolios, by vintage, and several other quantitative and qualitative factors. We apply the resulting loss provision rate to our loan originations to determine the provision for losses. Accordingly, at the time we originate a loan, we recognize a loss on a portion of the loan balance based upon the applicable loss provision rate. We would then recognize any revenue in connection with that loan over the life of the loan, as described above. We may also record additional provision for losses for owned loans in connection with the periodic assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nQ1 2017 Loss Recognition Change\nEffective January 1, 2017, we modified the timeframe in which Installment Loans are charged-off and made related refinements to our loss provisioning methodology. Prior to January 1, 2017, we deemed all loans uncollectible and charged-off when a customer missed a scheduled payment and the loan was considered past-due. Because of our continuing shift from Single-Pay to Installment Loan products and our analysis of payment\npatterns on early-stage versus late-stage delinquencies, we revised our estimates and now consider Installment Loans uncollectible when the loan has been contractually past-due for 90 consecutive days. Consequently, past-due Installment Loans and related accrued interest remain in loans receivable, with disclosure of past-due balances, for 90 days before being charged off against the allowance for loan losses. All recoveries on charged-off loans are credited to the allowance for loan losses. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses compared to the related gross loans receivable balances that include accrued interest.\nIn the income statement, the provision for losses for Installment Loans is based on assessment of the cumulative net losses inherent in the underlying loan portfolios, by vintage, and several other quantitative and qualitative factors. The resulting loss provision rate is applied to loan originations to determine the provision for losses. In addition to improving estimated collectability and loss recognition for Installment Loans, we also believe these refinements result in a loss provisioning methodology that is better aligned with industry comparisons and practices.\nThe aforementioned change was treated as a change in accounting estimate for accounting purposes and applied prospectively beginning January 1, 2017, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as the Q1 Loss Recognition Change.\nThe change affects comparability to prior periods as follows:\n \u2022 Gross Combined Loans Receivable-balances in 2017 include Installment Loans that are up to 90 days past-due with related accrued interest, while balances in prior periods do not include these loans. \n \u2022 Revenues-for the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues include accrued interest on past-due loan balances, while revenues in prior periods do not include these amounts. \n \u2022 Provision for Losses-prospectively, loans charged off on day 91 include accrued interest. Thus, provision rates in 2017 have been adjusted to include both principal and accrued interest. Additionally, because loss provision rates are applied to originations while charge-offs and recoveries are applied to the allowance for loan losses, provisioning is less affected by seasonality for the first quarter income tax refunds in the United States, which increases recoveries of delinquent balances. \nFor a full discussion of the change, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report.\nHurricane Harvey Impact\nIn a good-faith effort to help our store and online customers in the affected areas of Houston, Corpus Christi and the surrounding areas we waived loan payments that were due during the period from August 25, 2017 to September 8, 2017. This affected approximately 22,500 customers and amounted to approximately $3.0 million in total loan payments. The waived payments and losses on secured installment loans in the market increased our provision for losses by approximately $3.3 million. Property damage to our 18 stores in the affected areas was not material. Our stores in the Texas markets resumed normal operations in September.\nCost of Providing Services\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits include personnel-related costs for our store operations, including salaries, benefits and bonuses and are driven by the number of employees.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy and equipment includes rent expense for our leased facilities, as well as depreciation, maintenance, insurance, and utility expense.\nOffice\nOffice includes expenses related to software, computer hardware, bank service charges, credit scoring charges and other office supplies.\nOther Costs of Providing Services\nOur other costs of providing services includes expenses related to operations such as processing fees, collections expense, security expense, taxes, repairs and professional fees.\nAdvertising\nAll advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising includes costs associated with attracting, retaining and/or reactivating customers as well as creating awareness for the brands we promote. Creative, web and print design capabilities exist within the Company and are rarely outsourced. The use of third-party agencies is limited to mass-media production and placement. Advertising expense also includes costs for all marketing activities including paid search, advertising on social networking sites, affiliate programs, direct response television, radio air time and direct mail.\nOperating Expense\nCorporate, District and Other Expenses\nCorporate, district and other expenses include costs such as salaries and benefits associated with our corporate and district-level employees, as well as other corporate-related costs such as rent, insurance, professional fees, utilities, travel and entertainment expenses and depreciation expense.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily includes interest related to our Notes and our SPV Facility.\nOther Expenses\nOther (income) and expense includes the foreign currency impact to our intercompany balances, gains or losses on foreign currency exchanges and disposals of fixed assets and other miscellaneous income and expense amounts.\nDiscussion of Revenue by Product and Segment and Related Loan Portfolio Performance\nRevenue by Product\nUnsecured and Secured Installment revenue includes interest income, CSO fees, and non-sufficient funds or returned-items fees on late or defaulted payments on past-due loans (to which we refer collectively as late fees\u201d). Late fees comprise less than one-half of one percent of Installment revenues.\nOpen-End revenues include interest income on outstanding revolving balances and other usage or maintenance fees as permitted by underlying statutes.\nSingle-Pay revenues represent deferred presentment or other fees as defined by the underlying state, provincial or national regulations.\nThe following table summarizes revenue by product, including CSO fees, for 2017 and 2016:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>Canada\n</td> <td>U.K.\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>Canada\n</td> <td>U.K.\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Installment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>318,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Installment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open-End\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-Pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ancillary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>737,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>963,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>606,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>828,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor full year 2017, total lending revenue (excluding revenues from ancillary products) grew $131.1 million, or 16.5%, to $923.5 million, compared to the prior year period. Growth was driven predominantly by Unsecured and Secured Installment loan revenue. Unsecured installment loan revenues rose 45.2% on related origination increase of 46.4%. Secured installment revenues increased 24.0% on related origination increase of 33.2%. Single-Pay revenues were affected primarily by regulatory changes in Canada (rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia and product changes in Alberta). U.S. and U.K. Single-Pay revenues also decreased 8.6% and 37.8%, respectively, because of continued mix shift from Single-Pay to Installment and Open-End products. Ancillary revenues increased 10.8% versus the same period a year ago primarily due to insurance revenue in Canada, partially offset by a decrease in check cashing fees. U.K. revenue increased $5.8 million, or 17.1% ($7.8 million or 23.0%, on a constant currency basis).\nThe following table summarizes revenue by product for 2016 and 2015:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>Canada\n</td> <td>U.K.\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S.\n</td> <td>Canada\n</td> <td>U.K.\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Installment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>318,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured Installment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open-End\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-Pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>313,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ancillary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>606,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>828,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>573,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>813,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal lending revenue (excluding revenues from ancillary products) grew $18.8 million, or 2.4%, compared to the prior year, driven by growth in Installment and Open-End Loans. Unsecured Installment revenues rose 5.2% on related gross combined loan receivables growth of 29.0%, led by 7.9% growth in the United States (primarily in Texas, California and Missouri). U.K. Unsecured Installment revenues declined 41.7% because we discontinued a longer-term Installment Loan product in late 2015 due to regulatory changes. Secured Installment revenues decreased 5.6% mostly driven by competitive pressures in Nevada and Arizona. Open-End revenues grew 30.5% year-over-year primarily because in Kansas and Tennessee we replaced Single-pay products with Open-End products. Single-Pay revenues declined 2.6%. In the United States, the decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned changes in Kansas and Tennessee. Ancillary revenues were down 8.4% year-over-year primarily because secular declines in check usage continue to affect check-cashing revenues and we experienced tighter margins on foreign currency exchange. U.K. revenue comparisons are also affected meaningfully by a weaker pound. On a constant-currency basis, U.K. revenue declined $16.5 million, or 30.2%, compared to the prior year.\nLoan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis\nThe following table summarizes Company-owned gross loans receivable, a GAAP balance sheet measure, and reconciles it to gross combined loans receivable, a non-GAAP measure including loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in the consolidated financial statements but from which we earn revenue and for which we provide a guarantee to the lender:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>March 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company-owned gross loans receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross loans receivable guaranteed by the Company\n</td> <td>78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross combined loans receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>511.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>464.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>362.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>303.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>285.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents gross combined loans receivable by product:\nGross combined loans receivable were $511.6 million and $354.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was a result of Installment loan growth from higher originations and the Q1 Loss Recognition Change. For 2017, Installment loans that are up to 90 days past due are included in gross combined loans receivable. Excluding the year-over-year effect of such past-due loans, gross combined loans receivable increased $83.4 million or 23.5% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nUnsecured Installment Loans\nUnsecured Installment revenue and gross combined loans receivable increased from the prior year quarter due to growth in the United States, primarily in Texas and California; growth in Canada, primarily in Alberta; and growth in the United Kingdom. Gross combined Unsecured Installment loan balances (excluding past due loans) grew $49.6 million, or 30.1%, compared to December 31, 2016.\nLoss provision rates as a percentage of loan originations (or loss provision rates) for Company Owned loans increased sequentially from 21.1% to 22.1%, reflecting normal seasonal trends and allowance coverage evaluation. Fourth quarter 2017 provision rate was consistent with the prior year provision rate of 22.0%. The effect of of the Q1 Loss Recognition Change, which caused higher provision rates in 2017 was offset by improved underwriting and credit scoring, and seasoning.\nLoss provision rates for loans Guaranteed by the Company decreased sequentially from 43.3% to 40.0%. This is primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey relief during the third quarter of 2017 on Texas operations. Fourth quarter 2017 provision rates increased compared to the prior year quarter of 31.1%, primarily due to the Q1 Loss Recognition Change, which caused higher provision rates in 2017, as well as loan performance.\nUnsecured Installment Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable and Unsecured Installment CSO guarantee liability as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans Guaranteed by the Company both declined from the end of the third quarter of 2017. This was a result of realization of the impacts of Hurricane Harvey, seasonal patterns in net charge-offs and evaluation of year-end allowance coverage based on underlying vintage performance. Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable and Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans Guaranteed by the Company remained consistent quarter over quarter.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands, except average loan amount, unaudited)\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Installment loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue -
