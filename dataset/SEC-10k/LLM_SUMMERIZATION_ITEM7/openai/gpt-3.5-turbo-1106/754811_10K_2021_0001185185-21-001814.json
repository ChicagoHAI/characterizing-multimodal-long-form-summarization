Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated results of operations of U.S. Global Investors, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, U.S. Global\u201d or the Company\u201d) for the past two fiscal years and other factors that may affect future financial performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Trends in Financial Markets\nThe Company's operating revenues are highly correlated to the level of assets under management ( AUM\u201d) and fees associated with various investment products. While AUM is directly impacted by changes in the financial markets, it is also impacted by cash inflows or outflows due to shareholder activity. Performance fees on certain equity fund products may also impact revenues, either positively or negatively. Various products may have different fees, so changes in our product mix may also affect revenues. For example, international equity products will generally have a higher fee than fixed income products, so changes in assets in those products will have a larger impact on revenues.\nWhile products are offered for a wide variety of markets, the Company has traditionally focused on gold mining and exploration, natural resources, and emerging markets. More recently the airline industry has become more significant to our revenue. All these markets are volatile and subject to capital cycles.\nWith a widespread roll out of the various COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, the economy began to open back up with travel and office work returning to a new normal. Energy demand picked up significantly with crude oil prices approaching an 80 percent gain for the trailing year. Travel and luxury goods rebounded with airlines rising nearly 45 percent and luxury goods companies up 56 percent. There was broad strength across the industrial metals, and copper rose 55 percent for the trailing year. For precious metals, silver was the leader, up 44 percent, followed closely by palladium at 43 percent. Platinum gained 30 percent, after a slightly negative return in the prior year. Spot gold finished the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, at $1,770.11, down less than 1 percent from June 30, 2020. Rising interest rates across the longer end of the yield curve were a headwind to gold with the yield on the 10-year U.S. government note rising to 1.47 percent from a low of 0.66 percent a year earlier. The pick-up in yield, however, was not accompanied by any changes in the Federal Funds Target Rate with the upper bound remaining set at 0.25 percent.\nThe Company's emerging markets products had positive gains but only about half the gains that U.S. equity markets experienced, which was largely a function of how well various regions contained the virus through vaccinations. Eastern European markets gained about 22 percent compared to the S&P 500's gain of 41 percent. Trade tensions still exist between the U.S. and China despite the change in presidential power, and President Biden has been slow to relax many of the trade barriers erected against China. Many regions in the world, including the U.S., have pockets of unvaccinated people, which is allowing the Delta variant of COVID-19 to potentially mutate again.\nComing out of the virus lockdown, GDP growth in the U.S. has been robust, averaging high signal digits the last 3 quarters. This has triggered some renewed inflation concerns with some materials like lumber, the reduced availability of which has led to skyrocketing prices for this commodity amid strong demand for housing. The current thinking by the Fed on inflation is that it will be transitory. Civil and political unrest peaked with the storming of the nation's capital as the Senate was voting to confirm Joe Biden as the next President of the United States of America. Expanded social services are a priority of the new administration that will be funded through taxes at a time when there is great political stress. Modern Monetary Theory continues to reverberate in the news. We would expect the U.S. dollar to decline in value with more deficit spending, perhaps prompting investor to seek inflation protection through precious metals and other commodities.\nIn addition to its gold, natural resources and emerging markets funds, the Company has global equity and domestic fixed income funds. While these products do not drive the Company's profitability as much as the more specialized products, they provide an opportunity to offer shareholders diversification and less volatility than the niche markets.\nMutual funds in general continued to see outflows compared to other investment alternatives, including ETFs. The Company has two ETF products listed on the New York Stock Exchange: the U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS), which concentrates on the U.S. and international airline industry, and the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (ticker GOAU), which invests in companies engaged in the production of precious metals either through active (mining or production) or passive (owning royalties or production streams) means. The Company has one European-based ETF product listed on various exchanges in Europe, the U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF (ticker JETS), which concentrates on the U.S. and international airline industry.\nThe spread of the global COVID-19 outbreak and actions taken in response have affected the global and domestic economies and financial markets. Market declines affect the Company's assets under management, and thus its revenues and also the valuation of the Company's corporate investments. The Company cannot determine the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business. Should this emerging macro-economic risk continue for an extended period, there could be an adverse material financial impact to the Company's business and investments, including a material reduction in its results of operations.\nCOVID-19-related circumstances (e.g., remote work arrangements) have not adversely affected the Company's ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures.\nAssets in the U.S. Global Jets ETF ( Jets ETF\u201d) (ticker JETS) started to accelerate in the latter part of March 2020 and continued through fiscal year 2021. Assets in the Jets ETF were $3.6 billion and $1.2 billion at June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Jets ETF invests in airline-related stocks, including global airline carriers, airport operators and aircraft manufacturers. While global financial markets have experienced volatility, including stocks in which the Jets ETF invests, this ETF has attracted inflows.\nTo manage expenses, the Company maintains a flexible structure for one of its largest costs, compensation expense, by setting relatively low base salaries with bonuses that are tied to fund and Company performance. Thus, the Company's expense model somewhat expands and contracts with asset swings and performance.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company, with principal operations located in San Antonio, Texas, manages two business segments on a continuing operations basis:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Investment management services, through which the Company offers, to U.S. Global Investors Funds ( USGIF\u201d or the Fund(s)\u201d) and ETF clients, a range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Corporate investments, through which the Company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position.

The increase was primarily due to inflows into ETF clients, primarily the U.S. Global Jets ETF ( Jets ETF\u201d).\nDuring fiscal year 2021, average AUM was $3.4 billion compared to $699.5 million in fiscal year 2020, an increase of 379.3 percent. The increase was primarily due to inflows into the Jets ETF, resulting in an increase in assets which accelerated starting in the latter part of March 2020 and continued through fiscal year 2021. The Jets ETF invests in airline-related stocks, including global airline carriers, airport operators and aircraft manufacturers. While global financial markets have experienced volatility, including stocks in which the Jets ETF invests, this ETF has attracted inflows.\nThe following is a brief discussion of the Company's two business segments on a continuing operations basis.\nInvestment Management Services\nThe Company generates operating revenues from managing and servicing the Funds. The Company recorded advisory and administrative services fees from USGIF totaling approximately $4.5 million and $2.7 million in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. These revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management. Fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the Funds' asset levels, thereby affecting income and results of operations. Detailed information regarding the Funds managed by the Company within USGIF can be found on the Company's website, www.usfunds.com, including the prospectus and performance information for each fund. The mutual fund shareholders in USGIF are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the Funds, and the USGIF funds do not currently charge a redemption fee.\nInvestment base advisory fees from USGIF are calculated as a percentage of average net assets, ranging from 0.375 percent to 1.25 percent, and are paid monthly. The base advisory fee on the equity funds within USGIF is adjusted upward or downward based on performance. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company adjusted its base advisory fees upward (downward) by $482,000 and ($525,000), respectively. USGIF advisory fees in total, including performance adjustments, increased by approximately $1.8 million, or 68.1 percent, in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets under management driven by market appreciation in the equity funds and an increase in received performance fees.\nMutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management, which include:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>market appreciation or depreciation; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>the addition of new fund shareholder accounts; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>fund shareholder contributions of additional assets to existing accounts; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>withdrawals of assets from and termination of fund shareholder accounts; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables summarize the changes in assets under management for USGIF for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market appreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends and distributions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,243 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(401 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,644 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net shareholder purchases (redemptions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,669 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,835 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>433,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>509,222 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average investment management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.93 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.77 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average net assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>495,194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>334,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,605 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market appreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends and distributions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,973 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(984 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,957 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net shareholder redemptions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,600 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,789 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50,389 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average investment management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.96 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average net assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>322,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>409,024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs shown above, average assets under management for USGIF increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase in average assets under management in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to market appreciation in the equity funds. A significant portion of the dividends and distributions shown above are reinvested and included in net shareholder purchases (redemptions).\nPeriod-end assets in USGIF increased in total. The equity funds increased in net assets since the prior year-end, primarily due to market appreciation, while the fixed income funds declined mainly due to net shareholder redemptions.\nThe average annualized investment management fee rate (total advisory fees, excluding performance fees, as a percentage of average assets under management) was 77 basis points in fiscal year 2021 and 76 basis points in fiscal year 2020. The average investment management fee for equity funds in fiscal year 2021 and 2020 was 93 and 96 basis points, respectively. The average investment management fee for the fixed income funds was nil and 1 basis point for fiscal year 2021 and 2020, respectively. The low fee rate for the fixed income funds is due to voluntary fee waivers on these funds as discussed in Note 5, Investment Management and Other Fees, in the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company serves as investment advisor to two U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs): U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS) and U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (ticker GOAU). The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.60 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETFs. The Company also serves as investment advisor to one European-based ETF, the U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF. The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.65 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETF. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients totaling $17.1 million and $1.7 million in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively. As noted above, assets in both U.S.-based ETFs increased in fiscal year 2021, primarily in the Jets ETF. Information on the U.S.-based ETFs can be found at www.usglobaletfs.com, including the prospectus, performance and holdings. The ETFs' authorized participants are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the ETFs, and the ETFs do not charge a redemption fee. The U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF is not available to U.S. investors.\nCorporate Investments\nManagement believes it can more effectively manage the Company's cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the Company.\nThe following summarizes the cost, unrealized gain or loss, and fair value of investments carried at fair value as of June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020.\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> Securities at Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nin Investment Income (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Unrealized Gain (Loss) in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity securities at fair value 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,258 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale debt securities at fair value 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,049 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total at June 30, 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,307 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity securities at fair value 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,464 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,464 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total at June 30, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,464 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,464 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Changes in unrealized and realized gains and losses are included in earnings in the statement of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Realized gains and losses are included in earnings in the statement of operations.

A significant portion of the unrealized gains and losses is concentrated in a small number of issuers. For fiscal year 2021, the Company had total investment income of $28.3 million, compared to a $2.2 million investment loss in fiscal year 2020. Due to market volatility, the Company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future.\nA significant portion of the securities recorded at fair value in the above table is in investments in HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE\u201d), which were warrants and convertible debentures valued at $25.1 million at June 30, 2021, and common shares valued at $2.4 million at June 30, 2020. The investments in HIVE are discussed in more detail in Note 4, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. HIVE is a company that is headquartered and traded in Canada with cryptocurrency mining facilities in Iceland, Sweden, and Canada. Frank Holmes, CEO, is the non-executive chairman of HIVE. Effective August 31, 2018, Mr. Holmes was named Interim Executive Chairman of HIVE while a search for a new CEO is undertaken. Cryptocurrency markets and related stocks have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile, and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including speculative activity. Cryptocurrency mining companies face a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, environmental concerns, regulatory factors, and heightened risks of cybersecurity attacks for which there may be no source of recovery. There has been significant volatility in the market price of HIVE, which has materially impacted the investment's value included on the balance sheet, unrealized gain (loss) recognized in investment income (loss), and unrealized gain recognized in other comprehensive income.\nIn addition to the investments above, as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, the Company owned other investments of approximately $3.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, classified as securities without readily determinable fair values.\nThe Company also held an investment of approximately $532,000 and $158,000 as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively, accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This investment was in the Galileo New Economy Fund LP (previously known as Galileo Technology and Blockchain LP), a Canadian limited partnership managed by Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc. ( Galileo\u201d). Under the equity method, the Company's proportional share of the fund's net income or loss, which primarily consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments offset by fund expenses, is recognized in the Company's earnings. Income (loss) from equity method investments was $347,000 and ($142,000) for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. See further discussion on equity method investments in Note 4, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the Company and a detailed discussion of the Company's revenues and expenses.\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,464 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from Discontinued Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(338 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Net Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest from Discontinued Operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss Attributable from Discontinued Operations to U.S. Global Investors, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(220 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income (Loss) Attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,684 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average number of outstanding shares\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,067,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,108,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of dilutive securities:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee stock options\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,067,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,108,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings Per Share Attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic Net Income (Loss) per Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.30 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.01 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.31 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.30 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.01 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.31 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended June 30, 2021, Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2020\nThe Company posted net income attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc., as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, of $32.0 million ($2.12 per share) for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared with a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. of $4.7 million ($0.31 per share loss) for the year ended June 30, 2020, a positive change of approximately $36.6 million. The change is primarily due to operating income and realized and unrealized investment gains in the current year compared to operating loss and unrealized investment losses in the prior year, as discussed further below.\nOperating Revenues\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended June 30,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment advisory fees - USGIF:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gold and natural resources funds\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Emerging markets funds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(162 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.9 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity funds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Bond funds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66.7 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total investment advisory fees - USGIF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ETF advisory fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>882.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total advisory fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>397.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> USGIF administrative services fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Operating Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal consolidated operating revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021, increased $17.2 million, or 383.8 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Advisory fees increased by $17.1 million, or 397.4 percent, primarily as the result of higher ETF assets under management. Advisory fees are comprised of two components: a base management fee and a performance fee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Base management fees increased approximately $16.1 million. ETF unitary management fees increased due to an increase in ETF average assets under management, primarily in the Jets ETF. The Jets ETF invests in airline-related stocks, including global airline carriers, airport operators and aircraft manufacturers. Base fees for USGIF increased primarily as a result of higher average assets under management, primarily due to market appreciation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Performance fee adjustments for USGIF received in the current year were $482,000 compared to $525,000 paid out in the prior year, a positive change of $1.0 million. The USGIF performance fee, which applies to the equity funds only, is a fulcrum fee that is adjusted upwards or downwards by 0.25 percent when there is a performance difference of 5 percent or more between a fund's performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior rolling 12 months.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Administrative services fees increased by $44,000, or 26.7 percent, primarily as a result of higher net assets under management upon which these fees are based in the current period. These fees are paid by USGIF based on average daily net assets for administrative services provided by the Company to the Funds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdvisory Fees. Advisory fees, the largest component of the Company's operating revenues, are derived from two sources: USGIF advisory fees and exchange-traded fund advisory fees. In fiscal year 2021, these sources accounted for 19.9 percent and 79.1 percent, respectively, of the Company's operating revenues.\nInvestment base advisory fees from USGIF are calculated as a percentage of average net assets, ranging from 0.375 percent to 1.25 percent, and are paid monthly. The base advisory fee on the equity funds within USGIF is adjusted upward or downward based on performance. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company adjusted its base advisory fees upward (downward) by $482,000 and ($525,000), respectively. USGIF advisory fees in total, including performance adjustments, increased by approximately $1.8 million, or 68.1 percent, in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets under management driven by market appreciation in the equity funds and an increase in received performance fees.\nMutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management, which include:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>market appreciation or depreciation; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>the addition of new fund shareholder accounts; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>fund shareholder contributions of additional assets to existing accounts; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>withdrawals of assets from and termination of fund shareholder accounts; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company serves as investment advisor to two U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs): U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS) and U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (ticker GOAU). The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.60 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETFs. The Company also serves as investment advisor to one European-based ETF, the U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF. The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.65 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETF. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients of $17.1 million and $1.7 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to an increase in assets as discussed above.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended June 30,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.0 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating expenses increased $6.6 million, or 96.1 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits and general and administrative expenses, as described below.\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits. Employee compensation and benefits increased $4.5 million, or 159.5 percent, in fiscal year 2021, primarily as a result of increased bonuses related to realized investment gains and positive company and fund performance.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $2.0 million, or 55.7 percent, in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to higher ETF expenses and business development costs related to the increase in ETF assets.\nOther Income (Loss)\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended June 30,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,211 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1381.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from equity method investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(142 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on forgiveness of PPP loan\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Other Income (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,236 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1409.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal consolidated other income (loss) for the year ended June 30, 2021, had a positive change of $31.5 million, or 1,409.2 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2020.

The tax expense in the current period was primarily the result of operating income, realized gain on sale of securities, and unrealized gains on securities. The tax benefit in the prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in valuation of certain investments, which decreased the related deferred tax liability.\nThe Company and its non-Canadian subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. USCAN files a separate tax return in Canada. Provisions for income taxes include deferred taxes for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and tax purposes resulting from the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax amount will not be realized. A valuation allowance to fully reserve for the net operating loss carryforward, other carryovers and certain book/tax differences in the balance sheet is included in the net deferred tax balances in the amount of $2.8 million at June 30, 2020. There was no valuation allowance included at June 30, 2021. In assessing the valuation allowance, the Company considered, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations represents results of the Company's subsidiary Galileo, which was sold on March 2, 2020. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $338,000 for the year ended June 30, 2020. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information on this transaction and the results from Galileo operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of contractual obligations of the Company as of June 30, 2021, is as follows:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4-5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating leases consist of office equipment. Contractual obligations primarily consist of agreements for services used in daily operations and for marketing and distribution. Other contractual obligations not included in this table consist of agreements to waive or reduce fees and/or pay expenses on certain funds. Future obligations under these agreements are dependent upon future levels of fund assets.\nThe Board of Directors has authorized a monthly dividend of $0.0050 per share from July 2021 through September 2021. The total amount of cash dividends to be paid to class A and class C shareholders from July 2021 to September 2021 will be approximately $226,000, which is included as dividends payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2021. In September 2021, the Board authorized an increase in the monthly dividend to $0.0075 per share from October through December 2021, and in December 2021, the Board authorized the continuance of the monthly dividend of $0.0075 per share from January through March 2022, at which time it will be considered for continuation by the Board. Payment of cash dividends is within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and is dependent on earnings, operations, capital requirements, general financial condition of the Company, and general business conditions. The total amount of cash dividends expected to be paid to class A and class C shareholders from October 2021 through March 2022 is $676,000.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt June 30, 2021, the Company had net working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of approximately $21.6 million and a current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) of 5.2 to 1. With approximately $14.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $10.2 million in securities carried at fair value, excluding convertible securities, which together comprise approximately 39.6 percent of total assets, the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its current obligations. Total shareholders' equity was approximately $54.3 million.\nEffective April 12, 2020, the Company was approved for a loan of approximately $442,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d). The Company has under 25 employees and is considered a small business. The Company has been granted forgiveness of the entire PPP loan and any accrued interest.\nThe Company also has access to a $1 million credit facility, which can be utilized for working capital purposes. The credit agreement requires the Company to maintain certain covenants; the Company has been in compliance with these covenants during the current fiscal year. The credit agreement will expire on May 31, 2022, and the Company intends to renew annually. The credit facility is collateralized by approximately $1 million, included in restricted cash on the balance sheet, held in deposit in a money market account at the financial institution that provided the credit facility. As of June 30, 2021, this credit facility remained unutilized by the Company.\nInvestment advisory contracts pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and related affiliated contracts in the U.S., by law, may not exceed one year in length and, therefore, must be renewed at least annually after an initial two-year term. The investment advisory and related contracts between the Company and USGIF have been renewed through September 2022. The advisory agreement for the U.S.-based ETFs has been renewed through September 2022.\nThe primary cash requirements are for operating activities. The Company also uses cash to purchase investments, pay dividends and repurchase Company stock. The cash outlays for investments and dividend payments are discretionary and management or the Board may discontinue as deemed necessary. The stock repurchase plan is approved through December 31, 2021 but may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Cash and securities recorded at fair value, excluding convertible securities, of approximately $24.7 million are available to fund current activities.\nManagement believes current cash reserves, investments, and financing available will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs for operating activities.\nThe spread of the global COVID-19 outbreak and actions taken in response have affected the global and domestic economies and financial markets. Market declines affect the Company's assets under management, and thus its revenues and also the valuation of the Company's corporate investments. The Company cannot determine the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business. Should this emerging macro-economic risk continue for an extended period, there could be an adverse material financial impact to the Company's business and investments, including a material reduction in its results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. Management reviews these estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company believes the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to valuation of investments, income taxes, and valuation of stock-based compensation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: U.S. Global Investors (Bermuda) Limited ( USBERM\u201d), U.S. Global Investors (Canada) Limited ( USCAN\u201d) and U.S. Global Indices, LLC.\nUntil March 2, 2020, the Company, through USCAN, owned 65 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Galileo and represented controlling interest of Galileo. Galileo was consolidated with USCAN and the non-controlling interest in this subsidiary is included in non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThere are two primary consolidation models in U.S. GAAP, the variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) and voting interest entity models. The Company's evaluation for consolidation includes whether entities in which it has an interest or from which it receives fees are VIEs and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of any VIEs identified in its analysis. A VIE is an entity in which either (a) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support or (b) the group of holders of the equity investment at risk lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the obligation to absorb a majority of the expected losses or the right to receive the majority of the residual returns and consolidates the VIE on the basis of having a controlling financial interest.\nThe Company holds variable interests in but is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain funds it advises, specifically, certain funds in USGIF. The Company's interests in these VIEs consist of the Company's direct ownership therein and any fees earned but uncollected. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may choose to waive certain fees or assume operating expenses of the funds it advises for competitive, regulatory or contractual reasons (see Note 5 Investment Management and Other Fees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding fee waivers). The Company has not provided financial support to any of these entities outside the ordinary course of business. The Company's risk of loss with respect to these VIEs is limited to the carrying value of its investments in, and fees receivable from, the entities. The Company does not consolidate these VIEs because it is not the primary beneficiary.\nSince the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the above funds it advises, the Company evaluated if it should consolidate under the voting interest entity model. Under the voting interest model, for legal entities other than partnerships, the usual condition for control is ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares over an entity. The Company does not have control of any of the above funds it advises; therefore, the Company does not consolidate any of these funds.\nThe Company currently holds a variable interest in a fund organized as a limited partnership advised by Galileo, but this entity does not qualify as a VIE. Since it is not a VIE, the Company evaluated if it should consolidate it under the voting interest entity model. Under the voting interest model, for legal entities other than partnerships, the usual condition for control is ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares over an entity. The Company does not have control of the entity and, therefore, does not consolidate it. However, the Company was considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence. Thus, the investment has been accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nInvestments. The Company records security transactions on trade date. Realized gains (losses) from security transactions are calculated on the first-in/first-out cost basis, unless otherwise identifiable, and are recorded in earnings on the date of sale.\nInvestments in Equity Securities. Equity securities are generally carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value recorded through earnings within investment income (loss).\nInvestments in Debt Securities. The Company classifies debt investments as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity based on the Company's intent to sell the security or, its intent and ability to hold the debt security to maturity. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, and changes in unrealized gains and losses are reported net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income, except for declines in fair value determined to be other than temporary, which are reported in earnings. Upon the disposition of an available-for-sale security, the Company reclassifies the unrealized gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to investment income (loss). Held-to-maturity debt securities are purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized cost.\nEmbedded derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives for trading, speculation, or hedging exposures. Certain financial instruments the Company invests in contain both a derivative and a non-derivative component. In such cases, the derivative component is termed an embedded derivative, with the non-derivative component representing the host contract. If the economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, and the changes in the fair value of the host contact itself is not recorded through earnings within investment income (loss), the embedded derivative is bifurcated and carried at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded through earnings within investment income (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The host contract will continue to be accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting standard. The embedded derivative and the related host contract represent one legal contract and are combined on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and tables within Note 4 Investments, unless otherwise indicated.\nOther Investments. Other investments consist of equity investments in entities over which the Company is unable to exercise significant influence and which do not have readily determinable fair values. For these securities, the Company generally elects to value using the measurement alternative, under which such securities will be measured at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes for identical or similar securities of the same issuer with such changes recorded in investment income (loss).\nEquity Method Investments. Investments classified as equity method consist of investments in companies in which the Company is able to exercise significant influence but not control. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is initially recorded at cost, then the Company's proportional share of investee's underlying net income or loss is recorded as a component of other income\u201d with a corresponding increase or decrease to the carrying value of the investment. Distributions received from the investee reduce the Company's carrying value of the investment. These investments are evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances arise that indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The financial instruments of the Company are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at market or fair values or at carrying amounts that approximate fair values.\nNon-Controlling Interests. The Company reports non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d as equity, separate from parent's equity, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations includes net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award's vesting period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe Company believes that the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes. The Company's annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in its U.S. and non-U.S. entities which are part of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions.\nTax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on the Company's consolidated tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates.\nThe Company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Judgment is used to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return. These liabilities are adjusted, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\nThe Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.\nAssessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nForeign Exchange. The balance sheets of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company and certain foreign-denominated investment products are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period and the related income or loss is translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. Net exchange gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translations of foreign subsidiaries are excluded from income and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net exchange gains and losses resulting from income or loss translations are included in income and are recorded in investment income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investment transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and any related gain or loss is included in investment income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. See information regarding accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Company in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report discusses the consolidated results of operations of U.S. Global Investors, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated results of operations of U.S. Global Investors, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, U.S. Global\u201d or the Company\u201d) for the past two fiscal years and other factors that may affect future financial performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Trends in Financial Markets\nThe Company's operating revenues are highly correlated to the level of assets under management ( AUM\u201d) and fees associated with various investment products. While AUM is directly impacted by changes in the financial markets, it is also impacted by cash inflows or outflows due to shareholder activity. Performance fees on certain equity fund products may also impact revenues, either positively or negatively. Various products may have different fees, so changes in our product mix may also affect revenues. For example, international equity products will generally have a higher fee than fixed income products, so changes in assets in those products will have a larger impact on revenues.\nWhile products are offered for a wide variety of markets, the Company has traditionally focused on gold mining and exploration, natural resources, and emerging markets. More recently the airline industry has become more significant to our revenue. All these markets are volatile and subject to capital cycles.\nWith a widespread roll out of the various COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, the economy began to open back up with travel and office work returning to a new normal. Energy demand picked up significantly with crude oil prices approaching an 80 percent gain for the trailing year. Travel and luxury goods rebounded with airlines rising nearly 45 percent and luxury goods companies up 56 percent. There was broad strength across the industrial metals, and copper rose 55 percent for the trailing year. For precious metals, silver was the leader, up 44 percent, followed closely by palladium at 43 percent. Platinum gained 30 percent, after a slightly negative return in the prior year. Spot gold finished the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, at $1,770.11, down less than 1 percent from June 30, 2020. Rising interest rates across the longer end of the yield curve were a headwind to gold with the yield on the 10-year U.S. government note rising to 1.47 percent from a low of 0.66 percent a year earlier. The pick-up in yield, however, was not accompanied by any changes in the Federal Funds Target Rate with the upper bound remaining set at 0.25 percent.\nThe Company's emerging markets products had positive gains but only about half the gains that U.S. equity markets experienced, which was largely a function of how well various regions contained the virus through vaccinations. Eastern European markets gained about 22 percent compared to the S&P 500's gain of 41 percent. Trade tensions still exist between the U.S. and China despite the change in presidential power, and President Biden has been slow to relax many of the trade barriers erected against China. Many regions in the world, including the U.S., have pockets of unvaccinated people, which is allowing the Delta variant of COVID-19 to potentially mutate again.\nComing out of the virus lockdown, GDP growth in the U.S. has been robust, averaging high signal digits the last 3 quarters. This has triggered some renewed inflation concerns with some materials like lumber, the reduced availability of which has led to skyrocketing prices for this commodity amid strong demand for housing. The current thinking by the Fed on inflation is that it will be transitory. Civil and political unrest peaked with the storming of the nation's capital as the Senate was voting to confirm Joe Biden as the next President of the United States of America. Expanded social services are a priority of the new administration that will be funded through taxes at a time when there is great political stress. Modern Monetary Theory continues to reverberate in the news. We would expect the U.S. dollar to decline in value with more deficit spending, perhaps prompting investor to seek inflation protection through precious metals and other commodities.\nIn addition to its gold, natural resources and emerging markets funds, the Company has global equity and domestic fixed income funds. While these products do not drive the Company's profitability as much as the more specialized products, they provide an opportunity to offer shareholders diversification and less volatility than the niche markets.\nMutual funds in general continued to see outflows compared to other investment alternatives, including ETFs. The Company has two ETF products listed on the New York Stock Exchange: the U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS), which concentrates on the U.S. and international airline industry, and the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (ticker GOAU), which invests in companies engaged in the production of precious metals either through active (mining or production) or passive (owning royalties or production streams) means. The Company has one European-based ETF product listed on various exchanges in Europe, the U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF (ticker JETS), which concentrates on the U.S. and international airline industry.\nThe spread of the global COVID-19 outbreak and actions taken in response have affected the global and domestic economies and financial markets. Market declines affect the Company's assets under management, and thus its revenues and also the valuation of the Company's corporate investments. The Company cannot determine the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business. Should this emerging macro-economic risk continue for an extended period, there could be an adverse material financial impact to the Company's business and investments, including a material reduction in its results of operations.\nCOVID-19-related circumstances (e.g., remote work arrangements) have not adversely affected the Company's ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures.\nAssets in the U.S. Global Jets ETF ( Jets ETF\u201d) (ticker JETS) started to accelerate in the latter part of March 2020 and continued through fiscal year 2021. Assets in the Jets ETF were $3.6 billion and $1.2 billion at June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Jets ETF invests in airline-related stocks, including global airline carriers, airport operators and aircraft manufacturers. While global financial markets have experienced volatility, including stocks in which the Jets ETF invests, this ETF has attracted inflows.\nTo manage expenses, the Company maintains a flexible structure for one of its largest costs, compensation expense, by setting relatively low base salaries with bonuses that are tied to fund and Company performance. Thus, the Company's expense model somewhat expands and contracts with asset swings and performance.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company, with principal operations located in San Antonio, Texas, manages two business segments on a continuing operations basis:\n 1. Investment management services, through which the Company offers, to U.S. Global Investors Funds ( USGIF\u201d or the Fund(s)\u201d) and ETF clients, a range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors; and \n 2. Corporate investments, through which the Company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position. The Company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments. \n\nOn June 30, 2021, total AUM as of period end was $4.2 billion compared to $1.7 billion on June 30, 2020, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 146.8 percent. The increase was primarily due to inflows into ETF clients, primarily the U.S. Global Jets ETF ( Jets ETF\u201d).\nDuring fiscal year 2021, average AUM was $3.4 billion compared to $699.5 million in fiscal year 2020, an increase of 379.3 percent. The increase was primarily due to inflows into the Jets ETF, resulting in an increase in assets which accelerated starting in the latter part of March 2020 and continued through fiscal year 2021. The Jets ETF invests in airline-related stocks, including global airline carriers, airport operators and aircraft manufacturers. While global financial markets have experienced volatility, including stocks in which the Jets ETF invests, this ETF has attracted inflows.\nThe following is a brief discussion of the Company's two business segments on a continuing operations basis.\nInvestment Management Services\nThe Company generates operating revenues from managing and servicing the Funds. The Company recorded advisory and administrative services fees from USGIF totaling approximately $4.5 million and $2.7 million in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. These revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management. Fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the Funds' asset levels, thereby affecting income and results of operations. Detailed information regarding the Funds managed by the Company within USGIF can be found on the Company's website, www.usfunds.com, including the prospectus and performance information for each fund. The mutual fund shareholders in USGIF are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the Funds, and the USGIF funds do not currently charge a redemption fee.\nInvestment base advisory fees from USGIF are calculated as a percentage of average net assets, ranging from 0.375 percent to 1.25 percent, and are paid monthly. The base advisory fee on the equity funds within USGIF is adjusted upward or downward based on performance. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company adjusted its base advisory fees upward (downward) by $482,000 and ($525,000), respectively. USGIF advisory fees in total, including performance adjustments, increased by approximately $1.8 million, or 68.1 percent, in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets under management driven by market appreciation in the equity funds and an increase in received performance fees.\nMutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management, which include:\n \u25cf market appreciation or depreciation; \n \u25cf the addition of new fund shareholder accounts; \n \u25cf fund shareholder contributions of additional assets to existing accounts; \n \u25cf withdrawals of assets from and termination of fund shareholder accounts; \n \u25cf exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures; and \n \u25cf the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed. \nThe following tables summarize the changes in assets under management for USGIF for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\n\nAs shown above, average assets under management for USGIF increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase in average assets under management in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to market appreciation in the equity funds. A significant portion of the dividends and distributions shown above are reinvested and included in net shareholder purchases (redemptions).\nPeriod-end assets in USGIF increased in total. The equity funds increased in net assets since the prior year-end, primarily due to market appreciation, while the fixed income funds declined mainly due to net shareholder redemptions.\nThe average annualized investment management fee rate (total advisory fees, excluding performance fees, as a percentage of average assets under management) was 77 basis points in fiscal year 2021 and 76 basis points in fiscal year 2020. The average investment management fee for equity funds in fiscal year 2021 and 2020 was 93 and 96 basis points, respectively. The average investment management fee for the fixed income funds was nil and 1 basis point for fiscal year 2021 and 2020, respectively. The low fee rate for the fixed income funds is due to voluntary fee waivers on these funds as discussed in Note 5, Investment Management and Other Fees, in the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company serves as investment advisor to two U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs): U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS) and U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (ticker GOAU). The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.60 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETFs. The Company also serves as investment advisor to one European-based ETF, the U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF. The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.65 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETF. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients totaling $17.1 million and $1.7 million in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively. As noted above, assets in both U.S.-based ETFs increased in fiscal year 2021, primarily in the Jets ETF. Information on the U.S.-based ETFs can be found at www.usglobaletfs.com, including the prospectus, performance and holdings. The ETFs' authorized participants are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the ETFs, and the ETFs do not charge a redemption fee. The U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF is not available to U.S. investors.\nCorporate Investments\nManagement believes it can more effectively manage the Company's cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the Company.\nThe following summarizes the cost, unrealized gain or loss, and fair value of investments carried at fair value as of June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020.\n\n 1. Changes in unrealized and realized gains and losses are included in earnings in the statement of operations. \n 2. Realized gains and losses are included in earnings in the statement of operations. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are included in the statement of comprehensive income (loss), except for declines in fair value determined to be other than temporary, and amounts attributable to embedded derivatives, which are included in earnings in the statement of operations. An embedded derivative and its related host contract represent one legal contract and are combined within the investments in available-for-sale debt securities on the consolidated balance sheets. \nThe investments shown above include investments at fair value of $7.3 million and $7.0 million, as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively, invested in USGIF funds the Company advised.\nInvestment income (loss) from the Company's investments includes:\n \u25cf realized gains and losses on sales of securities; \n \u25cf realized gains and losses on principal payment proceeds; \n \u25cf unrealized gains and losses on fair valued securities; \n \u25cf realized foreign currency gains and losses; \n \u25cf realized gains and losses on sale of subsidiary; \n \u25cf impairments and observable price changes on equity investments without readily determinable fair values; and \n \u25cf dividend and interest income. \nInvestment income can be volatile and may vary depending on market fluctuations, the Company's ability to participate in investment opportunities, and timing of transactions. A significant portion of the unrealized gains and losses is concentrated in a small number of issuers. For fiscal year 2021, the Company had total investment income of $28.3 million, compared to a $2.2 million investment loss in fiscal year 2020. Due to market volatility, the Company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future.\nA significant portion of the securities recorded at fair value in the above table is in investments in HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE\u201d), which were warrants and convertible debentures valued at $25.1 million at June 30, 2021, and common shares valued at $2.4 million at June 30, 2020. The investments in HIVE are discussed in more detail in Note 4, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. HIVE is a company that is headquartered and traded in Canada with cryptocurrency mining facilities in Iceland, Sweden, and Canada. Frank Holmes, CEO, is the non-executive chairman of HIVE. Effective August 31, 2018, Mr. Holmes was named Interim Executive Chairman of HIVE while a search for a new CEO is undertaken. Cryptocurrency markets and related stocks have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile, and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including speculative activity. Cryptocurrency mining companies face a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, environmental concerns, regulatory factors, and heightened risks of cybersecurity attacks for which there may be no source of recovery. There has been significant volatility in the market price of HIVE, which has materially impacted the investment's value included on the balance sheet, unrealized gain (loss) recognized in investment income (loss), and unrealized gain recognized in other comprehensive income.\nIn addition to the investments above, as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, the Company owned other investments of approximately $3.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, classified as securities without readily determinable fair values.\nThe Company also held an investment of approximately $532,000 and $158,000 as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively, accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This investment was in the Galileo New Economy Fund LP (previously known as Galileo Technology and Blockchain LP), a Canadian limited partnership managed by Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc. ( Galileo\u201d). Under the equity method, the Company's proportional share of the fund's net income or loss, which primarily consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments offset by fund expenses, is recognized in the Company's earnings. Income (loss) from equity method investments was $347,000 and ($142,000) for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. See further discussion on equity method investments in Note 4, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the Company and a detailed discussion of the Company's revenues and expenses.\n\nYear Ended June 30, 2021, Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2020\nThe Company posted net income attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc., as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, of $32.0 million ($2.12 per share) for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared with a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. of $4.7 million ($0.31 per share loss) for the year ended June 30, 2020, a positive change of approximately $36.6 million. The change is primarily due to operating income and realized and unrealized investment gains in the current year compared to operating loss and unrealized investment losses in the prior year, as discussed further below.\nOperating Revenues\n\nTotal consolidated operating revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021, increased $17.2 million, or 383.8 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2020.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated results of operations of U.S. Global Investors, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, U.S. Global\u201d or the Company\u201d) for the past two fiscal years and other factors that may affect future financial performance.

Corporate investments, through which the Company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position. The Company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments. \nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> Assets Under Management ( AUM\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June 30, 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> June 30, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Management Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> USGIF\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>509,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ETF Clients\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,720,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,287,851 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total AUM\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,229,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,713,748 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn June 30, 2021, total AUM as of period end was $4.2 billion compared to $1.7 billion on June 30, 2020, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 146.8 percent.

While global financial markets have experienced volatility, including stocks in which the Jets ETF invests, this ETF has attracted inflows.\nThe following is a brief discussion of the Company's two business segments on a continuing operations basis.\nInvestment Management Services\nThe Company generates operating revenues from managing and servicing the Funds. The Company recorded advisory and administrative services fees from USGIF totaling approximately $4.5 million and $2.7 million in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. These revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management. Fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the Funds' asset levels, thereby affecting income and results of operations. Detailed information regarding the Funds managed by the Company within USGIF can be found on the Company's website, www.usfunds.com, including the prospectus and performance information for each fund. The mutual fund shareholders in USGIF are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the Funds, and the USGIF funds do not currently charge a redemption fee.\nInvestment base advisory fees from USGIF are calculated as a percentage of average net assets, ranging from 0.375 percent to 1.25 percent, and are paid monthly. The base advisory fee on the equity funds within USGIF is adjusted upward or downward based on performance. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company adjusted its base advisory fees upward (downward) by $482,000 and ($525,000), respectively. USGIF advisory fees in total, including performance adjustments, increased by approximately $1.8 million, or 68.1 percent, in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets under management driven by market appreciation in the equity funds and an increase in received performance fees.\nMutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management, which include:\n \u25cf market appreciation or depreciation; \n \u25cf the addition of new fund shareholder accounts; \n \u25cf fund shareholder contributions of additional assets to existing accounts; \n \u25cf withdrawals of assets from and termination of fund shareholder accounts; \n \u25cf exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures; and \n \u25cf the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed. \nThe following tables summarize the changes in assets under management for USGIF for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market appreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101,804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends and distributions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,243 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(401 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,644 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net shareholder purchases (redemptions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,669 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,835 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>433,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>509,222 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average investment management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.93 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.77 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average net assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>495,194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>334,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,605 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market appreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends and distributions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,973 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(984 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,957 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net shareholder redemptions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,600 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,789 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50,389 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average investment management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.96 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average net assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>322,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>409,024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs shown above, average assets under management for USGIF increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase in average assets under management in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to market appreciation in the equity funds. A significant portion of the dividends and distributions shown above are reinvested and included in net shareholder purchases (redemptions).\nPeriod-end assets in USGIF increased in total. The equity funds increased in net assets since the prior year-end, primarily due to market appreciation, while the fixed income funds declined mainly due to net shareholder redemptions.\nThe average annualized investment management fee rate (total advisory fees, excluding performance fees, as a percentage of average assets under management) was 77 basis points in fiscal year 2021 and 76 basis points in fiscal year 2020. The average investment management fee for equity funds in fiscal year 2021 and 2020 was 93 and 96 basis points, respectively. The average investment management fee for the fixed income funds was nil and 1 basis point for fiscal year 2021 and 2020, respectively. The low fee rate for the fixed income funds is due to voluntary fee waivers on these funds as discussed in Note 5, Investment Management and Other Fees, in the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company serves as investment advisor to two U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs): U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS) and U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (ticker GOAU). The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.60 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETFs. The Company also serves as investment advisor to one European-based ETF, the U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF. The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.65 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETF. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients totaling $17.1 million and $1.7 million in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively. As noted above, assets in both U.S.-based ETFs increased in fiscal year 2021, primarily in the Jets ETF. Information on the U.S.-based ETFs can be found at www.usglobaletfs.com, including the prospectus, performance and holdings. The ETFs' authorized participants are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the ETFs, and the ETFs do not charge a redemption fee. The U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF is not available to U.S. investors.\nCorporate Investments\nManagement believes it can more effectively manage the Company's cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the Company.\nThe following summarizes the cost, unrealized gain or loss, and fair value of investments carried at fair value as of June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020.\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> Securities at Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nin Investment Income (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Unrealized Gain (Loss) in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity securities at fair value 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,258 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale debt securities at fair value 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,049 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total at June 30, 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,307 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity securities at fair value 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,464 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,464 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total at June 30, 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,928 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,464 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,464 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1. Changes in unrealized and realized gains and losses are included in earnings in the statement of operations. \n 2. Realized gains and losses are included in earnings in the statement of operations. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are included in the statement of comprehensive income (loss), except for declines in fair value determined to be other than temporary, and amounts attributable to embedded derivatives, which are included in earnings in the statement of operations. An embedded derivative and its related host contract represent one legal contract and are combined within the investments in available-for-sale debt securities on the consolidated balance sheets. \nThe investments shown above include investments at fair value of $7.3 million and $7.0 million, as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively, invested in USGIF funds the Company advised.\nInvestment income (loss) from the Company's investments includes:\n \u25cf realized gains and losses on sales of securities; \n \u25cf realized gains and losses on principal payment proceeds; \n \u25cf unrealized gains and losses on fair valued securities; \n \u25cf realized foreign currency gains and losses; \n \u25cf realized gains and losses on sale of subsidiary; \n \u25cf impairments and observable price changes on equity investments without readily determinable fair values; and \n \u25cf dividend and interest income. \nInvestment income can be volatile and may vary depending on market fluctuations, the Company's ability to participate in investment opportunities, and timing of transactions. A significant portion of the unrealized gains and losses is concentrated in a small number of issuers. For fiscal year 2021, the Company had total investment income of $28.3 million, compared to a $2.2 million investment loss in fiscal year 2020. Due to market volatility, the Company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future.\nA significant portion of the securities recorded at fair value in the above table is in investments in HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE\u201d), which were warrants and convertible debentures valued at $25.1 million at June 30, 2021, and common shares valued at $2.4 million at June 30, 2020. The investments in HIVE are discussed in more detail in Note 4, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. HIVE is a company that is headquartered and traded in Canada with cryptocurrency mining facilities in Iceland, Sweden, and Canada. Frank Holmes, CEO, is the non-executive chairman of HIVE. Effective August 31, 2018, Mr. Holmes was named Interim Executive Chairman of HIVE while a search for a new CEO is undertaken. Cryptocurrency markets and related stocks have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile, and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including speculative activity. Cryptocurrency mining companies face a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, environmental concerns, regulatory factors, and heightened risks of cybersecurity attacks for which there may be no source of recovery. There has been significant volatility in the market price of HIVE, which has materially impacted the investment's value included on the balance sheet, unrealized gain (loss) recognized in investment income (loss), and unrealized gain recognized in other comprehensive income.\nIn addition to the investments above, as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, the Company owned other investments of approximately $3.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, classified as securities without readily determinable fair values.\nThe Company also held an investment of approximately $532,000 and $158,000 as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively, accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This investment was in the Galileo New Economy Fund LP (previously known as Galileo Technology and Blockchain LP), a Canadian limited partnership managed by Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc. ( Galileo\u201d). Under the equity method, the Company's proportional share of the fund's net income or loss, which primarily consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments offset by fund expenses, is recognized in the Company's earnings. Income (loss) from equity method investments was $347,000 and ($142,000) for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
