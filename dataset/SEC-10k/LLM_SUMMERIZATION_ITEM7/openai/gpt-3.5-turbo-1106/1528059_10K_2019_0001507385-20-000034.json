Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d Certain risks may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this report entitled Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nVEREIT is a full-service real estate operating company which owns and manages one of the largest portfolios of single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S. The Company has 3,858 retail, restaurant, office and industrial operating properties with an aggregate 89.5 million rentable square feet, of which 99.1% was leased as of December 31, 2019, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 8.3 years.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different assumptions or estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn connection with prior mergers, we recorded goodwill as a result of the merger consideration exceeding the net assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. As part of the annual qualitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of each year, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying value including, but not limited to, the following:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for an entity's products or services, or a regulatory or political development.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; contemplation of bankruptcy; or litigation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sustained decrease in share price (both in absolute terms and relative to peers).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe performed the annual qualitative assessment for goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2019. As a result of the qualitative analysis, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is greater than the carrying value. As such, no further testing was performed.\nReal Estate Investment Impairment\nWe invest in real estate assets and subsequently monitor those investments quarterly for impairment, including the review of real estate properties subject to direct financing leases. Additionally, we record depreciation and amortization related to our investments. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to real estate investments include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets affect the amount of depreciation and amortization recognized on our investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The review of impairment indicators and subsequent determination of the undiscounted future cash flows could require us to reduce the value of assets and recognize an impairment loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The fair value of held for sale assets is estimated by management.

Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets consist of above- and below- market lease values and the value of in-place leases. Our purchase price allocations are developed utilizing third-party appraisal reports, industry standards and management experience. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to purchase price allocations include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The value allocated to land as opposed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements affects the amount of depreciation expense we record. If more value is attributed to land, depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Intangible lease assets and liabilities can be significantly affected by estimates, including market rent, lease term including renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates, carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease-up period, and current market conditions and costs, including tenant improvement allowances and rent concessions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We determine whether any financing assumed is above- or below- market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar investment properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Highlights and Key Performance Indicators\n2019 Activity\nOperations\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Acquired controlling financial interests in 66 commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of $403.6 million, which includes $2.3 million of external acquisition-related expenses that were capitalized.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Disposed of 201 properties, including the sale of six consolidated properties to the Industrial Partnership and one property sold through a foreclosure, for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.2 billion, of which the Company's share was $1.1 billion, resulting in proceeds of $1.1 billion after closing costs.

The increase was primarily due to a $587.0 million increase in litigation settlement costs to $820.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $233.2 million during the same period 2018, which related to litigation filed as a result of the findings of the Audit Committee Investigation. This increase was offset by $48.4 million of insurance recoveries received pursuant to a settlement and release agreement with certain insurance carriers, related to litigation filed as a result of the findings of the Audit Committee Investigation and $26.5 million of other recoveries related to the surrender of Limited Partner OP Units by the Former Manager and certain of its principals as described in Note 12 - Equity.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, ground rent and maintenance include both reimbursable and non-reimbursable property expenses. The increase in property operating expenses of $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to additional reimbursable ground rent recorded in conjunction with the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 842, Leases ( ASC 842\u201d) on January 1, 2019 and an increase in reimbursable operating expenses, offset by the net impact of property dispositions and acquisitions.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses of $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in insurance expenses and bank fees.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of $158.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to furniture and fixtures that were fully depreciated during 2018, as they had reached the end of their useful lives, and real estate dispositions, partially offset by real estate acquisitions.\nImpairments\nImpairments of $47.1 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 relate to certain office, retail and restaurant properties that, during 2019, management identified for potential sale or determined, based on discussions with the current tenants, would not be re-leased by the tenant and the Company believes the property will not be leased to another tenant at a rental rate that supports the current book value.\nRestructuring Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $10.5 million of restructuring expenses related to the reorganization of the business after the sale of its investment management segment, Cole Capital, and cessation of services performed pursuant to the Services Agreement.\nOther Income, Provision for Income Taxes and Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain financial information and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 vs 2018\nIncrease/(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(278,574\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(280,887\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) gain on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,910\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,270\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,119\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income and gain on disposition of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposition of real estate and real estate assets held for sale, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>198,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,101\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>839\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,695\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\nThe decrease in interest expense of $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding.\n(Loss) Gain on Extinguishment and Forgiveness of Debt, Net\nThe loss on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net was $17.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the gain on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net of $5.4 million for the same period in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized losses on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of $400.0 million of the 2021 Senior Notes, prepayments of mortgage notes payable, and the repurchase of $80.7 million of the 2020 Convertible Notes, offset by a gain on the foreclosure sale of one property. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a gain related to one deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction with the lender of a mortgage loan, which was secured by one property.\nOther Income, Net\nThe decrease in other income, net of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to a $5.1 million gain in 2018 from measuring the Company's investments in Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc. ( CCIT II\u201d), Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. ( CCIT III\u201d) and Cole Credit Property Trust V, Inc. ( CCPT V\u201d) at fair value after the investments were no longer accounted for using the equity method and a $4.8 million payment received in 2018 related to a fully reserved loan receivable recorded in other income, offset by $4.2 million of payments received in 2019 related to the Company's bankruptcy claims related to two prior tenants and a $2.2 million loss in 2018 related to the sale of six commercial mortgage-backed securities.\nEquity in Income and Gain on Disposition of Unconsolidated Entities\nThe increase in equity in income and gain on disposition of unconsolidated entities of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to the Company's investment in the Industrial Partnership.\nGain on Disposition of Real Estate and Real Estate Assets Held for Sale, Net\nThe increase in gain on disposition of real estate and real estate assets held for sale, net of $198.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, was due to the Company's disposition of 200 properties, excluding one property conveyed to a lender in a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction, for an aggregate sales price of $1.2 billion which resulted in a gain of $293.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the disposition of 148 properties, excluding one property conveyed to a lender in a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction, for an aggregate sales price of $526.4 million during the same period in 2018, which resulted in a gain of $96.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company also recognized a loss of $1.3 million related to assets classified as held for sale, as compared to a loss of $1.9 million during the same period in 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of certain state, local and federal income and franchise taxes.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes\nThe change in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes of $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to the completion of the sale of the company's investment management segment, Cole Capital, on February 1, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also disclose certain non-GAAP measures, as discussed further below. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in our internal analysis of results and believes these measures are useful to investors for the reasons explained below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( Nareit\u201d), an industry trade group, has promulgated a supplemental performance measure known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under U.S. GAAP.\nNareit defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP adjusted for gains or losses from disposition of property, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment write-downs on real estate, and our pro rata share of FFO adjustments related to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We calculate FFO in accordance with Nareit's definition described above.\nIn addition to FFO, we use adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d) as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. AFFO, as defined by the Company, excludes from FFO non-routine items such as acquisition-related expenses, litigation and non-routine costs, net, loss on disposition of discontinued operations, net revenue or expense earned or incurred that is related to the Services Agreement, gains or losses on sale of investment securities or mortgage notes receivable, payments on fully reserved loan receivables and restructuring expenses. We also exclude certain non-cash items such as impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, straight-line rent, net of bad debt expense related to straight-line rent, net direct financing lease adjustments, gains or losses on derivatives, reserves for loan loss, gains or losses on the extinguishment or forgiveness of debt, non-current portion of the tax benefit or expense, equity-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, deferred financing costs, premiums and discounts on debt and investments, above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities. We omit the impact of the Excluded Properties and related non-recourse mortgage notes from FFO to calculate AFFO. Management believes that excluding these costs from FFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management, and provides investors a view of the performance of our portfolio over time. AFFO allows for a comparison of the performance of our operations with other publicly-traded REITs, as AFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by publicly-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes.\nFor all of these reasons, we believe FFO and AFFO, in addition to net income (loss), as defined by U.S. GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful in understanding the various ways in which our management evaluates the performance of the Company over time. However, not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs. Neither the SEC, Nareit, nor any other regulatory body has evaluated the acceptability of the exclusions used to adjust FFO in order to calculate AFFO and its use as a non-GAAP financial performance measure.\nThe table below presents FFO and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except share and per share data) and includes both continuing operations, which primarily represent the Company's real estate operations, and discontinued operations, which represent substantially all of Cole Capital.

The Company contributed the net proceeds from the Offering to the OP in exchange for additional General Partner OP Units, which have substantially identical economic terms as the Company's common stock. Subsequent to September 30, 2019, the net proceeds of the Offering were used to pay amounts owed in connection with the settlement of certain litigation, as described in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies, and for general corporate purposes.\nCommon Stock Continuous Offering Programs\nOn September 19, 2016, the Company registered the Prior Program pursuant to which the Company could offer and sell, from time to time, in at-the-market\u201d offerings or certain other transactions, shares of Common Stock with an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750.0 million, through its sales agents. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had issued 5.0 million shares under the Prior Program, at a weighted average price per share of $8.42, for gross proceeds of $42.5 million. The weighted average price per share, net of offering costs, was $8.30, for net proceeds of $41.8 million. The proceeds from the sale of shares were used for general corporate purposes, including funding potential acquisitions and repurchasing or repaying outstanding indebtedness.\nOn April 15, 2019, the Company established the Current ATM Program, a new continuous equity offering program pursuant to which the Company may sell shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $750.0 million from time to time through April 15, 2022 in at-the-market\u201d offerings or certain other transactions. The Current ATM Program replaced the Prior Program. The proceeds from any sale of shares under the Current ATM Program have been or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding potential acquisitions and repurchasing or repaying outstanding indebtedness. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had issued 9.0 million shares under the Current ATM Program, at a weighted average price per share of $9.60, for gross proceeds of $86.7 million. The weighted average price per share, net of offering costs, was $9.46, for net proceeds of $85.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $663.3 million available to be sold under the Current ATM Program.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nOn May 3, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors terminated its 2018 Share Repurchase Program that permitted the Company to repurchase up to $200.0 million of its outstanding Common Stock through May 3, 2019, as market conditions warranted. On May 6, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the 2019 Share Repurchase Program that permits the Company to repurchase up to $200.0 million of its outstanding Common Stock through May 6, 2022. Under the share repurchase programs, repurchases can be made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, structured or derivative transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase transactions, or other methods of acquiring shares in accordance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at a specific time or in a specific situation and repurchases are influenced by prevailing market conditions, the trading price of the\nCommon Stock, the Company's financial performance and other conditions. Shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company under the share repurchase programs, if any, will be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock.\nThere were no share repurchases under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program or 2019 Share Repurchase Program during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $200.0 million available for share repurchases under the 2019 Share Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 0.8 million shares of Common Stock in multiple open market transactions, at a weighted average share price of $6.95 for an aggregate purchase price of $5.6 million under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program.\nSeries F Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred OP Units\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company redeemed a total of 12.0 million shares of Series F Preferred Stock, representing approximately 28.02% of the issued and outstanding preferred shares as of the beginning of the year. The shares of Series F Preferred Stock were redeemed at a redemption price of $25.00 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 30.9 million shares of Series F Preferred Stock, approximately 30.9 million corresponding General Partner Series F Preferred Units and 49,766 Limited Partner Series F Preferred Units issued and outstanding.\nDisposition Activity\nAs part of our effort to optimize our real estate portfolio by focusing on holding core assets, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company disposed of 201 properties, including the sale of six consolidated properties to the Industrial Partnership and one property sold through a foreclosure, for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.2 billion, of which our share was $1.1 billion, resulting in proceeds of $1.1 billion after closing costs and contributions to the Industrial Partnership. We expect to continue to explore opportunities to sell additional properties to provide us further financial flexibility and to fund property acquisitions.\nCredit Facility\nSummary and Obligations\nOn May 23, 2018, the Company, as guarantor, and the Operating Partnership, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto that allows for maximum borrowings of $2.9 billion, originally consisting of a $2.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $900.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan. Effective December 27, 2019, the Company reduced its Revolving Credit Facility capacity from $2.0 billion to $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2019, $150.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the full $900.0 million was drawn on the Credit Facility Term Loan. The maximum aggregate dollar amount of letters of credit that may be outstanding at any one time under the Credit Facility is $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, letters of credit outstanding were $3.9 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, all letters of credit outstanding were terminated.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility generally bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 0.775% to 1.55% or Base Rate plus 0.00% to 0.55% (based upon our then current credit rating). Base Rate\u201d is defined as the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or a floating rate based on one month LIBOR plus 1.0%, determined on a daily basis. The Credit Facility Term Loan generally bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 0.85% to 1.75%, or Base Rate plus 0.00% to 0.75% (based upon our then current credit rating). In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the flexibility for interest rate auctions, pursuant to which, at the Company's election, the Company may request that lenders make competitive bids to provide revolving loans, which competitive bids may be at pricing levels that differ from the foregoing interest rates.\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe Credit Facility requires restrictions on corporate guarantees, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. The key financial covenants in the Credit Facility, as defined and calculated per the terms of the Credit Agreement include maintaining the following:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Credit Facility Key Covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 60%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 1.5x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 45%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 60%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of unencumbered adjusted NOI to unsecured interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 1.75x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company believes that it was in compliance with the financial covenants pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is not restricted from accessing any borrowing availability under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019.\nCorporate Bonds\nSummary and Obligations\nOn February 6, 2019, the Company's 2019 Senior Notes matured and the principal outstanding balance of $750.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was repaid, utilizing borrowings under the Credit Facility Term Loan.\nOn December 4, 2019, the Company closed a senior note offering, consisting of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Operating Partnership's 2029 Senior Notes.\nOn December 20, 2019, the $400.0 million 2021 Senior Notes were redeemed, and the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon was repaid.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Operating Partnership had $2.85 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding. The indenture governing the Senior Notes requires that the Company be in compliance with certain key financial covenants, including maintaining the following:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Bond Key Covenants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Required\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limitation on incurrence of total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 65%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limitation on incurrence of secured debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2264 40%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt service coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 1.5x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance of total unencumbered assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u2265 150%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company believes that it was in compliance with these financial covenants based on the covenant limits and calculations in place at that time.\nConvertible Debt\nSummary and Obligations\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased $80.7 million of the 2020 Convertible Notes and paid accrued and unpaid interest thereon. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $321.8 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes outstanding. The OP has issued corresponding identical convertible notes to the General Partner. There were no changes to the terms of the 2020 Convertible Notes during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the Company believes that it was in compliance with the financial covenants pursuant to the indenture governing the 2020 Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2019.\nMortgage Notes Payable\nSummary and Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had non-recourse mortgage indebtedness of $1.5 billion, which was collateralized by 355 properties, reflecting a decrease from December 31, 2018 of $388.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to prepayments of mortgage notes payable. Our mortgage indebtedness bore interest at the weighted-average rate of 5.05% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 2.8 years. We may in the future incur additional mortgage debt on the properties we currently own or use long-term non-recourse financing to acquire additional properties.\nThe payment terms of our loan obligations vary. In general, only interest amounts are payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity. Some of our loan agreements require that we comply with specific reporting and financial covenants mainly related to debt coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios. Each loan that has these requirements has specific ratio thresholds that must be met.\nRestrictions on Loan Covenants\nOur mortgage loan obligations generally restrict corporate guarantees and require the maintenance of financial covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios), as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth. The mortgage loan agreements contain no dividend restrictions except in the event of default or when a distribution would drive liquidity below the applicable thresholds. The Company believes that it was in compliance with the financial covenants under the mortgage loan agreements and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends as of December 31, 2019.\nDerivative Activity\nAs discussed in Note 6 - Debt and Note 7 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate $900.0 million notional amount, effective on February 6, 2019 and maturing on January 31, 2023, to hedge interest rate volatility. Due to an improvement in the Company's credit rating during the fourth quarter of 2019, the interest rate spread on the $900.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan was reduced by 25 bps to LIBOR + 1.10%, and beginning on November 1, 2019, the swap agreements effectively fixed the Credit Facility Term Loan interest rate at 3.59%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company also entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $400.0 million, which were designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows associated with the anticipated issuance of long-term debt. The Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of 120 months (excluding forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments), with anticipated issuance of 10-year public debt.\nDividends\nOn November 5, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1375 per share of Common Stock (equaling an annualized dividend of $0.55 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2019 to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2019, which was paid on January 15, 2020. An equivalent distribution by the Operating Partnership is applicable per OP Unit.\nOur Series F Preferred Stock, as discussed in Note 12 - Equity to our consolidated financial statements, will pay cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 6.70% per annum on their liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (equivalent to $1.675 per share on an annual basis).\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - mortgage notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,529,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>588,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - mortgage notes (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,050,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>900,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - Credit Facility (1) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - corporate bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,850,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - corporate bonds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>796,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>219,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - convertible debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - convertible debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and ground lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commitments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,228,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>780,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,197,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,449,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,800,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Interest payments due in future periods on the $164.4 million of variable rate debt were calculated using a forward LIBOR curve.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019, we had $900.0 million of variable rate debt on the Credit Facility Term Loan effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements.

The increase was primarily due to a $524.5 million increase in litigation and non-routine costs, net, including litigation settlements, paid during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $462.1 million to $613.2 million from $151.1 million during the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily related to an increase in cash proceeds from dispositions of real estate and joint ventures of $565.2 million and a decrease in investments in real estate assets of $106.0 million, offset by a decrease in net proceeds from disposition of discontinued operations of $122.9 million, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of CMBS and mortgage notes receivables of $37.1 million and an increase in payments for capital expenditures and leasing costs and real estate developments of $34.6 million.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities of $525.4 million decreased $130.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 from $655.4 million during the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily related to $1.0 billion of proceeds received from the issuance of Common Stock in 2019, offset by the redemption of $300.1 million of Series F Preferred Stock in 2019, an increase in payments on mortgage notes payable and other debt, including debt extinguishment costs of $236.2 million, and a decrease of $170.0 million in net proceeds related to the credit facilities, corporate bonds and convertible notes. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, $192.0 million of payments were made related to the surrender of Limited Partner OP Units, with no comparable activity during the same period in 2018.\nPlease refer to the discussion in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed February 21, 2019, for the cash flow analysis for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nElection as a REIT\nThe General Partner elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. As a REIT, except as discussed below, the General Partner generally is not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its stockholders so long as it distributes at least 90% of its annual taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains). REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if the General Partner maintains its qualification for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, federal income taxes on certain income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. We believe we are organized and operating in such a manner as to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Operating Partnership is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, each partner in the Operating Partnership is required to take into account its allocable share of the Operating Partnership's income, gains, losses, deductions and credits for each taxable year. However, the Operating Partnership may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property. Under the LPA, the Operating Partnership is required to conduct business in such a manner as to permit the General Partner at all times to qualify as a REIT.\nAs discussed in Note 14 -Discontinued Operations, on February 1, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its investment management segment, Cole Capital. The Company conducted substantially all of the Cole Capital business activities through a TRS. A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to corporate federal, state and local income taxes, as applicable. The Company's use of a TRS enables it to engage in certain business activities while complying with the REIT qualification requirements and to retain any income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement to distribute those earnings. The Company conducts all of its business in the United States and Puerto Rico and, as a result, it files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, Puerto Rico, and various state and local jurisdictions. Certain of the Company's inter-company transactions that have been eliminated in consolidation for financial accounting purposes are also subject to taxation.\nInflation\nWe may be adversely impacted by inflation on any leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. However, net leases that require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.\nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nThrough the closing of the Cole Capital sale, we were contractually responsible for managing the Cole REITs' affairs on a day-to-day basis. For further explanation of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees see Note 15 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements in this report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.", "summary": "The report is a Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for VEREIT, a real estate operating company. It includes an overview of the company's real estate portfolio, critical accounting policies, recent activities, operating and financial metrics, and details about the company's financial performance in 2019. This includes discussions on rental revenue, operating expenses, interest expense, and gains or losses on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d Certain risks may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this report entitled Risk Factors\u201d.\nOverview\nVEREIT is a full-service real estate operating company which owns and manages one of the largest portfolios of single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S. The Company has 3,858 retail, restaurant, office and industrial operating properties with an aggregate 89.5 million rentable square feet, of which 99.1% was leased as of December 31, 2019, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 8.3 years.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different assumptions or estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn connection with prior mergers, we recorded goodwill as a result of the merger consideration exceeding the net assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. As part of the annual qualitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of each year, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying value including, but not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 Macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets. \n \u2022 Industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for an entity's products or services, or a regulatory or political development. \n \u2022 Cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows. \n \u2022 Overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods. \n \u2022 Other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; contemplation of bankruptcy; or litigation. \n \u2022 Events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. \n \u2022 Sustained decrease in share price (both in absolute terms and relative to peers). \nWe performed the annual qualitative assessment for goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2019. As a result of the qualitative analysis, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is greater than the carrying value. As such, no further testing was performed.\nReal Estate Investment Impairment\nWe invest in real estate assets and subsequently monitor those investments quarterly for impairment, including the review of real estate properties subject to direct financing leases. Additionally, we record depreciation and amortization related to our investments. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to real estate investments include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets affect the amount of depreciation and amortization recognized on our investments. \n \u2022 The review of impairment indicators and subsequent determination of the undiscounted future cash flows could require us to reduce the value of assets and recognize an impairment loss. \n \u2022 The fair value of held for sale assets is estimated by management. This estimated value could result in a reduction of the carrying value of the asset. \n \u2022 The evaluation of real estate assets for potential impairment requires our management to exercise significant judgment and make certain key assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties in making these estimates such as market conditions and performance and sustainability of our tenants. \n \u2022 Changes related to management's intent to sell or lease the real estate assets used to develop the forecasted cash flows may have a material impact on our financial results.  Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets\nIn connection with our acquisition of properties, we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective estimated fair values. Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets consist of above- and below- market lease values and the value of in-place leases. Our purchase price allocations are developed utilizing third-party appraisal reports, industry standards and management experience. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to purchase price allocations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The value allocated to land as opposed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements affects the amount of depreciation expense we record. If more value is attributed to land, depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. \n \u2022 Intangible lease assets and liabilities can be significantly affected by estimates, including market rent, lease term including renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates, carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease-up period, and current market conditions and costs, including tenant improvement allowances and rent concessions. \n \u2022 We determine whether any financing assumed is above- or below- market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar investment properties.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Highlights and Key Performance Indicators\n2019 Activity\nOperations\n \u2022 Acquired controlling financial interests in 66 commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of $403.6 million, which includes $2.3 million of external acquisition-related expenses that were capitalized. \n \u2022 Disposed of 201 properties, including the sale of six consolidated properties to the Industrial Partnership and one property sold through a foreclosure, for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.2 billion, of which the Company's share was $1.1 billion, resulting in proceeds of $1.1 billion after closing costs.

Subsequent to January 1, 2018, the Company acquired 118 occupied properties for an aggregate purchase price of $904.3 million and disposed of 351 consolidated properties for an aggregate sales price of $1.6 billion.\nOperating Expenses\nThe table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain operating expense information and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nAcquisition-Related Expenses\nAcquisition-related expenses consist of allocated internal salaries related to time spent on acquiring commercial properties and costs associated with unconsummated deals.\nLitigation and non-routine costs, net\nLitigation and non-routine costs, net increased $524.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $587.0 million increase in litigation settlement costs to $820.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $233.2 million during the same period 2018, which related to litigation filed as a result of the findings of the Audit Committee Investigation.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a gain related to one deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction with the lender of a mortgage loan, which was secured by one property.\nOther Income, Net\nThe decrease in other income, net of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to a $5.1 million gain in 2018 from measuring the Company's investments in Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc. ( CCIT II\u201d), Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. ( CCIT III\u201d) and Cole Credit Property Trust V, Inc. ( CCPT V\u201d) at fair value after the investments were no longer accounted for using the equity method and a $4.8 million payment received in 2018 related to a fully reserved loan receivable recorded in other income, offset by $4.2 million of payments received in 2019 related to the Company's bankruptcy claims related to two prior tenants and a $2.2 million loss in 2018 related to the sale of six commercial mortgage-backed securities.\nEquity in Income and Gain on Disposition of Unconsolidated Entities\nThe increase in equity in income and gain on disposition of unconsolidated entities of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to the Company's investment in the Industrial Partnership.\nGain on Disposition of Real Estate and Real Estate Assets Held for Sale, Net\nThe increase in gain on disposition of real estate and real estate assets held for sale, net of $198.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

As such, no further testing was performed.\nReal Estate Investment Impairment\nWe invest in real estate assets and subsequently monitor those investments quarterly for impairment, including the review of real estate properties subject to direct financing leases. Additionally, we record depreciation and amortization related to our investments. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to real estate investments include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets affect the amount of depreciation and amortization recognized on our investments. \n \u2022 The review of impairment indicators and subsequent determination of the undiscounted future cash flows could require us to reduce the value of assets and recognize an impairment loss. \n \u2022 The fair value of held for sale assets is estimated by management. This estimated value could result in a reduction of the carrying value of the asset. \n \u2022 The evaluation of real estate assets for potential impairment requires our management to exercise significant judgment and make certain key assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties in making these estimates such as market conditions and performance and sustainability of our tenants. \n \u2022 Changes related to management's intent to sell or lease the real estate assets used to develop the forecasted cash flows may have a material impact on our financial results.  Allocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets\nIn connection with our acquisition of properties, we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective estimated fair values. Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets consist of above- and below- market lease values and the value of in-place leases. Our purchase price allocations are developed utilizing third-party appraisal reports, industry standards and management experience. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to purchase price allocations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 The value allocated to land as opposed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements affects the amount of depreciation expense we record. If more value is attributed to land, depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. \n \u2022 Intangible lease assets and liabilities can be significantly affected by estimates, including market rent, lease term including renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates, carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease-up period, and current market conditions and costs, including tenant improvement allowances and rent concessions. \n \u2022 We determine whether any financing assumed is above- or below- market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar investment properties.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Highlights and Key Performance Indicators\n2019 Activity\nOperations\n \u2022 Acquired controlling financial interests in 66 commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of $403.6 million, which includes $2.3 million of external acquisition-related expenses that were capitalized. \n \u2022 Disposed of 201 properties, including the sale of six consolidated properties to the Industrial Partnership and one property sold through a foreclosure, for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.2 billion, of which the Company's share was $1.1 billion, resulting in proceeds of $1.1 billion after closing costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a gain related to one deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction with the lender of a mortgage loan, which was secured by one property.\nOther Income, Net\nThe decrease in other income, net of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to a $5.1 million gain in 2018 from measuring the Company's investments in Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc.
