Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nThe following MD&A is intended to help you understand the business operations and financial condition of the Company. This MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n\u2022Executive Overview\n\u2022Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities\n\u2022Market Overview\n\u2022Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\u2022Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nVeoneer is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices in Stockholm, Sweden. The Company functions as a holding corporation and owns two principal operating subsidiaries, Veoneer AB and Veoneer US, Inc. On June 29, 2018, the Spin-Off of Veoneer from Autoliv, Inc. (\"Autoliv\") was completed through the distribution by Autoliv of all the outstanding shares of common stock of Veoneer to Autoliv's stockholders as of the close of business on June 12, 2018, the common stock record date for the distribution, in a tax-free, pro rata distribution (the \"Spin-Off\"). On July 2, 2018, the shares of Veoneer common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VNE\u201d and the Veoneer Swedish Depository Receipts representing shares of Veoneer common stock commenced trading on Nasdaq Stockholm under the symbol VNE SDB.\u201d\nVeoneer is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture, and sale of automotive safety electronics with a focus on innovation, quality and manufacturing excellence. Prior to the Spin-Off, Veoneer operated for almost four years as an operating segment within Autoliv. Veoneer's safety systems are designed to make driving safer and easier, more comfortable and convenient for the end consumer and to intervene before a potential collision. Veoneer endeavors to prevent vehicle accidents or reduce the severity of impact in the event a crash is unavoidable. Through our customer focus, being an expert partner with our customers, we intend to develop human centric systems that benefit automotive light vehicle occupants.\nVeoneer's current product offering includes automotive radars, mono-and stereo-vision cameras, night driving assist (thermal sensing) systems, Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) electronic control units, passive safety electronics (airbag control units, crash sensors and seat belt pre-tensioner electronic controllers), brake control systems, brake control electronic controllers, and a complete ADAS software offering including perception and driving policy (ArriverTM) towards highly automated driving (HAD) and eventually autonomous driving (AD). In addition, we offer driver monitoring systems, LiDAR sensors, RoadScape positioning systems and other technologies critical for ADAS, HAD and AD solutions by leveraging our partnership network and internally developed intellectual property.\nExecutive Overview\nThe fourth quarter saw an unfortunate resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to put the health and safety of our people first, reinforcing our measures that were first put in place in the beginning of the pandemic, and we believe that the global efforts and vaccinations that have now started will allow the situation to gradually improve throughout 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020 Veoneer saw organic growth for the first time, a pivotal moment for the Company. The strong growth was driven by new launches and a stronger development of the light vehicle production than anticipated in the beginning of the quarter. We further continued our strong focus on efficiencies and financial management, which allowed us to finish the year in a stronger cash position than anticipated. Despite some initial additional launch related costs, our ability to deliver new products and technologies to recently launched vehicle platforms in the current uncertain environment was an outstanding achievement.\nDuring 2020, we experienced dramatic declines in the vehicle production during the first half, and an unprecedented rebound in the second half. This global development, which was witnessed across multiple industries, has created serious challenges for supply of electronic components. Relatively speaking, we believe we have managed this situation well, but we do expect the tightness in supply to affect the global light vehicle production during the first half of 2021. Currently, the effects are difficult to quantify, and we monitor and manage this situation daily.\nDuring the fourth quarter we negotiated, and in January 2021 finalized an agreement with Qualcomm to build a world leading solution in ADAS and AD, which we anticipate will be ready for commercial launches in 2024. To build this business we have created Arriver\u2122, our new software unit and brand which will be fully focused on further developing perception, fusion and drive policy software for the next generation cars. It builds on more than a decade of experience in Active Safety development and for drive policy software on previous cooperation with Volvo Cars (VCC) in the Zenuity joint venture. It will deliver an open, scalable and flexible architecture solution running on Qualcomm's next generation Snapdragon Ride\u2122 System on a Chip (SoC) platform. Our joint expectation is to create a leading ADAS and AD solution, which over time, will form the core of one of the leading ecosystems for automation in our industry. With Qualcomm having the lead go-to-market responsibility, we are already receiving very positive feedback from initial presentations to vehicle OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers.\nThe trend of a changing automotive industry is stronger than ever. Veoneer is right in the middle of this development and we have recently taken critical steps to position our company for the future. We have divested our brake control business, dissolved our joint venture with VCC, and now created Arriver\u2122. We are also revisiting our Lidar strategy as we see rapid changes in the core technology development. For example, on January 25, 2021 Veoneer received a cancellation notice from an autonomous vehicle customer due to a change in their core Lidar technology. We are evaluating several new opportunities for Veoneer as a lidar system integrator and industrialization partner for new lidar startups.\nWith health and safety as our first priority, our focus remains to be on flawless daily execution, winning new profitable business and building a world leading technology portfolio.\n2021 Outlook and Mid-Term Targets Update\nThe macro-economic environment remains very uncertain, mainly due to the global supply chain challenges created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These global supply chain shortages have led multiple OEM customers to reduce their production schedules on short notice, which in turn makes the global LVP very difficult to forecast. Due to this fluid situation, we believe the latest IHS Markit production forecast may be optimistic for the first quarter of 2021. Our indication for the first quarter of 2021 is that our organic sales (non-U.S. GAAP measure) are expected to out-perform the global LVP as compared to the same quarter in 2020 and sequentially from the fourth quarter in 2020 also out-perform the global LVP.\nFor the full year 2021, we expect our organic sales growth (non-U.S. GAAP measure) to exceed 25% and a currency translation, net increase of 5%, both as compared to 2020. Also for full year 2021, we estimate Active Safety organic sales growth to be approximately 45%. We anticipate positive leverage on this organic sales growth during 2021 to improve our gross margin, however, this leverage improvement is expected to be more weighted toward the second half of 2021.\nThe current RD&E, net run rate, after the completion of various MAI program initiatives, is now expected to be in the range of $110 to $120 million per quarter as we head into 2021, while capital expenditures and depreciation are expected to be approximately $100 million and $115 million, respectively, for the full year 2021. As a result of these underlying assumptions, we expect our operating loss for the full year 2021 to improve as compared to 2020, and we expect our cash balance to be more than $400 million at 2021 year-end. We also expect our operating loss and cash flow performance to improve sequentially during 2021. Veoneer expects its order intake in terms of annual average sales and lifetime sales to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nLooking beyond 2021 to our mid-term targets, we expect Veoneer's strong organic sales to continue and now expect net sales to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2023, based on our strong order intake over the last several years and order book of approximately $14 billion. The Company expects to arrive to a sustainable operating profit and positive free cash flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure) during 2023.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Commentary\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause significant uncertainty in the global economy. This includes the automotive industry and the global LVP for 2021 and the upcoming years ahead, which are dependent on underlying consumer demand.\nAs our OEM customers recovered to more normal volumes, or higher than normal volumes in certain countries, we have returned to higher production levels as well. The health and safety of our associates continues to be our first priority, and we are taking the necessary actions to protect our associates, safeguard our operations and meet our customers' needs while managing through these unprecedented circumstances.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our customers in Europe and North America generally stabilized their production, after most factories had been idled, or running on very reduced schedules, during the latter part of the first quarter and the early part of the second quarter. However, during the fourth quarter, we experienced an even stronger increase in production ramp-ups by our customers in China, while the production in other Asian vehicle producing countries has stabilized from the initial recovery during the second quarter of 2020. The strong customer call-offs in China have continued into the first quarter of 2021 and continue to create challenges in the supply chain for certain key components in our restraint control business.\nWe believe our latest planning assumptions, primarily based on our customer call-offs and forecasts, reflect a lower global LVP for Q1'21 due to the fact that we foresee more customer production interruptions, due to global supply base constraints, than reflected in the latest IHS Markit projections as of January 18, 2021. The latest IHS Markit forecast indicates a YoY LVP increase of approximately 14% for Q1'21 and a 13% sequential decline from Q4'20. We continue to monitor the global supply base very closely as well as the overall COVID-19 pandemic situation for potential impacts to our business.\nFor 2020 and the upcoming years, the most important driver for Veoneer's business is new customer and technology launches, which should drive significant out-performance as compared to the global LVP.\nAs noted in our 2020 results, in response to the pandemic, the Company continues to extend its MAIs to further mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its cash flow and operating results. The actions taken by the Company to mitigate the impact, including reducing its annual RD&E, net by more than $100 million and other expenses while reducing the Company's operating loss and conserving cash in 2020, resulted in a cash balance of $758 million for the year-ending 2020.\nTrends, Uncertainties and Opportunities\nTrend toward Collaborative Driving\nThe market around us continues to change rapidly, shifting towards a more autotech environment from the traditional automotive industry. The industry developments during the last two years have further strengthened the trend toward advanced driver support - Collaborative Driving - and away from fully autonomous cars for the consumer based vehicle mass market.\nNew technologies, creating new levels of interaction and driver support are once again revolutionizing the driving experience; however we believe the driver will remain actively involved for many years to come. While the industry refers to Level 2+\u201d or even \"Level 2++\" Veoneer calls this Collaborative Driving, and includes any Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) level of automation. At the same time there is a growing realization that the introduction of truly self-driving cars will likely take longer and be more expensive than previously anticipated. This fundamental insight opens up new opportunities for companies, including Veoneer, but it also requires adjusting resource priorities. As such, we believe that the market will stay mainly focused on Level 1-Level 2+ automated driving solutions for the next decade however, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our industry during the first half of 2020, and any potential future impact of the pandemic on economic conditions could affect the evolution of ADAS, Collaborative Driving and AD for consumer purchased light vehicles.\nGlobal Regulatory and Test Rating Developments\nEurope continues to take a proactive role in promoting or requiring Active Safety technologies. The European New Car Assessment Program ( NCAP\u201d) continuously updates its test rating program to include more active safety technologies to help the European Union reach its target of cutting road fatalities by 50% by 2030, as compared to 2020.\nOne June 26, 2020, the UNECE's World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, announced the first binding international regulation on level 3\u201d vehicle automation. The new regulation marks an important step towards the wider deployment of automated vehicles to help realize a vision of safer, more sustainable mobility for all. Starting in January 2021 the regulation provides guidelines on the Automated Lane Keep System (\"ALKS\") feature, requires driver availability recognition systems, and a \"black box\" data storage system for AD. It also outlines requirements for emergency and minimal risk maneuvers and driver transition demand as well as cyber-security and software update protocols.\nIn May 2020 Euro NCAP announced that it was postponing the roll-out of upcoming road map updates by one year (from 2022 to 2023 and from 2024 to 2025). This should help our industry to overcome the situation with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it should not change the overall trend towards introduction of new roadmap requirements, which are just delayed by one year. We anticipate strong global sensor adoption rate increases (forward, side and rear) due to the European NCAP's push for crash avoidance, increased adoption rates due to growing demand around ADAS software features, volume growth due to redundant sensing concepts needed for higher levels of autonomy, potential opportunities in\nrelation to compliance with cyber-security and software updates and step-by-step increased demand for connectivity components as a result.\nOn May 17, 2018, the European Commission proposed a new mandate, as part of the European General Safety Regulation (\"GSR\") road-map through 2028, to make certain Active Safety features compulsory in light vehicles by 2022. During March of 2019 the EU mandate was adopted as initially proposed by the European Commission. We believe that adoption of the mandate will significantly expand demand for our Active Safety products. Indeed, with respect to sensors and ADAS software features, our order intake since the adoption of the mandate seems to reflect the anticipated increase in demand. However, during 2019 we saw some OEMs delays in the sourcing of these technologies as customers reconsidered how they want to architect and design, in a scalable way to include these new standard technologies. In addition, we believe that the mandate and the European GSR generally will influence other market regulators as they evaluate their respective vehicle test rating programs and safety legislation.\nIn China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Key Working Points of Intelligent Connected Vehicle Standardization for 2018 to promote and facilitate the development of the intelligent connected vehicles industry, and advance the development of fundamental standards and those that are in urgent demand. The guideline has pointed out that more than 30 key standards will be defined by 2020 to fund the systems for ADAS and low-level autonomous driving, and a system of over 100 standards will be set up by 2025 for higher level autonomous driving.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, the Chinese government commenced testing of new vehicles according to the new China New Car Assessment Program where active safety features like Autonomous Emergency Braking (\"AEB\") are required to achieve the maximum safety rating.\nThe Chinese Government is also aiming for half of the vehicles sold by 2025 to be equipped with partial self-driving technology according to their updated Made in China 2025\u201d program announced in November 2020. Furthermore the goal is to have Level 2\u201d and Level 3\u201d semi-autonomous driving technology installed in 70% of the cars by 2030.\nOn October 4, 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DoT\") issued new voluntary guidelines on automated driving systems (\"ADS\") under its Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0\u201d initiative, building on its Vision for Safety 2.0\u201d from September 2017, which prioritized aligning federal guidance around twelve safety design elements of interest to the auto industry. This initiative should have a positive impact on the adoption of ADAS and HAD on the road towards Autonomous Vehicles (\"AV\").\nOn April 2, 2020 the DoT closed the comment period for the Automated Vehicles 4.0\u201d which seeks to ensure a consistent U.S. Government approach to AV technologies, and to detail the authorities, research, and investments being made across the United States so that the United States can continue to lead AV technology research, development, and integration.\nIn 2018 the UN Economic Commission for Europe created a new Working Party to deal with regulations for Automated/Autonomous and Connected Vehicles. In addition to the EU and Japan, which have both started to work closely together to develop ADAS regulations, in the last three years, the U.S. and China becoming more active in several working groups towards harmonization of future regulations for ADAS and AV. This would create a common umbrella for countries which follow type-approval rules (EU, Japan, Australia) and countries which are outside of type-approval system, e.g., under self-certification regimes (U.S., Korea) or specific national rules (China).\nKey upcoming regulations are (i) safety critical ADAS-features (e.g. AEB); (ii) Highway AV-features (Physical and Virtual Tests + Real World Test Drive + Audit); (iii) Cyber-security and Software updates; and in subsequent-step for (iv) Connected Vehicles. On one hand, the agreement on minimal common base requirements for the industry will take a longer time and therefore may postpone introduction of regulations. On the other hand, the harmonization with base requirements would help the industry while a more active position from China may help to pull forward some safety critical ADAS technologies which are not yet considered as relevant for regulation in EU and Japan (e.g. Blind Spot or Night).\nMarket Overview\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Millions (except where specified)\nIHS Markit as of January 18, 2021\n</td> <td>Light Vehicle Production by Region - 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>China </td> <td> </td> <td>Japan </td> <td> </td> <td>Rest of Asia </td> <td> </td> <td>Americas </td> <td> </td> <td>Europe </td> <td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year 2020 </td> <td>22.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>71.6 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change vs. 2019 </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(23) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the full year of 2020, the global light vehicle production (according to IHS Markit) declined by approximately 17% as compared to 2019. The main driver of this sharp decline was primarily due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative pandemic effects mostly impacted North America and Europe from mid-March through May and Asia from February through mid-April. As a result all major vehicle producing countries or regions decline in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nThis decline is approximately 16 percentage points lower than expected at the beginning of 2020, and is the largest single year decline since the financial crisis in 2009. Within the Americas North America declined 21%, while within Rest of Asia South Korea declined 10%, and lastly within Europe, Western Europe declined 25% while Eastern Europe declined 16%.\nThis is the third consecutive annual decline in light vehicle production from 2017 when a record 92 million vehicles were produced. The most recent IHS Markit 2021 outlook is for global light vehicle production to rebound and increase approximately 13% from 2020 levels to 82 million vehicles in 2021. North America, Western Europe and China are expected to be the largest contributors to the increase in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-U.S. GAAP financial measures are reconciled throughout this report.\nIn this report we refer to organic sales or changes in organic sales growth, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that we, investors and analysts use to analyze the Company's sales trends and performance. We believe that this measure assists investors and management in analyzing trends in the Company's business because the Company generates approximately 66% of its sales in currencies other than in U.S. dollars (its reporting currency) and currency rates have been and can be rather volatile. The Company has historically made several acquisitions and divestitures, although none that impacted the reporting periods in question. Organic sales and organic sales growth represent the increase or decrease in the overall U.S. dollar net sales on a comparable basis, allowing separate discussions of the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and exchange rates on the Company's performance. The tables in this report present the reconciliation of changes in the total U.S. GAAP net sales to changes in organic sales growth.\nThe Company uses in this report EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which represents the Company's net income excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and including loss from equity method investment. The tables below provide reconciliations of net income (loss) to EBITDA.\nThe Company uses in this report net working capital, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which is defined as current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) minus current liabilities excluding short-term debt and net assets and liabilities held for sale. The Company also uses in this report cash flow before financing activities, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net cash used in operating activities plus net cash used in investing activities. The Company also uses in this report free cash flow a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Management uses these measures to improve its ability to assess operating performance at a point in time as well as the trends over time. The tables set forth in Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non U.S. GAAP\u201d below provide a reconciliation of current assets and liabilities to net working capital, cash flow before financing activities and free cash flow.\nInvestors should not consider these non-U.S. GAAP measures as substitutes, but rather as additions, to financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures, as defined, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nForward-looking non-U.S. GAAP financial measures used in this report are provided on a non-U.S. GAAP basis. Veoneer has not provided a U.S. GAAP reconciliation of these measures because items that impact these measures, such as foreign currency exchange rates and future investing activities, cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts and Veoneer is unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2020 compared to 2019\nThe following tables show Veoneer's performance by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 along with components of change compared to the prior year. As a result of the completion of its strategic initiatives during 2020, starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 Veoneer is organized into one product area Safety Electronics, which includes Restraint Control Systems and Active Safety. Although the Company continues to sell legacy Brakes Systems to Honda as well as component Brake ECUs to ZF this is not a separate segment as it is immaterial to Veoneer's overall business\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electronics Segment </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>Components of Change vs. Prior Year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions, (except where specified) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. GAAP Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Currency </td> <td> </td> <td>Organic1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Chg. $ </td> <td> </td> <td>Chg. % </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(227) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(240) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Loss / Margin </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(268) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(324) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA1 / %\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(167) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(242) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Associates </td> <td>7,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Non-U.S. GAAP measure reconciliation for Organic Sales and EBITDA\nNet Sales - Net sales for the Electronics segment decreased by $227 million to $1,303 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. This sales decline was mainly due to the organic sales1 decline in Active Safety and Restraint Control Systems of $155 million and $94 million, respectively, along with the currency translation effects of $13 million.\nOperating Loss - Operating loss for the Electronics segment of $268 million for the year ended December 31 2020 decreased by $56 million as compared to 2019. This improvement was primarily due to the higher than normal engineering reimbursements, lower RD&E gross, including the costs related to the Zenuity software team, which was previously reported in the equity method loss, and strategic initiative recoveries. All of these helped to mitigate the negative LVP impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, and volume and product mix effects causing the lower organic sales for the segment.\nEBITDA1 - EBITDA loss for Electronics segment decreased by $75 million to negative $167 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. This change is mainly due to the decrease in operating loss for the segment while depreciation and amortization increased by $19 million mainly due to previous investments for growth.\nAssociates - Associates, net in the Electronics segment decreased by 4 net to 7,380 as compared to full year 2019. Overall reductions were mostly offset by the additional Zenuity software associates of approximately 225.\nDeliveries - Deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2020 Restraint Controls Systems and Active Safety were 13 and 7.2 million units, respectively.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brake Systems Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>Components of Change vs. Prior Year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions,\n(except where specified) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. GAAP Reported </td> <td>Currency </td> <td> </td> <td>Divestiture </td> <td> </td> <td>Organic1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td>Chg. $ </td> <td> </td> <td>Chg.% </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(319) </td> <td> </td> <td>(86) </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(292) </td> <td> </td> <td>(78) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> <td>(53) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Loss / Margin </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> <td>(70.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td>-64 </td> <td>(17.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment EBITDA1 / Margin\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> <td>(66.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td>-32 </td> <td>(8.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Associates </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,447 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,447) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Non-U.S. GAAP measure reconciliation for Organic Sales and EBITDA\nNet Sales - Net sales for the Brake Systems segment decreased by $319 million to $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019.

Organic sales1 declined by 16% as compared to the 17% decline in global LVP for the same period. The net currency translation effect was 1% while the remainder of the sales decline was due to the Brake Systems divestitures impact of 15%.\nDuring the full year of 2020, excluding Brake Systems and Other, organic sales declined in North America by 26%, Europe by 13% and Asia by 8%, primarily due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain customer launch delays. These negative effects mostly impacted North America and Europe from mid-March through May and Asia from February through mid-April.\nRestraint Control Systems - Net sales for the full year of 2020 decreased by 19% to $670 million as compared to 2019. The organic sales decline was due to lower volumes in North America, China and South Korea, where we have a temporary phase-out of our products on certain vehicle models, and lower underlying LVP.\nActive Safety - Net sales for the full year of 2020 decreased by 12% to $624 million as compared to 2019. This decline was driven by net currency translation effects of 1% while organic sales declined by 13%. The fourth quarter in 2020 was the inflection point for a return to organic sales growth in the Active Safety product area.\nStrong demand for mono, stereo and night vision (thermal sensing) systems and ADAS ECUs on several models drove an increase in organic sales. This growth was more than offset by the negative product mix impact from 24GHz to 77GHz radar technology and the phase-out of mono vision cameras on certain BMW models.\nBrake Systems and Other - Net sales for the full year of 2020 decreased by $293 million to $79 million as compared to 2019. The impact of the Brake Systems divestitures was 78% or $292 million. Approximately $45 million of the Brake Systems sales are related to the Honda legacy business and Other sales of $9 million are Brake ECUs.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Participating share awards with right to receive dividend equivalents are (under the two class method) excluded from EPS calculation.\nGross Profit - Gross profit of $182 million for the full year of 2020 was $129 million lower as compared to 2019. The main contributors were the global LVP decline and volume and product mix effects which caused the lower organic sales. The Brake Systems divestitures impact was $(43) million and the net currency effects were $3 million.\nOperating Loss - Operating loss of $367 million for the full year of 2020 decreased by $93 million as compared to 2019 despite the sales drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Brake Systems divestitures impact was $32 million while the net currency effects were $(4) million.\nRD&E, net of $407 million for the full year 2020 improved by $155 million as compared to 2019, due to $60 million of higher than normal engineering reimbursements and lower gross costs. The Brake Systems divestitures benefit was $48 million while additional Zenuity associates partially offset these benefits by $21 million.\nSG&A expense of $165 million for the full year 2020 improved $24 million as compared to 2019, due to lower consultancy, IT and associate related costs. The Brake Systems divestitures benefit was $17 million.\nOther income and amortization of intangibles combined improved $43 million for the full year 2020 as compared to 2019 mainly due to lower amortization of intangibles, also including $13 million related to the VNBS-Asia divestiture, a $20 million recovery from NK and a $10 million recovery related to an IP license sold to VCC.\nNet Loss - Net loss of $544 million for the full year 2020 increased by $22 million as compared to 2019. The $(91) million net effect of the divestiture gain on VNBS-Asia and impairments of VBS-US and the Zenuity JV split were more than offset by the combined operating loss and equity method investment improvement of $124 million.\nInterest, net for the full year 2020 was $(19) million as compared to 2019, due to higher interest expense related to the convertible debt of $7 million and lower cash level yielding lower interest income. Other non-operating items, net increased $5 million due to currency losses.\nIncome tax expense of $32 million for the full year 2020 was $31 million higher as compared to 2019. This change is mainly due to $23 million of tax expense on the VNBS-Asia divestiture and the $10 million benefit on the convertible debt in 2019.\nNon-controlling interest for the full year 2020 was $23 million lower as compared to 2019 due to the Brake Systems divestiture during Q1'20.\nLoss per Share - Loss per share of $4.89 for the full year 2020 improved by $0.03 as compared to 2019. The lower operating loss and equity method investments combined of $1.11 per share was partially offset by the combined effects of non-cash items from the VNBS-Asia divestiture gain, VBS-US impairment and Zenuity impairment of $(0.82) per share. The share count increase in 2019 reduced the loss for full year 2020 by $0.54 per share.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2019 compared to 2018\nVeoneer's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 along with components of change compared to the prior year that have been omitted under this item can be found in Part II, Item 7.

working capital requirements and capital expenditures and investments for growth in RD&E.\nIn early 2019, as a result of multiple factors, including general market conditions, numerous customer change requests, and challenges involved in developing new technologies for various customer programs, Veoneer launched a broad initiative, as part of its Market Adjustment Initiatives Program, to have its customers contribute more to the cost of developing these programs. The Company began to approach customers to negotiate or renegotiate new or existing agreements to provide for more cost sharing. The Company received total net cash reimbursement from customers in 2020 of $88 million for past completed engineering services and $30 million in 2019 as a reduction of research, development and engineering.\nAs of February 3, 2020, Veoneer received approximately $176 million cash from the sale of VNBS Asia operations.\nOn May 28, 2019, the Company issued, in a registered public offering in the U.S., Convertible Senior Notes (the \"Notes\") with an aggregate principal amount of $207 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2019. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2024, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to June 1, 2022.\nIn addition, the Company has other obligations such as short and long-term borrowings related to operations, inventory, services, tooling and property, plant and equipment purchased in the ordinary course of business.\nOn June 30, 2017, Veoneer committed to make a $15 million investment in Autotech Fund I, L.P. pursuant to a limited partnership agreement, and as a limited partner, will periodically make capital contributions toward this total commitment amount. As of December 31, 2020, Veoneer contributed a total of approximately $12 million to the fund. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has received approximately $3 million of distributions from the fund. The initial term of the fund is set to expire on December 31, 2025. This fund focuses broadly on the automotive industry and complements the Company's innovation strategy, particularly in the areas of Active Safety and ADAS. Under the limited partnership agreement, the general partner has the sole and exclusive right to manage, control and conduct the affairs of the fund.\nCash Flow\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected cash flow items </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net working capital1\n</td> <td>(97) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>(192) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(325) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td>(91) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(213) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity method investments </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by investing activities </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(265) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow before Financing Activities1\n</td> <td>(107) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(590) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>636 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Non-U.S. GAAP measure see reconciliation for Net Working Capital\nNet Working Capital1 - Net working capital of $(97) million decreased by $100 million during the full year of 2020 primarily due to a reduction in inventories, net and increases in accounts payable and accruals.\nNet cash used in operating activities - Net cash used in operating activities of $192 million for the full year of 2020 improved $133 million as compared to 2019 due to the strong working capital performance and lower net loss when considering the non-cash loss on divestitures.\nCapital Expenditures - Capital expenditures of $91 million, or 7% of sales, for the full year of 2020 decreased by $122 million as compared to 2019 mainly due to lower investments in the Brake Systems segment, facility expansions and engineering related IT.\nNet cash provided by investing activities - Net cash provided by investing activities of $85 million during the full year of 2020 increased by $350 million as compared to 2019 due to lower capital expenditures and proceeds from divestitures.\nCash flow before financing activities1 - The cash flow before financing activities of $(107) million for the full year of 2020 improved $483 million as compared to 2019 due to the improved operating cash flow performance, lower capital expenditures and divestiture proceeds.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Associates </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Associates </td> <td> </td> <td>7,543 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,874 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Whereof: </td> <td> </td> <td>Direct Manufacturing </td> <td> </td> <td>1,452 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,002 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>R,D&E </td> <td> </td> <td>4,476 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,907 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Temporary </td> <td> </td> <td>1,359 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,396 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssociates, net decreased by 1,331 to 7,543 from 8,874 during the full year 2020.

Non-controlling interest is not included in this table.\nOperating lease obligations: The Company leases certain offices, manufacturing and research buildings, machinery, automobiles and data processing and other equipment. Such operating leases, some of which are non-cancelable and include renewals, expire on various dates. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nPension contribution requirements: The Company sponsors defined benefit plans that cover eligible employees in Japan, Canada, and France. In 2021, the expected contribution to all plans, including direct payments to retirees, is $2 million, of which the major contribution is $1 million for our Canada pension plans. Due to volatility associated with future changes in interest rates and plan asset returns, the Company cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing and amounts of future funding requirements, and therefore the above table shows expected contributions (to funded plans, or direct payments to retirees in the case of unfunded plans) for 2020, but only shows benefit payments (from funded plans, or direct to retirees in the case of unfunded plans) for 2021 and subsequent years. We may elect to make contributions in excess of the minimum funding requirements for the Japan, Canada, and France plans in response to investment performance and changes in interest rates, or when we believe that it is financially advantageous to do so and based on other capital requirements. This contribution amount does not include plans considered to be multiemployer with Autoliv. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 17, Retirement Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\n4% Convertible Senior Notes and Financial loans: On May 28, 2019, the Company issued, in a registered public offering in the U.S., 4% Convertible Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $207 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per year payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2019 and will mature on June 1, 2024, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.\nUnconditional purchase obligations: There are no material obligations other than short-term obligations related to inventory, services, tooling, and property, plant and equipment purchased in the ordinary course of business.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has considered all applicable recently issued accounting guidance. The Company has summarized in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included herein each of the recently issued accounting pronouncements and stated the impact or whether management is continuing to assess the impact.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe application of accounting policies necessarily requires judgments and the use of estimates by a Company's management. Actual results could differ from these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of\nuncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, and management's evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Certain policies relate to estimates that involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and different estimates or changes to an estimate could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Such critical estimates are discussed below. For these, materially different amounts could be reported under varied conditions and assumption. Other items in the Company's consolidated financial statements require estimation, however, in our judgment, they are not as critical as those discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, adjusted for any variable consideration (i.e. price concessions or annual price adjustments) and estimated at contract inception. The variable consideration calculation involves management assumptions including the volume of light vehicle production, future sales volumes for specific parts, or future price concessions to be granted. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product to a customer.\nIn addition, from time to time, Veoneer may make payments to customers in connection with ongoing and future business. These payments to customers are generally recognized as a reduction to revenue at the time of the commitment to make these payments, unless certain criteria are met that warrant capitalization. If the payments are capitalized, the amounts are amortized as the related goods are transferred. As of December 31, 2019, the Company capitalized $81 million and zero as of December 31, 2020 in Other current assets and Other non-current assets related to payments to customers. The Company assesses these amounts for impairment. The assets held as of December 31, 2019 were reclassified to Assets Held for Sale during 2020 and impaired as part of the evaluation of the value less costs to sell of that asset group. See Note 6 Divestiture and Held for Sale for additional information. No impairment was recorded in 2019 or 2018.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nShipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control of a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of sales.\nNature of goods and services\nThe following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue. Subsequent to the divestiture of the majority of the Brake Systems business during 2020, the Company has one operating segment, Electronics. This segment includes all of electronics resources and expertise, Restraint Control Systems and Active Safety, and primarily generates revenue from the sale of production parts and engineering services to OEMs.\nThe Company accounts for individual products separately if they are distinct (i.e., if a product is separately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including any price concession or annual price adjustments, is based on their stand-alone selling prices for each of the products. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the cost-plus margin approach.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for production parts primarily at a point in time.\nFor production parts with revenue recognized at a point in time, the Company recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customers and transfer of title and risk of loss under standard commercial terms (typically F.O.B. shipping point). There are certain contracts where the criteria to recognize revenue over time have been met (e.g., there is no alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment). In such cases, at period end, the Company recognizes revenue and a related asset and associated cost of goods sold and inventory. However, the financial impact of these contracts is immaterial considering the very short production cycles and limited inventory days on hand, which is typical for the automotive industry.\nThe amount of revenue recognized is based on the purchase order price and adjusted for variable consideration (i.e. price concessions or annual price adjustments). Customers typically pay for the production parts based on customary business practices with payment terms averaging 30 days.\nContract balances\nThe contract assets related to the Company's rights to consideration for work completed but not billed (generally in conjunction with contracts for which revenue is recognized over time) at the reporting date on production parts. The contract assets are\nreclassified into the receivables balance when the rights to receive payments become unconditional. There have been no impairment losses recognized related to contract assets arising from the Company's contracts with customers.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has capitalized $12 million of direct and incremental contract costs incurred in connection with obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs will be amortized as the related goods are transferred. There were no contract assets capitalized as of December 31, 2020.\nReceivables\nAccounts receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.\nThe Company has evaluated the available adoption options of common credit loss methods that are acceptable as per FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326, Credit Losses. The Company adopted the available Loss-rate method where the impairment is calculated using an estimated loss rate and multiplying it by the asset's amortized cost at the balance sheet date. This method appropriately reflects the Company\u00b4s risk pattern in relation to its accounts receivables.\nThe key components of the Company's Loss-rate model are as follows:\n\u2022A list of the Company's customers credit rating and credit default risk rate from Bloomberg.\n\u2022Actual write-offs or reversals of previous write-offs of accounts receivables.\n\u2022Evaluation of other unusual facts and circumstances which could impact the credit loss rate, such as risk of bankruptcy or potential collectability issues.\nThe Company's credit loss model includes the Company's customer list. The customer list captures the existing customers. The list is put into a Bloomberg data query to generate customers short-term credit rating. The credit default risk rate is used to calculate the credit loss rate or estimated loss rate.\nFor customers that do not have credit default risk rate, management uses the six-month LIBOR rate as a credit rating and a credit default risk rate. Management believes that the six-month LIBOR rate adequately reflects the short-term nature of the Company's trade receivables and is also in line with the Company's invoice payment terms.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. In addition, an acquisition may include a contingent consideration component. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price. Each quarter this contingent consideration is re-measured using the discounted cash flow method.\nThe Company uses actual revenue levels as well as changes in the estimated probability of different revenue scenarios to estimate fair values. The Company has engaged outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. The Company adjusts the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as the Company obtains more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\nThe Company's purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies.\nOther estimates used in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, future cash flows or income related to intangibles, market rate assumptions, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates. The Company estimates the fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but these are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.\nEquity Method Investments\nThe Company initially accounts for an equity method investment at its fair value on the date of acquisition. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12,\"Equity Method Investment\" to the consolidated financial statements included.\nInventory Reserves\nInventories are evaluated based on individual or, in some cases, groups of inventory items. Reserves are established to reduce the value of inventories to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Excess inventories are quantities of items that exceed anticipated sales or usage for a reasonable period. The Company has guidelines for calculating provisions for excess inventories based on the number of months of inventories on hand compared to anticipated sales or usage. Management uses its judgment to forecast sales or usage and to determine what constitutes a reasonable period.\nThere can be no assurance that the amount ultimately realized for inventories will not be materially different than that assumed in the calculation of the reserves.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nThe Company evaluates the carrying value and useful lives of long-lived assets when indications of impairment are evident or it is likely that the useful lives have decreased, in which case the Company depreciates the assets over the remaining useful lives. Impairment testing is primarily performed by using the cash flow method based on undiscounted future cash flows. Estimated undiscounted cash flows for a long-lived asset being evaluated for recoverability are compared with the respective carrying amount of that asset. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the assets, the carrying amounts of the long-lived asset are considered recoverable and an impairment is not recorded. However, if the carrying amount of a group of assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an entity must then estimate, generally using a discounted cash flow model the long-lived assets' fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized.\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. The impairment test was performed in October 2020.\nIn conducting its impairment testing, the Company compares the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to the related carrying value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of carrying amount over the fair value of the respective reporting unit.\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the discounted cash flow method taking into account expected long-term operating cash-flow performance. The Company discounts projected operating cash flows using the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, including a risk premium to adjust for market risk. The Company's assumptions in conducting its impairment testing include revenue growth rates, Earnings Before Income Tax (\"EBIT\") margin rate in the discrete and terminal period and the discount rate applied to the future cash flows. The estimated fair value is based on automotive industry volume projections which are based on third-party and internally developed forecasts and discount rate assumptions. To supplement this analysis, the Company compares the market value of its equity, calculated by reference to the quoted market prices of its shares, to the estimated fair values of its reporting units.\nRecall Provisions and Warranty Obligations\nThe Company records liabilities for product recalls when probable claims are identified and when it is possible to reasonably estimate costs. Recall costs are costs incurred when the customer decides to formally recall a product due to a known or suspected safety concern. Product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer's cost of the recall, including labor to remove and replace the defective part. In some cases, portions of the product recall costs are reimbursed by an insurance company. Actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated, requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods. It is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nEstimating warranty obligations requires the Company to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold. The Company bases the estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts, combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis. Actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing\nreserves in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nVeoneer's employees participate in defined benefit plans sponsored by Autoliv and certain defined benefit plans sponsored by Veoneer in Japan (the Japan plans), France (the France plans), and Canada (the Canada plans).\nFor the Japan, French, and Canada plans, the amount recognized as a defined benefit liability is the net total of projected benefit obligation (PBO) minus the fair value of plan assets (if any). The plan assets are measured at fair value. Net periodic benefit cost was reported within Costs of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses and RD&E expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nVeoneer has considered the remaining plans to be part of a multiemployer plan with Autoliv. Pension expense was allocated for these plans and reported within Costs of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses and RD&E expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nOf the plans sponsored by Veoneer, the most significant plans are the France plans. These plans represent approximately 34% of the Company's total pension benefit obligation. See Note 17, Retirement Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nThe Company, in consultation with its actuarial advisors, determines certain key assumptions to be used in calculating the projected benefit obligation and annual pension expense. For the France plans, the assumptions used for calculating the 2020 pension expense were a discount rate of 0.9%, expected rate of increase in compensation levels of 2.5%.\nThe discount rate for the Japanese plans has been set based on the rates of return of high-quality fixed-income investments currently available at the measurement date and are expected to be available during the period the benefits will be paid. The expected rate of increase in compensation levels and long-term return on plan assets are determined based on a number of factors and must take into account long-term expectations and reflect the financial environment in the respective local markets. This plan does not have assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Many of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany transactions. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation, Note 19, Income Taxes and Note 22, Relationship with Former Parent and Related Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nAlthough the Company believes that its tax return positions are supportable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on the income tax provisions or benefits in the periods in which such determinations are made. See also the discussion of the determinations of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets in Note 19, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nContingent Liabilities\nVarious claims, lawsuits and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries, covering a range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities with respect to commercial, product liability or other matters. For a discussion of legal matters we are involved in, see Note 16, \"Commitment and Contingencies\", to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nThe Company diligently defends itself in such matters and, in addition, carries insurance coverage to the extent reasonably available against insurable risks.\nThe Company records liabilities for claims, lawsuits and proceedings when they are probable, and it is possible to reasonably estimate the cost of such liabilities. Legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as such costs are incurred.\nA loss contingency is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued management\nevaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nLeases\nLease Classification\nThe Company, as a lessee, determine the lease classification for each separate lease component at the lease commencement date. Commencement date is defined as the date on which a lessor makes an underlying asset available for use by the Company. This date can be different from the stated commencement date in the contract. This date is when Veoneer takes possession of or be given control over the use of an underlying asset. For lessees, a lease can be classified either as an operating lease or a finance lease.\nInitial Measurement\nThe Company will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at lease commencement. The lease liability for both finance and operating leases equals the present value of the unpaid lease payments, discounted at Veoneer's incremental borrowing rate.\nLease payment includes undiscounted fixed (including in-substance fixed) payments plus optional payments (e.g. for purchase options, optional renewal periods, periods subsequent to a termination option) that are reasonably certain to be owed. Lease payments do not include variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, any guarantee by the lessee of the lessor's debt; or amounts allocated to non-lease components.\nThe incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. In general, the discount rate will not be reassessed unless there is a change in the lease term or in the assessment of a lessee purchase option represent a significant change in the economics of the arrangement.\nShort-term Lease & Low Value Lease Recognition Exemption\nA short-term lease is a lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.\nFor leases that meet the definition of short-term\u201d, the Company elected the practical expedient under ASC 842 which allows for simplified accounting. The practical expedient will apply for all classes of underlying assets and under the practical expedient, the Company will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term and will disclose the costs. In addition, the Company determined that the expenses derived from leases with lease term of one month or less will be exempt from being assessed under lease recognition.\nImpairment test\nThe Company will use the long-lived assets impairment guidance (ASC 360) to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired, and if so, the amount of the impairment loss to recognize. The impairment loss related to a right-of-use asset is presented in the same manner in the income statement as an impairment loss recognized for any other long-lived asset.\nAssets and liabilities held for sale\nThe Company classifies assets and liabilities (disposal groups) to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond the Company's control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nThe Company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale.", "summary": "The MD&A report provides an overview of Veoneer's business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIntroduction\nThe following MD&A is intended to help you understand the business operations and financial condition of the Company. This MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n\u2022Executive Overview\n\u2022Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities\n\u2022Market Overview\n\u2022Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\u2022Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nVeoneer is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices in Stockholm, Sweden. The Company functions as a holding corporation and owns two principal operating subsidiaries, Veoneer AB and Veoneer US, Inc. On June 29, 2018, the Spin-Off of Veoneer from Autoliv, Inc. (\"Autoliv\") was completed through the distribution by Autoliv of all the outstanding shares of common stock of Veoneer to Autoliv's stockholders as of the close of business on June 12, 2018, the common stock record date for the distribution, in a tax-free, pro rata distribution (the \"Spin-Off\"). On July 2, 2018, the shares of Veoneer common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VNE\u201d and the Veoneer Swedish Depository Receipts representing shares of Veoneer common stock commenced trading on Nasdaq Stockholm under the symbol VNE SDB.\u201d\nVeoneer is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture, and sale of automotive safety electronics with a focus on innovation, quality and manufacturing excellence. Prior to the Spin-Off, Veoneer operated for almost four years as an operating segment within Autoliv. Veoneer's safety systems are designed to make driving safer and easier, more comfortable and convenient for the end consumer and to intervene before a potential collision. Veoneer endeavors to prevent vehicle accidents or reduce the severity of impact in the event a crash is unavoidable. Through our customer focus, being an expert partner with our customers, we intend to develop human centric systems that benefit automotive light vehicle occupants.\nVeoneer's current product offering includes automotive radars, mono-and stereo-vision cameras, night driving assist (thermal sensing) systems, Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) electronic control units, passive safety electronics (airbag control units, crash sensors and seat belt pre-tensioner electronic controllers), brake control systems, brake control electronic controllers, and a complete ADAS software offering including perception and driving policy (ArriverTM) towards highly automated driving (HAD) and eventually autonomous driving (AD). In addition, we offer driver monitoring systems, LiDAR sensors, RoadScape positioning systems and other technologies critical for ADAS, HAD and AD solutions by leveraging our partnership network and internally developed intellectual property.\nExecutive Overview\nThe fourth quarter saw an unfortunate resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to put the health and safety of our people first, reinforcing our measures that were first put in place in the beginning of the pandemic, and we believe that the global efforts and vaccinations that have now started will allow the situation to gradually improve throughout 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020 Veoneer saw organic growth for the first time, a pivotal moment for the Company. The strong growth was driven by new launches and a stronger development of the light vehicle production than anticipated in the beginning of the quarter. We further continued our strong focus on efficiencies and financial management, which allowed us to finish the year in a stronger cash position than anticipated. Despite some initial additional launch related costs, our ability to deliver new products and technologies to recently launched vehicle platforms in the current uncertain environment was an outstanding achievement.\nDuring 2020, we experienced dramatic declines in the vehicle production during the first half, and an unprecedented rebound in the second half. This global development, which was witnessed across multiple industries, has created serious challenges for supply of electronic components. Relatively speaking, we believe we have managed this situation well, but we do expect the tightness in supply to affect the global light vehicle production during the first half of 2021. Currently, the effects are difficult to quantify, and we monitor and manage this situation daily.\nDuring the fourth quarter we negotiated, and in January 2021 finalized an agreement with Qualcomm to build a world leading solution in ADAS and AD, which we anticipate will be ready for commercial launches in 2024. To build this business we have created Arriver\u2122, our new software unit and brand which will be fully focused on further developing perception, fusion and drive policy software for the next generation cars. It builds on more than a decade of experience in Active Safety development and for drive policy software on previous cooperation with Volvo Cars (VCC) in the Zenuity joint venture. It will deliver an open, scalable and flexible architecture solution running on Qualcomm's next generation Snapdragon Ride\u2122 System on a Chip (SoC) platform. Our joint expectation is to create a leading ADAS and AD solution, which over time, will form the core of one of the leading ecosystems for automation in our industry. With Qualcomm having the lead go-to-market responsibility, we are already receiving very positive feedback from initial presentations to vehicle OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers.\nThe trend of a changing automotive industry is stronger than ever. Veoneer is right in the middle of this development and we have recently taken critical steps to position our company for the future. We have divested our brake control business, dissolved our joint venture with VCC, and now created Arriver\u2122. We are also revisiting our Lidar strategy as we see rapid changes in the core technology development. For example, on January 25, 2021 Veoneer received a cancellation notice from an autonomous vehicle customer due to a change in their core Lidar technology. We are evaluating several new opportunities for Veoneer as a lidar system integrator and industrialization partner for new lidar startups.\nWith health and safety as our first priority, our focus remains to be on flawless daily execution, winning new profitable business and building a world leading technology portfolio.\n2021 Outlook and Mid-Term Targets Update\nThe macro-economic environment remains very uncertain, mainly due to the global supply chain challenges created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These global supply chain shortages have led multiple OEM customers to reduce their production schedules on short notice, which in turn makes the global LVP very difficult to forecast. Due to this fluid situation, we believe the latest IHS Markit production forecast may be optimistic for the first quarter of 2021. Our indication for the first quarter of 2021 is that our organic sales (non-U.S. GAAP measure) are expected to out-perform the global LVP as compared to the same quarter in 2020 and sequentially from the fourth quarter in 2020 also out-perform the global LVP.\nFor the full year 2021, we expect our organic sales growth (non-U.S. GAAP measure) to exceed 25% and a currency translation, net increase of 5%, both as compared to 2020. Also for full year 2021, we estimate Active Safety organic sales growth to be approximately 45%. We anticipate positive leverage on this organic sales growth during 2021 to improve our gross margin, however, this leverage improvement is expected to be more weighted toward the second half of 2021.\nThe current RD&E, net run rate, after the completion of various MAI program initiatives, is now expected to be in the range of $110 to $120 million per quarter as we head into 2021, while capital expenditures and depreciation are expected to be approximately $100 million and $115 million, respectively, for the full year 2021. As a result of these underlying assumptions, we expect our operating loss for the full year 2021 to improve as compared to 2020, and we expect our cash balance to be more than $400 million at 2021 year-end. We also expect our operating loss and cash flow performance to improve sequentially during 2021. Veoneer expects its order intake in terms of annual average sales and lifetime sales to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nLooking beyond 2021 to our mid-term targets, we expect Veoneer's strong organic sales to continue and now expect net sales to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2023, based on our strong order intake over the last several years and order book of approximately $14 billion. The Company expects to arrive to a sustainable operating profit and positive free cash flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure) during 2023.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Commentary\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause significant uncertainty in the global economy. This includes the automotive industry and the global LVP for 2021 and the upcoming years ahead, which are dependent on underlying consumer demand.\nAs our OEM customers recovered to more normal volumes, or higher than normal volumes in certain countries, we have returned to higher production levels as well. The health and safety of our associates continues to be our first priority, and we are taking the necessary actions to protect our associates, safeguard our operations and meet our customers' needs while managing through these unprecedented circumstances.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our customers in Europe and North America generally stabilized their production, after most factories had been idled, or running on very reduced schedules, during the latter part of the first quarter and the early part of the second quarter. However, during the fourth quarter, we experienced an even stronger increase in production ramp-ups by our customers in China, while the production in other Asian vehicle producing countries has stabilized from the initial recovery during the second quarter of 2020. The strong customer call-offs in China have continued into the first quarter of 2021 and continue to create challenges in the supply chain for certain key components in our restraint control business.\nWe believe our latest planning assumptions, primarily based on our customer call-offs and forecasts, reflect a lower global LVP for Q1'21 due to the fact that we foresee more customer production interruptions, due to global supply base constraints, than reflected in the latest IHS Markit projections as of January 18, 2021. The latest IHS Markit forecast indicates a YoY LVP increase of approximately 14% for Q1'21 and a 13% sequential decline from Q4'20. We continue to monitor the global supply base very closely as well as the overall COVID-19 pandemic situation for potential impacts to our business.\nFor 2020 and the upcoming years, the most important driver for Veoneer's business is new customer and technology launches, which should drive significant out-performance as compared to the global LVP.\nAs noted in our 2020 results, in response to the pandemic, the Company continues to extend its MAIs to further mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its cash flow and operating results. The actions taken by the Company to mitigate the impact, including reducing its annual RD&E, net by more than $100 million and other expenses while reducing the Company's operating loss and conserving cash in 2020, resulted in a cash balance of $758 million for the year-ending 2020.\nTrends, Uncertainties and Opportunities\nTrend toward Collaborative Driving\nThe market around us continues to change rapidly, shifting towards a more autotech environment from the traditional automotive industry. The industry developments during the last two years have further strengthened the trend toward advanced driver support - Collaborative Driving - and away from fully autonomous cars for the consumer based vehicle mass market.\nNew technologies, creating new levels of interaction and driver support are once again revolutionizing the driving experience; however we believe the driver will remain actively involved for many years to come. While the industry refers to Level 2+\u201d or even \"Level 2++\" Veoneer calls this Collaborative Driving, and includes any Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) level of automation. At the same time there is a growing realization that the introduction of truly self-driving cars will likely take longer and be more expensive than previously anticipated. This fundamental insight opens up new opportunities for companies, including Veoneer, but it also requires adjusting resource priorities. As such, we believe that the market will stay mainly focused on Level 1-Level 2+ automated driving solutions for the next decade however, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our industry during the first half of 2020, and any potential future impact of the pandemic on economic conditions could affect the evolution of ADAS, Collaborative Driving and AD for consumer purchased light vehicles.\nGlobal Regulatory and Test Rating Developments\nEurope continues to take a proactive role in promoting or requiring Active Safety technologies. The European New Car Assessment Program ( NCAP\u201d) continuously updates its test rating program to include more active safety technologies to help the European Union reach its target of cutting road fatalities by 50% by 2030, as compared to 2020.\nOne June 26, 2020, the UNECE's World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, announced the first binding international regulation on level 3\u201d vehicle automation. The new regulation marks an important step towards the wider deployment of automated vehicles to help realize a vision of safer, more sustainable mobility for all. Starting in January 2021 the regulation provides guidelines on the Automated Lane Keep System (\"ALKS\") feature, requires driver availability recognition systems, and a \"black box\" data storage system for AD. It also outlines requirements for emergency and minimal risk maneuvers and driver transition demand as well as cyber-security and software update protocols.\nIn May 2020 Euro NCAP announced that it was postponing the roll-out of upcoming road map updates by one year (from 2022 to 2023 and from 2024 to 2025). This should help our industry to overcome the situation with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it should not change the overall trend towards introduction of new roadmap requirements, which are just delayed by one year. We anticipate strong global sensor adoption rate increases (forward, side and rear) due to the European NCAP's push for crash avoidance, increased adoption rates due to growing demand around ADAS software features, volume growth due to redundant sensing concepts needed for higher levels of autonomy, potential opportunities in\nrelation to compliance with cyber-security and software updates and step-by-step increased demand for connectivity components as a result.\nOn May 17, 2018, the European Commission proposed a new mandate, as part of the European General Safety Regulation (\"GSR\") road-map through 2028, to make certain Active Safety features compulsory in light vehicles by 2022. During March of 2019 the EU mandate was adopted as initially proposed by the European Commission. We believe that adoption of the mandate will significantly expand demand for our Active Safety products. Indeed, with respect to sensors and ADAS software features, our order intake since the adoption of the mandate seems to reflect the anticipated increase in demand. However, during 2019 we saw some OEMs delays in the sourcing of these technologies as customers reconsidered how they want to architect and design, in a scalable way to include these new standard technologies. In addition, we believe that the mandate and the European GSR generally will influence other market regulators as they evaluate their respective vehicle test rating programs and safety legislation.\nIn China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Key Working Points of Intelligent Connected Vehicle Standardization for 2018 to promote and facilitate the development of the intelligent connected vehicles industry, and advance the development of fundamental standards and those that are in urgent demand. The guideline has pointed out that more than 30 key standards will be defined by 2020 to fund the systems for ADAS and low-level autonomous driving, and a system of over 100 standards will be set up by 2025 for higher level autonomous driving.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, the Chinese government commenced testing of new vehicles according to the new China New Car Assessment Program where active safety features like Autonomous Emergency Braking (\"AEB\") are required to achieve the maximum safety rating.\nThe Chinese Government is also aiming for half of the vehicles sold by 2025 to be equipped with partial self-driving technology according to their updated Made in China 2025\u201d program announced in November 2020. Furthermore the goal is to have Level 2\u201d and Level 3\u201d semi-autonomous driving technology installed in 70% of the cars by 2030.\nOn October 4, 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DoT\") issued new voluntary guidelines on automated driving systems (\"ADS\") under its Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0\u201d initiative, building on its Vision for Safety 2.0\u201d from September 2017, which prioritized aligning federal guidance around twelve safety design elements of interest to the auto industry. This initiative should have a positive impact on the adoption of ADAS and HAD on the road towards Autonomous Vehicles (\"AV\").\nOn April 2, 2020 the DoT closed the comment period for the Automated Vehicles 4.0\u201d which seeks to ensure a consistent U.S. Government approach to AV technologies, and to detail the authorities, research, and investments being made across the United States so that the United States can continue to lead AV technology research, development, and integration.\nIn 2018 the UN Economic Commission for Europe created a new Working Party to deal with regulations for Automated/Autonomous and Connected Vehicles. In addition to the EU and Japan, which have both started to work closely together to develop ADAS regulations, in the last three years, the U.S. and China becoming more active in several working groups towards harmonization of future regulations for ADAS and AV. This would create a common umbrella for countries which follow type-approval rules (EU, Japan, Australia) and countries which are outside of type-approval system, e.g., under self-certification regimes (U.S., Korea) or specific national rules (China).\nKey upcoming regulations are (i) safety critical ADAS-features (e.g. AEB); (ii) Highway AV-features (Physical and Virtual Tests + Real World Test Drive + Audit); (iii) Cyber-security and Software updates; and in subsequent-step for (iv) Connected Vehicles. On one hand, the agreement on minimal common base requirements for the industry will take a longer time and therefore may postpone introduction of regulations. On the other hand, the harmonization with base requirements would help the industry while a more active position from China may help to pull forward some safety critical ADAS technologies which are not yet considered as relevant for regulation in EU and Japan (e.g. Blind Spot or Night).\nMarket Overview\n\nFor the full year of 2020, the global light vehicle production (according to IHS Markit) declined by approximately 17% as compared to 2019. The main driver of this sharp decline was primarily due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative pandemic effects mostly impacted North America and Europe from mid-March through May and Asia from February through mid-April. As a result all major vehicle producing countries or regions decline in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nThis decline is approximately 16 percentage points lower than expected at the beginning of 2020, and is the largest single year decline since the financial crisis in 2009. Within the Americas North America declined 21%, while within Rest of Asia South Korea declined 10%, and lastly within Europe, Western Europe declined 25% while Eastern Europe declined 16%.\nThis is the third consecutive annual decline in light vehicle production from 2017 when a record 92 million vehicles were produced. The most recent IHS Markit 2021 outlook is for global light vehicle production to rebound and increase approximately 13% from 2020 levels to 82 million vehicles in 2021. North America, Western Europe and China are expected to be the largest contributors to the increase in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-U.S. GAAP financial measures are reconciled throughout this report.\nIn this report we refer to organic sales or changes in organic sales growth, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that we, investors and analysts use to analyze the Company's sales trends and performance. We believe that this measure assists investors and management in analyzing trends in the Company's business because the Company generates approximately 66% of its sales in currencies other than in U.S. dollars (its reporting currency) and currency rates have been and can be rather volatile. The Company has historically made several acquisitions and divestitures, although none that impacted the reporting periods in question. Organic sales and organic sales growth represent the increase or decrease in the overall U.S. dollar net sales on a comparable basis, allowing separate discussions of the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and exchange rates on the Company's performance. The tables in this report present the reconciliation of changes in the total U.S. GAAP net sales to changes in organic sales growth.\nThe Company uses in this report EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which represents the Company's net income excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and including loss from equity method investment. The tables below provide reconciliations of net income (loss) to EBITDA.\nThe Company uses in this report net working capital, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which is defined as current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) minus current liabilities excluding short-term debt and net assets and liabilities held for sale. The Company also uses in this report cash flow before financing activities, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net cash used in operating activities plus net cash used in investing activities. The Company also uses in this report free cash flow a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Management uses these measures to improve its ability to assess operating performance at a point in time as well as the trends over time. The tables set forth in Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non U.S. GAAP\u201d below provide a reconciliation of current assets and liabilities to net working capital, cash flow before financing activities and free cash flow.\nInvestors should not consider these non-U.S. GAAP measures as substitutes, but rather as additions, to financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures, as defined, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nForward-looking non-U.S. GAAP financial measures used in this report are provided on a non-U.S. GAAP basis. Veoneer has not provided a U.S. GAAP reconciliation of these measures because items that impact these measures, such as foreign currency exchange rates and future investing activities, cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts and Veoneer is unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2020 compared to 2019\nThe following tables show Veoneer's performance by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 along with components of change compared to the prior year. As a result of the completion of its strategic initiatives during 2020, starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 Veoneer is organized into one product area Safety Electronics, which includes Restraint Control Systems and Active Safety. Although the Company continues to sell legacy Brakes Systems to Honda as well as component Brake ECUs to ZF this is not a separate segment as it is immaterial to Veoneer's overall business\n\n1 Non-U.S. GAAP measure reconciliation for Organic Sales and EBITDA\nNet Sales - Net sales for the Electronics segment decreased by $227 million to $1,303 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. This sales decline was mainly due to the organic sales1 decline in Active Safety and Restraint Control Systems of $155 million and $94 million, respectively, along with the currency translation effects of $13 million.\nOperating Loss - Operating loss for the Electronics segment of $268 million for the year ended December 31 2020 decreased by $56 million as compared to 2019. This improvement was primarily due to the higher than normal engineering reimbursements, lower RD&E gross, including the costs related to the Zenuity software team, which was previously reported in the equity method loss, and strategic initiative recoveries. All of these helped to mitigate the negative LVP impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, and volume and product mix effects causing the lower organic sales for the segment.\nEBITDA1 - EBITDA loss for Electronics segment decreased by $75 million to negative $167 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. This change is mainly due to the decrease in operating loss for the segment while depreciation and amortization increased by $19 million mainly due to previous investments for growth.\nAssociates - Associates, net in the Electronics segment decreased by 4 net to 7,380 as compared to full year 2019. Overall reductions were mostly offset by the additional Zenuity software associates of approximately 225.\nDeliveries - Deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2020 Restraint Controls Systems and Active Safety were 13 and 7.2 million units, respectively.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

The Company functions as a holding corporation and owns two principal operating subsidiaries, Veoneer AB and Veoneer US, Inc. On June 29, 2018, the Spin-Off of Veoneer from Autoliv, Inc. (\"Autoliv\") was completed through the distribution by Autoliv of all the outstanding shares of common stock of Veoneer to Autoliv's stockholders as of the close of business on June 12, 2018, the common stock record date for the distribution, in a tax-free, pro rata distribution (the \"Spin-Off\"). On July 2, 2018, the shares of Veoneer common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VNE\u201d and the Veoneer Swedish Depository Receipts representing shares of Veoneer common stock commenced trading on Nasdaq Stockholm under the symbol VNE SDB.\u201d\nVeoneer is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture, and sale of automotive safety electronics with a focus on innovation, quality and manufacturing excellence. Prior to the Spin-Off, Veoneer operated for almost four years as an operating segment within Autoliv. Veoneer's safety systems are designed to make driving safer and easier, more comfortable and convenient for the end consumer and to intervene before a potential collision. Veoneer endeavors to prevent vehicle accidents or reduce the severity of impact in the event a crash is unavoidable. Through our customer focus, being an expert partner with our customers, we intend to develop human centric systems that benefit automotive light vehicle occupants.\nVeoneer's current product offering includes automotive radars, mono-and stereo-vision cameras, night driving assist (thermal sensing) systems, Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) electronic control units, passive safety electronics (airbag control units, crash sensors and seat belt pre-tensioner electronic controllers), brake control systems, brake control electronic controllers, and a complete ADAS software offering including perception and driving policy (ArriverTM) towards highly automated driving (HAD) and eventually autonomous driving (AD). In addition, we offer driver monitoring systems, LiDAR sensors, RoadScape positioning systems and other technologies critical for ADAS, HAD and AD solutions by leveraging our partnership network and internally developed intellectual property.\nExecutive Overview\nThe fourth quarter saw an unfortunate resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to put the health and safety of our people first, reinforcing our measures that were first put in place in the beginning of the pandemic, and we believe that the global efforts and vaccinations that have now started will allow the situation to gradually improve throughout 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020 Veoneer saw organic growth for the first time, a pivotal moment for the Company. The strong growth was driven by new launches and a stronger development of the light vehicle production than anticipated in the beginning of the quarter. We further continued our strong focus on efficiencies and financial management, which allowed us to finish the year in a stronger cash position than anticipated. Despite some initial additional launch related costs, our ability to deliver new products and technologies to recently launched vehicle platforms in the current uncertain environment was an outstanding achievement.\nDuring 2020, we experienced dramatic declines in the vehicle production during the first half, and an unprecedented rebound in the second half. This global development, which was witnessed across multiple industries, has created serious challenges for supply of electronic components. Relatively speaking, we believe we have managed this situation well, but we do expect the tightness in supply to affect the global light vehicle production during the first half of 2021. Currently, the effects are difficult to quantify, and we monitor and manage this situation daily.\nDuring the fourth quarter we negotiated, and in January 2021 finalized an agreement with Qualcomm to build a world leading solution in ADAS and AD, which we anticipate will be ready for commercial launches in 2024. To build this business we have created Arriver\u2122, our new software unit and brand which will be fully focused on further developing perception, fusion and drive policy software for the next generation cars. It builds on more than a decade of experience in Active Safety development and for drive policy software on previous cooperation with Volvo Cars (VCC) in the Zenuity joint venture. It will deliver an open, scalable and flexible architecture solution running on Qualcomm's next generation Snapdragon Ride\u2122 System on a Chip (SoC) platform. Our joint expectation is to create a leading ADAS and AD solution, which over time, will form the core of one of the leading ecosystems for automation in our industry. With Qualcomm having the lead go-to-market responsibility, we are already receiving very positive feedback from initial presentations to vehicle OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers.\nThe trend of a changing automotive industry is stronger than ever. Veoneer is right in the middle of this development and we have recently taken critical steps to position our company for the future. We have divested our brake control business, dissolved our joint venture with VCC, and now created Arriver\u2122. We are also revisiting our Lidar strategy as we see rapid changes in the core technology development. For example, on January 25, 2021 Veoneer received a cancellation notice from an autonomous vehicle customer due to a change in their core Lidar technology. We are evaluating several new opportunities for Veoneer as a lidar system integrator and industrialization partner for new lidar startups.\nWith health and safety as our first priority, our focus remains to be on flawless daily execution, winning new profitable business and building a world leading technology portfolio.\n2021 Outlook and Mid-Term Targets Update\nThe macro-economic environment remains very uncertain, mainly due to the global supply chain challenges created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These global supply chain shortages have led multiple OEM customers to reduce their production schedules on short notice, which in turn makes the global LVP very difficult to forecast. Due to this fluid situation, we believe the latest IHS Markit production forecast may be optimistic for the first quarter of 2021. Our indication for the first quarter of 2021 is that our organic sales (non-U.S. GAAP measure) are expected to out-perform the global LVP as compared to the same quarter in 2020 and sequentially from the fourth quarter in 2020 also out-perform the global LVP.\nFor the full year 2021, we expect our organic sales growth (non-U.S. GAAP measure) to exceed 25% and a currency translation, net increase of 5%, both as compared to 2020. Also for full year 2021, we estimate Active Safety organic sales growth to be approximately 45%. We anticipate positive leverage on this organic sales growth during 2021 to improve our gross margin, however, this leverage improvement is expected to be more weighted toward the second half of 2021.\nThe current RD&E, net run rate, after the completion of various MAI program initiatives, is now expected to be in the range of $110 to $120 million per quarter as we head into 2021, while capital expenditures and depreciation are expected to be approximately $100 million and $115 million, respectively, for the full year 2021. As a result of these underlying assumptions, we expect our operating loss for the full year 2021 to improve as compared to 2020, and we expect our cash balance to be more than $400 million at 2021 year-end. We also expect our operating loss and cash flow performance to improve sequentially during 2021. Veoneer expects its order intake in terms of annual average sales and lifetime sales to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nLooking beyond 2021 to our mid-term targets, we expect Veoneer's strong organic sales to continue and now expect net sales to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2023, based on our strong order intake over the last several years and order book of approximately $14 billion. The Company expects to arrive to a sustainable operating profit and positive free cash flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure) during 2023.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Commentary\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause significant uncertainty in the global economy. This includes the automotive industry and the global LVP for 2021 and the upcoming years ahead, which are dependent on underlying consumer demand.\nAs our OEM customers recovered to more normal volumes, or higher than normal volumes in certain countries, we have returned to higher production levels as well. The health and safety of our associates continues to be our first priority, and we are taking the necessary actions to protect our associates, safeguard our operations and meet our customers' needs while managing through these unprecedented circumstances.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our customers in Europe and North America generally stabilized their production, after most factories had been idled, or running on very reduced schedules, during the latter part of the first quarter and the early part of the second quarter. However, during the fourth quarter, we experienced an even stronger increase in production ramp-ups by our customers in China, while the production in other Asian vehicle producing countries has stabilized from the initial recovery during the second quarter of 2020. The strong customer call-offs in China have continued into the first quarter of 2021 and continue to create challenges in the supply chain for certain key components in our restraint control business.\nWe believe our latest planning assumptions, primarily based on our customer call-offs and forecasts, reflect a lower global LVP for Q1'21 due to the fact that we foresee more customer production interruptions, due to global supply base constraints, than reflected in the latest IHS Markit projections as of January 18, 2021. The latest IHS Markit forecast indicates a YoY LVP increase of approximately 14% for Q1'21 and a 13% sequential decline from Q4'20. We continue to monitor the global supply base very closely as well as the overall COVID-19 pandemic situation for potential impacts to our business.\nFor 2020 and the upcoming years, the most important driver for Veoneer's business is new customer and technology launches, which should drive significant out-performance as compared to the global LVP.\nAs noted in our 2020 results, in response to the pandemic, the Company continues to extend its MAIs to further mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its cash flow and operating results. The actions taken by the Company to mitigate the impact, including reducing its annual RD&E, net by more than $100 million and other expenses while reducing the Company's operating loss and conserving cash in 2020, resulted in a cash balance of $758 million for the year-ending 2020.\nTrends, Uncertainties and Opportunities\nTrend toward Collaborative Driving\nThe market around us continues to change rapidly, shifting towards a more autotech environment from the traditional automotive industry. The industry developments during the last two years have further strengthened the trend toward advanced driver support - Collaborative Driving - and away from fully autonomous cars for the consumer based vehicle mass market.\nNew technologies, creating new levels of interaction and driver support are once again revolutionizing the driving experience; however we believe the driver will remain actively involved for many years to come. While the industry refers to Level 2+\u201d or even \"Level 2++\" Veoneer calls this Collaborative Driving, and includes any Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) level of automation. At the same time there is a growing realization that the introduction of truly self-driving cars will likely take longer and be more expensive than previously anticipated. This fundamental insight opens up new opportunities for companies, including Veoneer, but it also requires adjusting resource priorities. As such, we believe that the market will stay mainly focused on Level 1-Level 2+ automated driving solutions for the next decade however, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our industry during the first half of 2020, and any potential future impact of the pandemic on economic conditions could affect the evolution of ADAS, Collaborative Driving and AD for consumer purchased light vehicles.\nGlobal Regulatory and Test Rating Developments\nEurope continues to take a proactive role in promoting or requiring Active Safety technologies. The European New Car Assessment Program ( NCAP\u201d) continuously updates its test rating program to include more active safety technologies to help the European Union reach its target of cutting road fatalities by 50% by 2030, as compared to 2020.\nOne June 26, 2020, the UNECE's World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, announced the first binding international regulation on level 3\u201d vehicle automation. The new regulation marks an important step towards the wider deployment of automated vehicles to help realize a vision of safer, more sustainable mobility for all. Starting in January 2021 the regulation provides guidelines on the Automated Lane Keep System (\"ALKS\") feature, requires driver availability recognition systems, and a \"black box\" data storage system for AD. It also outlines requirements for emergency and minimal risk maneuvers and driver transition demand as well as cyber-security and software update protocols.\nIn May 2020 Euro NCAP announced that it was postponing the roll-out of upcoming road map updates by one year (from 2022 to 2023 and from 2024 to 2025). This should help our industry to overcome the situation with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it should not change the overall trend towards introduction of new roadmap requirements, which are just delayed by one year. We anticipate strong global sensor adoption rate increases (forward, side and rear) due to the European NCAP's push for crash avoidance, increased adoption rates due to growing demand around ADAS software features, volume growth due to redundant sensing concepts needed for higher levels of autonomy, potential opportunities in\nrelation to compliance with cyber-security and software updates and step-by-step increased demand for connectivity components as a result.\nOn May 17, 2018, the European Commission proposed a new mandate, as part of the European General Safety Regulation (\"GSR\") road-map through 2028, to make certain Active Safety features compulsory in light vehicles by 2022. During March of 2019 the EU mandate was adopted as initially proposed by the European Commission. We believe that adoption of the mandate will significantly expand demand for our Active Safety products. Indeed, with respect to sensors and ADAS software features, our order intake since the adoption of the mandate seems to reflect the anticipated increase in demand. However, during 2019 we saw some OEMs delays in the sourcing of these technologies as customers reconsidered how they want to architect and design, in a scalable way to include these new standard technologies. In addition, we believe that the mandate and the European GSR generally will influence other market regulators as they evaluate their respective vehicle test rating programs and safety legislation.\nIn China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Key Working Points of Intelligent Connected Vehicle Standardization for 2018 to promote and facilitate the development of the intelligent connected vehicles industry, and advance the development of fundamental standards and those that are in urgent demand. The guideline has pointed out that more than 30 key standards will be defined by 2020 to fund the systems for ADAS and low-level autonomous driving, and a system of over 100 standards will be set up by 2025 for higher level autonomous driving.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, the Chinese government commenced testing of new vehicles according to the new China New Car Assessment Program where active safety features like Autonomous Emergency Braking (\"AEB\") are required to achieve the maximum safety rating.\nThe Chinese Government is also aiming for half of the vehicles sold by 2025 to be equipped with partial self-driving technology according to their updated Made in China 2025\u201d program announced in November 2020. Furthermore the goal is to have Level 2\u201d and Level 3\u201d semi-autonomous driving technology installed in 70% of the cars by 2030.\nOn October 4, 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DoT\") issued new voluntary guidelines on automated driving systems (\"ADS\") under its Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0\u201d initiative, building on its Vision for Safety 2.0\u201d from September 2017, which prioritized aligning federal guidance around twelve safety design elements of interest to the auto industry.

The tables set forth in Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non U.S. GAAP\u201d below provide a reconciliation of current assets and liabilities to net working capital, cash flow before financing activities and free cash flow.\nInvestors should not consider these non-U.S. GAAP measures as substitutes, but rather as additions, to financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures, as defined, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nForward-looking non-U.S. GAAP financial measures used in this report are provided on a non-U.S. GAAP basis. Veoneer has not provided a U.S. GAAP reconciliation of these measures because items that impact these measures, such as foreign currency exchange rates and future investing activities, cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts and Veoneer is unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2020 compared to 2019\nThe following tables show Veoneer's performance by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 along with components of change compared to the prior year. As a result of the completion of its strategic initiatives during 2020, starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 Veoneer is organized into one product area Safety Electronics, which includes Restraint Control Systems and Active Safety. Although the Company continues to sell legacy Brakes Systems to Honda as well as component Brake ECUs to ZF this is not a separate segment as it is immaterial to Veoneer's overall business\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electronics Segment </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>Components of Change vs. Prior Year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions, (except where specified) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. GAAP Reported </td> <td> </td> <td>Currency </td> <td> </td> <td>Organic1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Chg. $ </td> <td> </td> <td>Chg. % </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(227) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(240) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Loss / Margin </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(268) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(324) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA1 / %\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(167) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(242) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Associates </td> <td>7,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Non-U.S. GAAP measure reconciliation for Organic Sales and EBITDA\nNet Sales - Net sales for the Electronics segment decreased by $227 million to $1,303 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. This sales decline was mainly due to the organic sales1 decline in Active Safety and Restraint Control Systems of $155 million and $94 million, respectively, along with the currency translation effects of $13 million.\nOperating Loss - Operating loss for the Electronics segment of $268 million for the year ended December 31 2020 decreased by $56 million as compared to 2019. This improvement was primarily due to the higher than normal engineering reimbursements, lower RD&E gross, including the costs related to the Zenuity software team, which was previously reported in the equity method loss, and strategic initiative recoveries. All of these helped to mitigate the negative LVP impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, and volume and product mix effects causing the lower organic sales for the segment.\nEBITDA1 - EBITDA loss for Electronics segment decreased by $75 million to negative $167 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. This change is mainly due to the decrease in operating loss for the segment while depreciation and amortization increased by $19 million mainly due to previous investments for growth.\nAssociates - Associates, net in the Electronics segment decreased by 4 net to 7,380 as compared to full year 2019. Overall reductions were mostly offset by the additional Zenuity software associates of approximately 225.\nDeliveries - Deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2020 Restraint Controls Systems and Active Safety were 13 and 7.2 million units, respectively.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brake Systems Segment </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td>Components of Change vs. Prior Year </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions,\n(except where specified) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. GAAP Reported </td> <td>Currency </td> <td> </td> <td>Divestiture </td> <td> </td> <td>Organic1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td>Chg. $ </td> <td> </td> <td>Chg.% </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(319) </td> <td> </td> <td>(86) </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(292) </td> <td> </td> <td>(78) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31) </td> <td> </td> <td>(53) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Loss / Margin </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> <td>(70.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td>-64 </td> <td>(17.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment EBITDA1 / Margin\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35)"}
