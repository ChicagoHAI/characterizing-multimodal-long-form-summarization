MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on this Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of novel neuromodulators for multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications. We are leveraging our proprietary portfolio of botulinum toxin type A compounds, formulated with our patented and proprietary peptide excipient technology, to address unmet needs in large and growing neuromodular markets. Our initial focus is on developing daxibotulinumtoxinA, our highly purified botulinum toxin Type A, for a broad spectrum of aesthetic and therapeutic indications, including facial wrinkles, muscle disorders, and chronic migraine.\nOur lead drug candidate is DAXI. We used our unique proprietary peptide excipient technology to formulate DAXI. The noncovalent bond formed between the proprietary peptide excipient technology and the botulinum toxin may enable longer residence time of botulinum toxin Type A, which could explain DAXI's long duration of effect. The process binds a highly purified botulinum toxin Type A with a unique proprietary stabilizing excipient peptide. We do not use human serum albumin and other animal-sourced ingredients, which carry the risk of transmission of pathogens, to stabilize our product.\nWe are currently studying DAXI for the treatment of facial wrinkles, cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, adult upper limb spasticity and chronic migraine. We believe DAXI has the potential to expand into additional aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the future. We also are developing a topically applied neuromodulator for aesthetic and therapeutic indications, DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, and have a collaboration and license agreement with Mylan to develop and commercialize a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae.\nDAXI\nWe are developing an injectable formulation of botulinum toxin type A, which we refer to as DAXI, for indications where a long-lasting effect is desired. We believe, and our preclinical and clinical studies using DAXI indicate, that daxibotulinumtoxinA combined with our novel peptide may safely achieve enhanced clinical efficacy and duration without an increase in associated adverse events. We are currently focusing on developing DAXI for the treatment of both aesthetic and therapeutic indications.\nGlabellar Lines\nThe glabella is the area between the eyebrows and above the nose. Glabellar lines, often called frown lines,\u201d are vertical lines that develop between the eyebrows and may appear as a single vertical line or as two or more lines. When one frowns, the muscles of the glabella contract causing vertical creases to form between the eyebrows. Botulinum toxin is used to temporarily block the ability of nerves to trigger contraction of injected muscle, inhibiting movement of the muscles that cause the frown lines, giving the skin a smoother, more refreshed appearance.\nIn 2015, we reported results from BELMONT, a Phase 2 active comparator, placebo-controlled clinical trial for the treatment of glabellar lines against BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic. The 24-week data showed that DAXI achieved its primary efficacy measurement for all doses of DAXI, and that such efficacy was highly statistically significant as compared to placebo. In addition, the 40 Unit dose of DAXI demonstrated a 23.6-week median duration versus BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic with an 18.8-week median duration. Across all cohorts, DAXI appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated.\nThe Phase 3 clinical program includes a) SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2, two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single administration of DAXI for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults and b) SAKURA 3, a long-term, open-label safety trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety of DAXI for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults following both single and repeat treatment administration. In December 2017, we announced top-line results for the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials. Both SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 met the primary composite endpoint by delivering highly statistically significant improvement against placebo in reducing the severity of glabellar lines. The percentage of DAXI-treated patients who had none or mild wrinkles and achieved at least a two-point improvement from baseline on both validated physician and patient assessments was 73.6 percent in SAKURA 1 and 74.0 percent in SAKURA 2 compared to placebo (p<0.0001) at Week 4. Also, at that time point, 88 percent of DAXI-treated patients in SAKURA 1 and 91 percent of DAXI patients in SAKURA 2 said they were very satisfied or satisfied with their treatment experience.\nThere were several secondary endpoints used to evaluate duration of effect, including the proportion of patients achieving none or mild response on IGA-FWS compared to placebo, median duration for time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS, and median duration for time to return to baseline on both IGA-FWS and PFWS. The percentage of DAXI-treated patients who achieved a none or mild response on IGA-FWS was 35.3 percent in SAKURA 1 and 29.4 percent at SAKURA 2 compared to placebo (p<0.0001) at Week 24. The median duration for time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS for DAXI-treated patients was 24.0 weeks for SAKURA 1 and 23.9 weeks for SAKURA 2. The median duration for time to return to baseline wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS for DAXI-treated patients was 27.7 weeks for SAKURA 1 and 26.0 weeks for SAKURA 2. For comparison, an additional exploratory duration endpoint was evaluated, which mirrors the duration measure used in the BELMONT Phase 2 study. This endpoint, was the median duration of greater or equal to 1 point improvement from baseline on IGA-FWS for DAXI-treated patients, and the results were 24.1 weeks for both SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2, and 23.6 weeks for BELMONT.\nIn December 2018, we announced top-line results for the SAKURA 3 open-label, long-term safety study. DAXI appeared to be generally well-tolerated, with no new tolerability or safety concerns reported. As was seen in the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials, adverse events were mild, localized and transient. The rate of treatment-related adverse events decreased over successive treatments. The most common treatment-related adverse events per treatment of DAXI were headache (3.3 percent of treatments), injection site pain (2.7 percent), injection site erythema (2.5 percent), and injection site oedema (2.2 percent). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Eyelid ptosis was reported in 0.9 percent of treatments, decreased in frequency with successive treatments and was substantially lower than the rate observed in SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 (2.2 percent of treatments). The majority of ptosis events were characterized as mild in severity (85 percent) and transient. A high degree of efficacy was seen consistently across all three treatment cycles. Results were consistent with SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 based on the IGA-FWS and PFWS scales. As early as Week 1, over 90 percent of subjects across all three treatments had none or mild wrinkles on the IGA-FWS. At Week 4, the percentage of DAXI-treated patients who achieved a none or mild response on IGA-FWS was 95.8 percent, 96.6 percent, and 97.7 percent for first, second and third treatment for SAKURA 3, respectively, and 97.5 percent for SAKURA 2 and SAKURA 1. On the more stringent 2-point composite endpoint, which was the primary efficacy endpoint in SAKURA 1 and 2, efficacy improved with successive treatment cycles: 73.2 percent, 77.7 percent, and 79.6 percent for first, second and third treatment of SAKURA 3, respectively, and 73.6 percent and 74.0 percent for SAKURA 1 and 2, respectively.\nAs in the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials, there were several secondary endpoints used to evaluate duration of effect, including median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS, and median duration for time to return to baseline wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS. Duration was evaluated in the first two 36-week treatment cycles; the third treatment cycle was not evaluated for duration as the observation period ended at twelve weeks for the purpose of this study. Median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS is 28.0 weeks and 28.1 weeks for first and second treatment of SAKURA 3, respectively, 27.7 weeks for SAKURA 1, and 26.0 weeks for SAKURA 2. Median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS is 24.0 weeks and 24.1 weeks for first and second treatment of SAKURA 3, respectively, 24.0 weeks for SAKURA 1, and 23.9 weeks for SAKURA 2. We held a pre-BLA meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) in December 2018, to agree upon the content and format of the BLA, which we plan to submit in first half of 2019. We plan to file marketing applications in the European Union, Canada, and certain Latin American and Asian countries after filing in the U.S.\nWe held a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA in December 2018, to agree upon the content and format of the BLA, which we plan to submit in first half of 2019.\nForehead Lines\nForehead lines are produced by the action of the frontalis muscle, a large, thin, vertically-oriented muscle which lifts the eyebrows. The frontalis muscle serves as an antagonist to the glabellar musculature, a natural depressor that is responsible for frowning and associated eyebrow movement. As the eyebrow is considered the aesthetic center of the upper face, forehead lines can significantly impact the aesthetic appearance of the face, contribute to increased signs of aging and convey unwanted social signals. However, both men and women have identified internal factors, such as wanting to look good for their age or having a more youthful appearance as very important and have prioritized forehead lines as bothersome areas for potential treatment regardless of age or available income. We initiated a Phase 2 study in forehead lines in January 2019.\nLateral Canthal Lines\nLCL, or \"crow's feet,\" are the spider-like fine lines around the outside corners of the eyes that become more obvious when someone smiles. These lines (also referred to as periorbital wrinkles, laugh lines or smile lines), fan out across the skin from the outer corner of each eye. Sometimes they extend down across the cheekbones to the lower cheeks. Repetitive motions, such as squinting and smiling, can lead to the increase of wrinkles and contribute to the severity and onset of crow's feet. Age and exposure to sun also play significant roles in development of these lines, which can deepen over time. Current treatments include anti-wrinkle eye creams and moisturizers, topical tretinoins, botulinum toxin injections, dermal fillers and laser treatments. BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic was approved to treat LCL in 2013, and is currently the only toxin approved for that use, though other toxins are used off-label. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in LCL in the first quarter of 2019.\nCervical Dystonia\nWe have been developing DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia, a muscle movement disorder. Muscle movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect a person's ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. In 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 dose-escalating, open-label clinical study of DAXI to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and duration of effect of DAXI in subjects with moderate to severe isolated cervical dystonia.\nIn May 2017, we announced positive 24 week topline results in all three cohorts from the Phase 2 trial. The topline data demonstrated a median duration of at least 24 weeks for each of the three cohorts. The topline data also displayed a clinically significant impact on cervical dystonia signs and symptoms. At Week 4, DAXI showed a clinically significant mean reduction of 38% from baseline across all three cohorts. This reduction continued to increase to 50% at Week 6 for all subjects, was 42% at Week 12 and was maintained at or above 30% through Week 24. The topline data also showed that DAXI appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated through Week 24 in all three cohorts. There were no serious adverse events and no dose-dependent increase in adverse events. The treatment-related adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate in severity, with one case of neck pain reported as severe. The most common adverse events were dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing (14 percent), of which all cases were mild in severity, injection site redness (8 percent), injection site bruising (5 percent), injection site pain (5 percent), muscle tightness (5 percent) and muscle weakness (5 percent).\nIn November 2017, the FDA granted orphan drug status to DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia in adults. Additionally, in November 2017, we completed our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and received scientific advice from the EMA regarding DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia.\nIn June 2018, we announced the initiation of patient dosing in our ASPEN Phase 3 clinical program based on the Phase 2 safety and efficacy results and guidance from the FDA and EMA. The ASPEN Phase 3 clinical program consists of two trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia in adults including: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial, and an open-label, long-term safety trial. The program is expected to enroll approximately 300 patients in the pivotal trial and 350 patients in the open-label trial at multiple sites in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The program is expected to complete enrollment by early 2020, and we expect to release topline results in the second half of 2020.\nPlantar Fasciitis\nIn 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of DAXI in the therapeutic indication of plantar fasciitis. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single administration of DAXI in reducing the signs and symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The study completed enrollment of 59 subjects in the U.S. in October 2017. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is the improvement in the AOFAS.\nIn January 2018, we announced the interim 8-week Phase 2a results for the plantar fasciitis trial. The trial's primary endpoint, the reduction in the patient-reported VAS for pain at Week 8, showed a robust impact on pain, with a greater than 50 percent reduction for patients treated with DAXI. In the intent-to-treat population, a mean reduction in the VAS score of 54.2 percent from baseline was achieved with DAXI, compared with a 42.6 percent reduction in the placebo group, which upon further subgroup analysis, was driven primarily by a strong placebo response in the control group at three of the five study sites. While the results are not statistically significant (p=0.39), DAXI provided patients with considerable pain relief. Similar numeric trends were seen in the secondary and exploratory endpoints. DAXI appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated through Week 8. The majority of adverse events in both treatment groups were mild in severity. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. The most common treatment-related adverse events for DAXI and placebo were injection site pain (10.0 percent and 10.3 percent) and muscle weakness (3.3 percent and 3.4 percent), both respectively, all of which were classified as mild in severity We completed the 16-week trial which showed a 58 percent reduction of pain from baseline along with a strong placebo response, with the difference between the treatment groups not being statistically significant.\nIn September 2018, we completed a Type C meeting with FDA discussing the design of the Phase 2 dose-finding study. We initiated another Phase 2 trial in December 2018. The Phase 2 prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of administration of our investigational drug candidate DAXI in reducing the signs and symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The study is expected to enroll approximately 150 adult patients with unilateral plantar fasciitis, from approximately 20 study centers in the U.S.. Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive an injection of a low dose, high dose or placebo. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in NPRS score at Week 8. Patients will be followed for up to 24 weeks post treatment to assess treatment response, tolerability and safety. We expect to complete enrollment in this Phase 2 trial during the second half of 2019 and release topline results in the second half of 2020.\nAdult Upper Limb Spasticity\nAdult upper limb spasticity is a chronic movement disorder (an inability to produce and control bodily movements), that presents as increased tone or stiffness of the muscles. Spasticity results from neurological insults (e.g., stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury) to the brain that control voluntary movement of the body, arms and legs. According to GIA, the global opportunity for botulinum toxin for the treatment of muscle movement disorders, which includes cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity, was estimated to be over $1.0 billion in 2017. We initiated a Phase 2b study (JUNIPER) in adult upper limb spasticity in December 2018, and we expect to release topline results in the second half of 2020.\nChronic Migraine\nMigraine headache is a central nervous system disorder characterized as moderate to severe headache and often includes other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Migraine headache affects more than 38 million people in the U.S., of which more than 3 million of whom suffer from chronic migraine headache. Chronic migraine headache is both undertreated and underdiagnosed, and is defined as more than fifteen headache days per month over a three-month period of which more than eight are migrainous, in the absence of medication overuse. According to GIA, the global opportunity for botulinum toxin for the treatment of chronic migraine was estimated to be approximately $600 million in 2017. We are in the process of finalizing our Chronic Migraine Clinical Development strategy. We plan to study DAXI for the treatment of chronic migraine in 2019 or 2020.\nOnabotulinumtoxinA Biosimilar\nIn February 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Mylan, pursuant to which we will collaborate with Mylan exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae. As part of the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a non-refundable upfront payment of $25 million with additional contingent payments of up to $100 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory (i.e. biosimilar biological pathway) milestones and of specified, tiered sales milestones of up to $225 million. In addition, Mylan would pay us low to mid-double digit royalties on any sales of the biosimilar in the U.S., mid-double digit royalties on any sales in Europe, and high single digit royalties on any sales in other ex-U.S. Mylan territories. However, we agreed to waive royalties for U.S. sales, up to a limit of $50 million in annual sales, during the first approximately four years after commercialization to defray launch costs. In February 2019, we and Mylan recently had a Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meeting with the FDA on a proposed biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae. In this meeting, the FDA provided guidance on their expectations for a development program to establish biosimilarity to BOTOX\u00ae. Based on the agency's feedback, we and Mylan believe that a 351(k) pathway for the development of a biosimilar to onabotulinumtoxinA is viable and provides the opportunity to develop and commercialize the first biosimilar product for all eleven currently approved indications of BOTOX\u00ae and BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic.\nDaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical\nDaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical presents several potential advantages, including painless topical administration, no bruising, ease of use and limited dependence on administration technique by physicians and medical staff. We believe these potential advantages may improve the experience of patients undergoing botulinum toxin procedures and could make DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical suitable for multiple indications in the future. We are planning to conduct additional preclinical work for DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical in therapeutic and aesthetic applications where botulinum toxin has shown efficacy and is particularly well suited for injection-free treatments.\nFosun License Agreement\nIn December 2018, we and Fosun entered into the Fosun License Agreement, whereby we have granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize our proprietary DAXI in the Fosun Territory and certain sublicense rights. Additionally, our proprietary peptide excipient technology can be used for molecules other than botulinum toxin. We plan to partner or license the peptide excipient technology opportunistically to monetize our technology platform.\nUnder the Fosun License Agreement, we are eligible to receive a non-refundable upfront payment of $30.0 million within 30 business days of the date of the Fosun License Agreement, which was received in January 2019 net of foreign withholding tax of $3.0 million. We are also eligible to receive (i) additional contingent payments of up to $230.5 million upon the achievement of specified milestones based on (a) the submission and approval of BLAs for certain aesthetic and therapeutic indications and (b) first time calendar year net sales, and (ii) tiered royalty payments in low double digit to high teen percentages on annual net sales. The royalty percentages are subject to reduction in the event that (i) we do not have any valid and unexpired patent claims that cover the product in the Fosun Territory, (ii) biosimilars of the product are sold in the Fosun Territory or (iii) Fosun needs to pay compensation to third parties to either avoid patent infringement or market the product in the Fosun Territory.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nThe following table presents our revenue for the periods indicated and related changes from the prior period:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Milestone\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Relastin Royalty\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,323\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016, primarily due to revenue recognized from the collaboration and license agreement with Mylan.\nIn February 2018, we entered into the Mylan Collaboration, pursuant to which we will collaborate with Mylan exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan) to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae. As part of the Mylan Collaboration, Mylan paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $25 million with additional contingent payments of up to $100 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory (i.e., biosimilar biological pathway) milestones and of specified, tiered sales milestones of up to $225 million. We recognized revenue based on the estimated cost of services incurred over the estimated cost of services to be provided for the development period.\nWe recognized royalty revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 related to the Relastin asset purchase and royalty agreement. In August 2011, we entered into the Relastin asset purchase and royalty agreement to sell the business related to our Relastin product line to PDI. The Relastin asset purchase and royalty agreement provided for a minimum royalty payment of $0.3 million per year, to be paid quarterly for up to 15 years from the execution date. PDI was subsequently acquired by Valeant in July 2014. On April 23, 2015, we received notice from Valeant terminating the asset purchase and royalty agreement effective as of July 23, 2015. We were entitled to the minimum royalty payment until Valeant returned the Relastin\u00ae intellectual property rights to us. In November 2017, we and Valeant entered into an asset transfer agreement to finalize the termination of the asset purchase and royalty agreement and Valeant returned the Relastin\u00ae intellectual property rights to us. We do not have any current plans for future developments of Relastin\u00ae and our primary focus is on the development of DAXI.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is our personnel costs including stock-based compensation. We expect our expenses to increase in the near term as we initiate and complete additional clinical trials and associated programs related to DAXI for the treatment of glabellar lines and indications in muscle movement and other disorders, such as cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, upper limb spasticity, chronic migraine, and our biosimilar product candidate.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Since our inception, we have focused on our clinical development programs and the related research and development. We have been developing DAXI, DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, and our biosimilar product candidate since 2002 and we have typically shared our employees, consultants and infrastructure resources across both programs. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>salaries and related expenses for personnel in research and development functions, including stock-based compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses related to the initiation and completion of clinical trials for DAXI and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, including expenses related to production of clinical supplies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees paid to clinical consultants, CROs and other vendors, including all related fees for investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other consulting fees paid to third parties;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses related to establishment and maintenance of our own manufacturing facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses related to the manufacture of drug substance and drug product supplies for ongoing and future preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-commercial supplies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses to support our product development and establish manufacturing capabilities to support potential future commercialization of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses related to license fees and milestone payments under in-licensing agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements in the U.S., the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>depreciation and other allocated expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our research and development expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties primarily related to the timing and cost needed to complete our respective projects. Further, the development timelines, probability of success and development expenses can differ materially from expectations and the completion of clinical trials may take several years or more depending on the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. Accordingly, the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development. We expect our research and development expenses to maintain or increase as we continue our clinical development of DAXI for the treatment of facial wrinkles and other neuroscience indications, such as cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, adult upper limb spasticity, and chronic migraine, any future new indications, and our biosimilar product candidate or if the FDA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials for approval.\nOur research and development expenses fluctuate as projects transition from one development phase to the next. Depending on the stage of completion and level of effort related to each development phase undertaken, we may reflect variations in our research and development expense. We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. We typically share employees, consultants and infrastructure resources among the programs related to DAXI, our biosimilar product candidate, and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical. We believe that the strict allocation of costs by product candidate would not be meaningful. As such, we generally do not track these costs by product candidate.\nOur research and development expenses are summarized as follows:\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clinical and regulatory\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing and quality efforts\n</td> <td>25,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>7,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other research and development expenses\n</td> <td>11,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical and regulatory\nClinical expenses include personnel costs, and external clinical trial costs for clinical sites, clinical research organizations, central laboratories, data management, contractors and regulatory activities associated with the development of DAXI and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, including clinical trials of DAXI for the improvement of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia and plantar fasciitis. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, clinical and regulatory costs totaled $47.8 million, or 52%, $43.9 million, or 55%, and $15.1 million, or 30% of the total research and development expenses in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nClinical and regulatory costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 9%, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased costs related to hiring additional personnel and outside services to address compliance requirements and infrastructure build-out as well as studies related to cervical dystonia, adult upper limb spasticity, plantar fasciitis, forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, offset by a decrease in clinical trial costs related to glabellar lines as the SAKURA trials wind down. Clinical and regulatory costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 192%, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the ongoing clinical trials for DAXI for the treatment of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia, and plantar fasciitis.\nWe expect to maintain or increase our clinical and regulatory costs in the near term as we initiate and complete clinical trials and other associated programs related to DAXI for the treatment of glabellar lines, forehead lines, lateral canthal lines, cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, adult upper limb spasticity, chronic migraine, and other indications, and our anticipated BLA submission upon the completion and success of the clinical trials for the DAXI glabellar lines indication.\nManufacturing and quality efforts\nManufacturing and quality efforts include personnel and occupancy expenses, external contract manufacturing costs and pre-approval manufacturing of drug product used in research and our development of DAXI. Manufacturing and quality efforts also include raw materials, lab supplies, and storage and shipment of our product to support quality control and assurance activities. These costs do not include clinical costs associated with the development of DAXI.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, costs associated with our manufacturing and quality efforts for both DAXI and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical development totaled $25.9 million, or 28%, $21.5 million, or 27%, and $20.0 million, or 40% of the total research and development expenses in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nManufacturing and quality efforts for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 20%, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased costs related to hiring additional personnel and outside services to address compliance requirements and infrastructure build-out. Manufacturing and quality efforts for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 8%, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to increased costs related to hiring additional personnel as well as an increase in outside services and consulting for compliance requirements. We expect our manufacturing and quality efforts to continue to increase as we approach commercialization.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation for research and development increased by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, and increased by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to increased employee headcount and an average increase in fair value of stock option granted during those periods.\nOther research and development expenses\nOther research and development expenses include expenses for personnel, contract research organizations, consultants, raw materials, and lab supplies used to conduct preclinical research and development of DAXI, our DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, and biosimilar product candidates. Other research and development expenses represented $11.4 million, or 12%, $9.0 million, or 11%, and $9.8 million, or 19% for the years end on December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nOther research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 27%, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased consulting costs on preclinical research and development of DAXI, our DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, and biosimilar product candidates. Other research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by 8%, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a milestone payment of $2.0 million to BTRX to acquire a portfolio of patents.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily the following:\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>personnel and service costs in our finance, information technology, investor relations, legal, human resources, and other administrative functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>professional fees for accounting and legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and litigation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pre-commercial activities including market research, public relations, promotion and advertising,\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect that our general and administrative expenses will maintain or increase with the continued development of, and if approved, the commercialization of DAXI.

General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 33%, compared to the same period in 2016. For both periods presented, the increases are primarily due to i) increased personnel in information technology, accounting, legal, and other administrative functions; ii) cost related to pre-commercial initiatives to support our future product launch following our anticipated BLA submission upon the completion and success of the clinical trials for the DAXI glabellar lines indication, iii) costs related to accounting and legal services, and iv) other costs related to infrastructure build-out.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation for general and administrative expenses increased for the periods presented primarily due to an increase in employee headcount and an average increase in the fair value of stock option granted during those periods.\nLoss on Impairment\nThe following table presents our loss on impairment for the periods indicated and related changes from the prior period:\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on impairment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe constructed a large capacity fill/finish line dedicated to the manufacturing of DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical and to support our regulatory license applications. In June 2016, we discontinued clinical development of DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical for the treatment of crow's feet and axillary hyperhidrosis. As a result, we recorded a loss on impairment of $9.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively, related to our DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical fill/finish line and certain other assets, during the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016. No impairment loss was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet Non-Operating Income and Expense\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our deposit, money market fund, and short-term investment balances. We expect interest income to vary each reporting period depending on our average deposit, money market fund, and short-term investment balances during the period and market interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of the interest charges associated with our financing obligations and capitalized interest. Interest expense includes cash and non-cash components with the non-cash components consisting of effective interest recognized on the financing obligations and interest capitalized for assets constructed for use in operations.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative liability associated with the Medicis settlement\nThe product approval payment associated with the Medicis settlement is classified as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. This liability is remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding gain or loss from the adjustment recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. We will continue to record adjustments to the fair value of the Medicis settlement derivative liability until the product approval payment has been paid. The decrease recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects an increase to the valuation of the derivative liability based on assumptions related to the development of DAXI for glabellar lines.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net is comprised of miscellaneous tax and other expense items.\nThe following table presents our net non-operating income and expense for the periods indicated and related changes from the prior period:\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(457\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of derivative liability associated with the Medicis settlement\n</td> <td>(140\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(591\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(608\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>(773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(525\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(535\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net non-operating income (expenses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(163\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,055\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*NM - not meaningful\nOur total net non-operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $3.2 million, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in interest income from our short-term investments. Our total net non-operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $0.9 million, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the declining principal balance on the Essex Capital Lease offset by an increase in the interest income from a stronger investment portfolio.\nIncome Taxes\nSince inception, we have incurred net losses and have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax and the tax benefits of our operating losses have been fully offset by valuation allowances.\nTax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 is $3.0 million. The tax provision is related to foreign withholding taxes. There was no provision or benefit from income taxes during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act\u201d). The Tax Reform Act includes but is not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, allowing for federal net operating losses ( NOL\u201d) to be carried over indefinitely for NOL generated after December 31, 2017, and creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense.\nIn March 2018, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Reform Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. We completed our assessment of the accounting impact resulting from the Tax Reform Act in December 2018. The impact of the Tax Reform Act includes:\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in deferred tax assets resulting from the change in tax rate in the amount of $62.9 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of net operating loss of $43.5 million as a result of the reversal of the intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual properties, refer below for further information related to this transaction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in net operating loss of $3.8 million related to a research and development credit adjustment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The aggregated impact resulting from the Tax Reform Act to deferred taxes is $68.1 million, which continues to be fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nWe follow the provisions of the FASB's guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions. The guidance indicates a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. No liability related to uncertain tax positions is recorded in the financial statements due to the fact that the liabilities have been netted against deferred attribute carryovers. It is our policy to include penalties and interest related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financial condition is summarized as follows:\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(107,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working Capital\n</td> <td>175,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(88,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stockholders' Equity\n</td> <td>145,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123,223\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe hold our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of non-interest bearing bank accounts and interest-bearing instruments subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in U.S. government and agency securities and money market accounts. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $175.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $282.9 million at December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $107.1 million, which was primarily due to cash used in operations, purchase of property and equipment of $7.0 million, and purchases of short-term investments of $314.9 million. These decreases were primarily offset by the proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $146.0 million and the proceeds from sales of short-term investments of $67.4 million.\nThrough December 31, 2018, we have funded substantially all of our operations through the sale and issuance of our common stock, preferred stock, venture debt, and convertible debt. Due to our substantial research and development expenditures, we have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Our expenditures are primarily related to research and development activities. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we advance DAXI through clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations which we may obtain from additional financings, public offerings, or other sources. As of December 31, 2018, we had available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $175.8 million.\nWe derived the following summary of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K:\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(104,246\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(95,342\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59,827\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(107,026\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,499\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>1,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,642\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by personnel, manufacturing costs, clinical development, and facility related expenditures. The changes in net cash used in operating activities are primarily related to our net loss, working capital fluctuations and changes in our non-cash expenses, all which are highly variable. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by our working capital requirements and the extent to which we increase spending on personnel and research and development activities as our business grows.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $104.2 million was primarily due to clinical spend of approximately $38.5 million to advance our clinical programs toward commercialization; investing in our personnel and talent retention, which represents approximately $31.0 million; and professional services and consulting of approximately $32.0 million, offset by the $25.0 million upfront payment received from the Mylan Collaboration. The remaining balance of operating activities related primarily to rent, utilities, and other supplies.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $95.3 million was primarily due to clinical spend of more than $30 million to advance our clinical programs toward commercialization; investing in our personnel and talent retention, which represents approximately $25 million; and professional services and consulting of approximately $15 million. The remaining balance of operating activities related primarily to rent, utilities, and other supplies.\nNet cash used in operating activities of $59.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 was largely due to ongoing clinical trial activities for our DAXI program and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, including more than $10 million for payments to clinical trial vendors; investing in our personnel, including those that support the clinical programs, and talent retention, which represents more than $20 million; and professional services and consulting of approximately $10 million. The remaining balance of operating activities related primarily to rent, utilities, and other supplies.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by or used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment, proceeds from sale of assets, and fluctuations in the timing of purchases and maturities of short-term investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by or used in financing activities are primarily driven by proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in connection with follow-on offerings (as described below), ATM offerings (as described below), stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases. Decreases in our cash flows from financing activities are primarily due to payments to settle employee tax obligations resulting from net settlement of restricted stock awards.\nFollow-On Public Offerings\nIn December 2017, we completed a follow-on public offering, or the 2017 follow-on offering, pursuant to which we issued 5,389,515 shares of common stock at $31.00 per share, including the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option to purchase 550,806 additional shares of common stock, for net proceeds of $156.9 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses.\nIn January 2019, we completed a follow-on public offering, or the 2019 follow-on offering, pursuant to which we issued 6,764,705 shares of common stock at $17.00 per share, including the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option to purchase 882,352 additional shares of common stock, for net proceeds of $107.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses.\nATM Offering\nIn March 2016, we entered into an At-the-market Issuance Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen\u201d) (the 2016 ATM agreement\u201d). Under the 2016 ATM agreement, we may offer and sell common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $75.0 million from time to time through Cowen as our sales agent. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 1,802,651 shares of common stock under the 2016 ATM Agreement at a weighted average price of $22.17 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $40.0 million, and net proceeds of $38.2 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.\nIn March 2018, we terminated the 2016 ATM Agreement and entered into the 2018 ATM Agreement. Under 2018 ATM Agreement, we may offer and sell common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $125.0 million from time to time through Cantor Fitzgerald as our sales agent. No sales of our common stock have taken place under the 2018 ATM Agreement as of December 31, 2018.\nCommon Stock and Common Stock Equivalents\nAs of February 22, 2019, the number of shares outstanding of our common stock is 44,028,590, which includes restricted stock awards. We had outstanding common stock options of 4,363,688, outstanding common stock warrants of 34,113, unvested restricted stock awards of 843,853, and shares expected to be purchased on June 30, 2019 under the 2014 ESPP of 10,405 as of February 22, 2019.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect to make additional capital outlays to increase operating expenditures over the next several years to support the completion of the clinical trials and other associated programs relating to DAXI for the treatment of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, upper limb spasticity, migraine headache, and other indications, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization. We believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-K. However, we anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional financing in the future to fund our operations. In order to meet these additional cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or issue debt, convertible debt or other securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or convertible debt securities, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to terminate or delay clinical trials or other development activities for DAXI, our biosimilar product candidate and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, and any future product candidates, or delay our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if we obtain marketing approval. We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the results of our clinical trials for DAXI and preclinical trials of DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, biosimilar or any future product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for DAXI, or any future product candidates including DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical or biosimilar;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number and characteristics of any additional product candidates we develop or acquire;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing and conducting preclinical and clinical trials of DAXI, DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, biosimilar or any future product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of commercialization activities if DAXI or any future product candidates including DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical or biosimilar are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of manufacturing DAXI, DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, biosimilar or any future product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize and maintaining our related facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements including the Mylan collaboration, Fosun licensing, and the terms of and timing such arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the degree and rate of market acceptance of any future approved products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the emergence, approval, availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing products or treatments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any litigation, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs associated with being a public company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, future approved products, if any.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.\nSince inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to identifying and developing product candidates for the aesthetic and therapeutic pharmaceutical markets, recruiting personnel, raising capital, conducting preclinical and clinical development of, and manufacturing development for DAXI and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical. We have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have not yet commenced commercial operations, have not generated product revenue to date, and will continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We have recorded net losses of $142.6 million, $120.6 million, and $89.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had a working capital surplus of $176.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $684.8 million. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of common stock, convertible preferred stock, notes payable, and convertible notes. As of December 31, 2018, we had capital resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $175.8 million. In January 2019, we completed the 2019 follow-on offering for net proceeds of $107.6 million after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. In January 2019, we received $27.0 million for an upfront payment net of foreign withholding tax from Fosun. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the next 12 months following the issuance of this Form 10-K, and may identify additional capital resources to fund our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements are described below.\nRevenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), using the full retrospective transition method. We evaluated our prior contractual revenue arrangement with PDI, which was acquired by Valeant in 2014. After Valeant notified us that it intended to terminate the asset purchase and royalty agreement in 2015, we continued to receive royalties of $75,000 each quarter until November 2017 when Valeant and us entered into an asset transfer agreement to finalize the termination of the asset purchase and royalty agreement and Valeant returned the Relastin\u00ae intellectual property rights to us. Based on its evaluation, we determined that the new guidance had no impact to the revenue recognized prior to January 1, 2018 and, accordingly, had no impact on the accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2018.\nWe elected to use certain practical expedients permitted related to adoption (Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3-Revenue\u201d in this Form 10-K.) and the adoption of ASC 606 had no impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfied a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nClinical Trial Accruals\nClinical trial costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred. We accrue for expenses resulting from contracts with clinical research organizations ( CROs\u201d), investigators and consultants, and under certain other agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. In the event advance payments are made to a CRO, the payments will be recorded as a prepaid asset, which will be amortized as services are rendered.\nThe CRO contracts generally include pass-through fees including, but not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs and other miscellaneous costs, including shipping and printing fees. We estimate our clinical accruals based on reports from and discussion with clinical personnel and outside services providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed. We estimate accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Our clinical trial accrual is dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from the CROs and other third-party vendors. As of December 31, 2018, there have not been any material adjustments to our estimated accrued clinical expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees, non-employee consultants, and non-employee directors based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Stock-based compensation expenses are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss based on the functional area to which the related recipients belong.\nThe estimated grant date fair values of the option awards granted to employees and non-employee directors during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected volatility\n</td> <td>60.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend rate\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions that determine the fair value of options. These assumptions are as follows:\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected term - The expected term represents the period that our options are expected to be outstanding and is calculated using the simplified method. We qualify for the simplified method as our stock options have the following characteristics: (i) granted at-the-money; (ii) exercisability is conditioned upon service through the vesting date; (iii) termination of service prior to vesting results in forfeiture; (iv) limited exercise period following termination of service; and (v) options are non-transferable and non-hedgeable, or plain vanilla\u201d options, and we have limited history of exercise data.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected volatility - Beginning on January 1, 2017, the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a group of similar entities combined with the historical volatility of us, whereas prior to 2017, the expected volatility was based solely on the historical volatility of a group of similar entities. In evaluating similarity, we considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, capital structure, and size.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates with terms similar to the option's expected term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dividend rate - The expected dividend was assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As of January 1, 2017, we began accounting for forfeitures as they occur, which was an acceptable change in accordance with ASU 2016-09. In connection with changing the forfeiture rate methodology, we recorded a cumulative charge of less than $0.1 million to the Accumulated Deficit balance as of January 1, 2017.\nAs of July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2018-07 and began accounting for share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees (excluding non-employee directors) using a retroactive approach. Under ASU 2018-07, equity-classified non-employee share-based payment awards are measured at the fair value on the grant date, and expense is recognized in the same period and in the same manner as if we had paid cash for the goods or services received. With the adoption of ASU 2018-07, we recorded a cumulative charge of less than $0.1 million to the Accumulated Deficit balance as of January 1, 2018.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term and expected volatility related to our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may make refinements to the estimates of our expected terms and expected volatility that could materially impact our future stock-based compensation.\nDerivative Liabilities\nWe bifurcated and separately accounted for derivative instruments related to payment provisions underlying the Medicis settlement. This derivative is accounted for as a liability, which will be remeasured to fair value as of each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. We will continue to record adjustments to the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the Medicis settlement until the remaining settlement payment has been paid.\nThe fair value of the product approval payment derivative was determined by estimating the timing and probability of the related approval and multiplying the payment amount by this probability percentage then applying a discount factor. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the product approval payment derivative of $2.6 million was determined by updating the timing and probability estimate of the related approval and applying a discount factor assuming a term of 2.5 years, a risk-free rate of 2.0% and a credit risk adjustment of 6.5%. As of December 31, 2018, we determined the fair value of its liability for the product approval payment was $2.7 million, which was measured by assuming a term of 1.5 years, a risk-free rate of 2.6% and a credit risk adjustment of 8.0%. Our assumption for the expected term is based on an expected BLA approval in 2020. We did not make any payments under the product approval payment during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. As a result of the fair value remeasurements during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recognized aggregate losses of $0.1 million, $0.6 million, and $0.6 million, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment subject to depreciation, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Events and changes in circumstances considered important that could result in an impairment review of long-lived assets include (i) a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; (ii) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition; (iii) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (iv) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; (v) a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; and (vi) a current expectation that, more likely than not (more than 50 percent), a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The impairment evaluation of long-lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives. If the estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the remaining estimated useful lives, we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived assets exceeds the fair value. Fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis.\nWe constructed a fill/finish line for the future commercial manufacturing of our DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical and to support its clinical trials and regulatory license applications. In 2016, following the results of the REALISE 1 Phase 3 clinical trial for crow's feet, we discontinued our DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical clinical development programs for the treatment of crow's feet and for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. We performed an impairment analysis of the DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical fill/finish line and other fixed assets to determine fair value based on highest and best use. We concluded that only certain equipment comprising the DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical fill/finish line would be repurposed for commercial-scale manufacturing of DAXI. As a result, we determined fair value based on its highest and best use and that for certain components of the fill/finish line and other fixed assets, the carrying value of the assets was not entirely recoverable and the fair value, which was calculated using the market or cost approach depending on the specific asset, was lower than the carrying value. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss on impairment of $2.9 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold certain component relating to the fill/finish line manufacturing equipment and recognized a gain of $1.5 million, which is included in Research and Development expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differences in accounting for reporting purposes and tax purposes for certain items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and comprehensive loss become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or when NOL or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions, losses and credits can be utilized.\nWe must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. Based on the available evidence, we are unable, at this time, to support the determination that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be utilized in the future. Accordingly, we recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We intend to maintain valuation allowances until sufficient evidence exists to support its reversal.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had NOL carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, if any, for federal, California, and other states income tax purposes of $638.6 million, $179.1 million, and $703.9 million, respectively. The California NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2010. The federal NOL carryforwards will begin expiring in 2020, and the other states NOL carryforwards will begin expiring in 2030 if they are not utilized. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, the federal NOL generated after December 31, 2017 will carryover indefinitely with statutory limitations to the annual utilization.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had research and development credit carryforwards of $7.3 million and $6.7 million available to reduce future taxable income, if any, for federal and California income tax purposes, respectively.\nThe federal research and development credit carryforwards will begin expiring in 2023 if they are not utilized, and the California research and development credit carryforwards have no expiration date.\nIn general, if we experience a greater than 50 percentage point aggregate change in ownership over a 3-year period (a Section 382 ownership change), utilization of its pre-change NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (California and other states have similar laws). The annual limitation generally is determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of such ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carryforwards before utilization. We determined that an ownership change occurred on April 7, 2004 but that all carryforwards can be utilized prior to the expiration. We also determined that an ownership change occurred in February 2014, and as a result, we reduced the deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance to account for this limitation. Since the research and development credits for California carry over indefinitely, there was no change to the California research and development credits. We reviewed our Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation through December 31, 2018 and have not identified any ownership changes resulting in a limitation.\nOur ability to use our remaining NOL carryforwards may be further limited if we experience a Section 382 ownership change as a result of future changes in its stock ownership.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The following table, which summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, represents material expected or contractually committed future obligations, with terms in excess of one year. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated funding activities and from our existing cash balances.\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>( In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis table does not include any milestone or royalty payments, which may become payable to third parties under agreements, as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known.\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We are obligated to pay milestone and royalties to List Laboratories on future sales of botulinum toxin products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We also have one remaining future milestone payment of $4.0 million due and payable to Valeant upon the achievement of regulatory approval for DAXI or DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In June 2016, we entered into BTRX Purchase Agreement in which we agreed to pay up to an additional $16.0 million in aggregate upon the satisfaction of specified milestones relating to our sales revenue, intellectual property, and clinical and regulatory events.

In accordance with the Althea Services Agreement, we will have minimum purchase obligations based on its production forecasts. As of December 31, 2018, we made non-refundable advanced payments of $1.9 million in accordance with the terms of the Althea Services Agreement. The remaining services are cancellable at any time, with the costs we are required to pay that incurred through the cancellation date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> This table does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal and state income tax matters of $4.2 million at December 31, 2018. The timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at December 31, 2018. We do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or any relationships with any entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in this Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and results of operations of a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing neuromodulators for aesthetic and therapeutic indications. The company's lead drug candidate is DAXI, a highly purified botulinum toxin Type A, which has shown positive results in various clinical trials for treating glabellar lines, cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, adult upper limb spasticity, and chronic migraine. The company also has collaborative agreements for the development and commercialization of a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae and is planning to conduct additional preclinical work for a topical application of botulinum toxin.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on this Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of novel neuromodulators for multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications. We are leveraging our proprietary portfolio of botulinum toxin type A compounds, formulated with our patented and proprietary peptide excipient technology, to address unmet needs in large and growing neuromodular markets. Our initial focus is on developing daxibotulinumtoxinA, our highly purified botulinum toxin Type A, for a broad spectrum of aesthetic and therapeutic indications, including facial wrinkles, muscle disorders, and chronic migraine.\nOur lead drug candidate is DAXI. We used our unique proprietary peptide excipient technology to formulate DAXI. The noncovalent bond formed between the proprietary peptide excipient technology and the botulinum toxin may enable longer residence time of botulinum toxin Type A, which could explain DAXI's long duration of effect. The process binds a highly purified botulinum toxin Type A with a unique proprietary stabilizing excipient peptide. We do not use human serum albumin and other animal-sourced ingredients, which carry the risk of transmission of pathogens, to stabilize our product.\nWe are currently studying DAXI for the treatment of facial wrinkles, cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, adult upper limb spasticity and chronic migraine. We believe DAXI has the potential to expand into additional aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the future. We also are developing a topically applied neuromodulator for aesthetic and therapeutic indications, DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, and have a collaboration and license agreement with Mylan to develop and commercialize a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae.\nDAXI\nWe are developing an injectable formulation of botulinum toxin type A, which we refer to as DAXI, for indications where a long-lasting effect is desired. We believe, and our preclinical and clinical studies using DAXI indicate, that daxibotulinumtoxinA combined with our novel peptide may safely achieve enhanced clinical efficacy and duration without an increase in associated adverse events. We are currently focusing on developing DAXI for the treatment of both aesthetic and therapeutic indications.\nGlabellar Lines\nThe glabella is the area between the eyebrows and above the nose. Glabellar lines, often called frown lines,\u201d are vertical lines that develop between the eyebrows and may appear as a single vertical line or as two or more lines. When one frowns, the muscles of the glabella contract causing vertical creases to form between the eyebrows. Botulinum toxin is used to temporarily block the ability of nerves to trigger contraction of injected muscle, inhibiting movement of the muscles that cause the frown lines, giving the skin a smoother, more refreshed appearance.\nIn 2015, we reported results from BELMONT, a Phase 2 active comparator, placebo-controlled clinical trial for the treatment of glabellar lines against BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic. The 24-week data showed that DAXI achieved its primary efficacy measurement for all doses of DAXI, and that such efficacy was highly statistically significant as compared to placebo. In addition, the 40 Unit dose of DAXI demonstrated a 23.6-week median duration versus BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic with an 18.8-week median duration. Across all cohorts, DAXI appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated.\nThe Phase 3 clinical program includes a) SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2, two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single administration of DAXI for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults and b) SAKURA 3, a long-term, open-label safety trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety of DAXI for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults following both single and repeat treatment administration. In December 2017, we announced top-line results for the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials. Both SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 met the primary composite endpoint by delivering highly statistically significant improvement against placebo in reducing the severity of glabellar lines. The percentage of DAXI-treated patients who had none or mild wrinkles and achieved at least a two-point improvement from baseline on both validated physician and patient assessments was 73.6 percent in SAKURA 1 and 74.0 percent in SAKURA 2 compared to placebo (p<0.0001) at Week 4. Also, at that time point, 88 percent of DAXI-treated patients in SAKURA 1 and 91 percent of DAXI patients in SAKURA 2 said they were very satisfied or satisfied with their treatment experience.\nThere were several secondary endpoints used to evaluate duration of effect, including the proportion of patients achieving none or mild response on IGA-FWS compared to placebo, median duration for time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS, and median duration for time to return to baseline on both IGA-FWS and PFWS. The percentage of DAXI-treated patients who achieved a none or mild response on IGA-FWS was 35.3 percent in SAKURA 1 and 29.4 percent at SAKURA 2 compared to placebo (p<0.0001) at Week 24. The median duration for time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS for DAXI-treated patients was 24.0 weeks for SAKURA 1 and 23.9 weeks for SAKURA 2. The median duration for time to return to baseline wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS for DAXI-treated patients was 27.7 weeks for SAKURA 1 and 26.0 weeks for SAKURA 2. For comparison, an additional exploratory duration endpoint was evaluated, which mirrors the duration measure used in the BELMONT Phase 2 study. This endpoint, was the median duration of greater or equal to 1 point improvement from baseline on IGA-FWS for DAXI-treated patients, and the results were 24.1 weeks for both SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2, and 23.6 weeks for BELMONT.\nIn December 2018, we announced top-line results for the SAKURA 3 open-label, long-term safety study. DAXI appeared to be generally well-tolerated, with no new tolerability or safety concerns reported. As was seen in the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials, adverse events were mild, localized and transient. The rate of treatment-related adverse events decreased over successive treatments. The most common treatment-related adverse events per treatment of DAXI were headache (3.3 percent of treatments), injection site pain (2.7 percent), injection site erythema (2.5 percent), and injection site oedema (2.2 percent). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Eyelid ptosis was reported in 0.9 percent of treatments, decreased in frequency with successive treatments and was substantially lower than the rate observed in SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 (2.2 percent of treatments). The majority of ptosis events were characterized as mild in severity (85 percent) and transient. A high degree of efficacy was seen consistently across all three treatment cycles. Results were consistent with SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 based on the IGA-FWS and PFWS scales. As early as Week 1, over 90 percent of subjects across all three treatments had none or mild wrinkles on the IGA-FWS. At Week 4, the percentage of DAXI-treated patients who achieved a none or mild response on IGA-FWS was 95.8 percent, 96.6 percent, and 97.7 percent for first, second and third treatment for SAKURA 3, respectively, and 97.5 percent for SAKURA 2 and SAKURA 1. On the more stringent 2-point composite endpoint, which was the primary efficacy endpoint in SAKURA 1 and 2, efficacy improved with successive treatment cycles: 73.2 percent, 77.7 percent, and 79.6 percent for first, second and third treatment of SAKURA 3, respectively, and 73.6 percent and 74.0 percent for SAKURA 1 and 2, respectively.\nAs in the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials, there were several secondary endpoints used to evaluate duration of effect, including median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS, and median duration for time to return to baseline wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS. Duration was evaluated in the first two 36-week treatment cycles; the third treatment cycle was not evaluated for duration as the observation period ended at twelve weeks for the purpose of this study. Median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS is 28.0 weeks and 28.1 weeks for first and second treatment of SAKURA 3, respectively, 27.7 weeks for SAKURA 1, and 26.0 weeks for SAKURA 2. Median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS is 24.0 weeks and 24.1 weeks for first and second treatment of SAKURA 3, respectively, 24.0 weeks for SAKURA 1, and 23.9 weeks for SAKURA 2. We held a pre-BLA meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) in December 2018, to agree upon the content and format of the BLA, which we plan to submit in first half of 2019. We plan to file marketing applications in the European Union, Canada, and certain Latin American and Asian countries after filing in the U.S.\nWe held a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA in December 2018, to agree upon the content and format of the BLA, which we plan to submit in first half of 2019.\nForehead Lines\nForehead lines are produced by the action of the frontalis muscle, a large, thin, vertically-oriented muscle which lifts the eyebrows. The frontalis muscle serves as an antagonist to the glabellar musculature, a natural depressor that is responsible for frowning and associated eyebrow movement. As the eyebrow is considered the aesthetic center of the upper face, forehead lines can significantly impact the aesthetic appearance of the face, contribute to increased signs of aging and convey unwanted social signals. However, both men and women have identified internal factors, such as wanting to look good for their age or having a more youthful appearance as very important and have prioritized forehead lines as bothersome areas for potential treatment regardless of age or available income. We initiated a Phase 2 study in forehead lines in January 2019.\nLateral Canthal Lines\nLCL, or \"crow's feet,\" are the spider-like fine lines around the outside corners of the eyes that become more obvious when someone smiles. These lines (also referred to as periorbital wrinkles, laugh lines or smile lines), fan out across the skin from the outer corner of each eye. Sometimes they extend down across the cheekbones to the lower cheeks. Repetitive motions, such as squinting and smiling, can lead to the increase of wrinkles and contribute to the severity and onset of crow's feet. Age and exposure to sun also play significant roles in development of these lines, which can deepen over time. Current treatments include anti-wrinkle eye creams and moisturizers, topical tretinoins, botulinum toxin injections, dermal fillers and laser treatments. BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic was approved to treat LCL in 2013, and is currently the only toxin approved for that use, though other toxins are used off-label. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in LCL in the first quarter of 2019.\nCervical Dystonia\nWe have been developing DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia, a muscle movement disorder. Muscle movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect a person's ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. In 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 dose-escalating, open-label clinical study of DAXI to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and duration of effect of DAXI in subjects with moderate to severe isolated cervical dystonia.\nIn May 2017, we announced positive 24 week topline results in all three cohorts from the Phase 2 trial. The topline data demonstrated a median duration of at least 24 weeks for each of the three cohorts. The topline data also displayed a clinically significant impact on cervical dystonia signs and symptoms. At Week 4, DAXI showed a clinically significant mean reduction of 38% from baseline across all three cohorts. This reduction continued to increase to 50% at Week 6 for all subjects, was 42% at Week 12 and was maintained at or above 30% through Week 24. The topline data also showed that DAXI appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated through Week 24 in all three cohorts. There were no serious adverse events and no dose-dependent increase in adverse events. The treatment-related adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate in severity, with one case of neck pain reported as severe. The most common adverse events were dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing (14 percent), of which all cases were mild in severity, injection site redness (8 percent), injection site bruising (5 percent), injection site pain (5 percent), muscle tightness (5 percent) and muscle weakness (5 percent).\nIn November 2017, the FDA granted orphan drug status to DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia in adults. Additionally, in November 2017, we completed our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and received scientific advice from the EMA regarding DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia.\nIn June 2018, we announced the initiation of patient dosing in our ASPEN Phase 3 clinical program based on the Phase 2 safety and efficacy results and guidance from the FDA and EMA. The ASPEN Phase 3 clinical program consists of two trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia in adults including: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial, and an open-label, long-term safety trial. The program is expected to enroll approximately 300 patients in the pivotal trial and 350 patients in the open-label trial at multiple sites in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The program is expected to complete enrollment by early 2020, and we expect to release topline results in the second half of 2020.\nPlantar Fasciitis\nIn 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of DAXI in the therapeutic indication of plantar fasciitis. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single administration of DAXI in reducing the signs and symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The study completed enrollment of 59 subjects in the U.S. in October 2017. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is the improvement in the AOFAS.\nIn January 2018, we announced the interim 8-week Phase 2a results for the plantar fasciitis trial. The trial's primary endpoint, the reduction in the patient-reported VAS for pain at Week 8, showed a robust impact on pain, with a greater than 50 percent reduction for patients treated with DAXI. In the intent-to-treat population, a mean reduction in the VAS score of 54.2 percent from baseline was achieved with DAXI, compared with a 42.6 percent reduction in the placebo group, which upon further subgroup analysis, was driven primarily by a strong placebo response in the control group at three of the five study sites. While the results are not statistically significant (p=0.39), DAXI provided patients with considerable pain relief. Similar numeric trends were seen in the secondary and exploratory endpoints. DAXI appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated through Week 8. The majority of adverse events in both treatment groups were mild in severity. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. The most common treatment-related adverse events for DAXI and placebo were injection site pain (10.0 percent and 10.3 percent) and muscle weakness (3.3 percent and 3.4 percent), both respectively, all of which were classified as mild in severity We completed the 16-week trial which showed a 58 percent reduction of pain from baseline along with a strong placebo response, with the difference between the treatment groups not being statistically significant.\nIn September 2018, we completed a Type C meeting with FDA discussing the design of the Phase 2 dose-finding study. We initiated another Phase 2 trial in December 2018. The Phase 2 prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of administration of our investigational drug candidate DAXI in reducing the signs and symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The study is expected to enroll approximately 150 adult patients with unilateral plantar fasciitis, from approximately 20 study centers in the U.S.. Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive an injection of a low dose, high dose or placebo. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in NPRS score at Week 8. Patients will be followed for up to 24 weeks post treatment to assess treatment response, tolerability and safety. We expect to complete enrollment in this Phase 2 trial during the second half of 2019 and release topline results in the second half of 2020.\nAdult Upper Limb Spasticity\nAdult upper limb spasticity is a chronic movement disorder (an inability to produce and control bodily movements), that presents as increased tone or stiffness of the muscles. Spasticity results from neurological insults (e.g., stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury) to the brain that control voluntary movement of the body, arms and legs. According to GIA, the global opportunity for botulinum toxin for the treatment of muscle movement disorders, which includes cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity, was estimated to be over $1.0 billion in 2017. We initiated a Phase 2b study (JUNIPER) in adult upper limb spasticity in December 2018, and we expect to release topline results in the second half of 2020.\nChronic Migraine\nMigraine headache is a central nervous system disorder characterized as moderate to severe headache and often includes other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Migraine headache affects more than 38 million people in the U.S., of which more than 3 million of whom suffer from chronic migraine headache. Chronic migraine headache is both undertreated and underdiagnosed, and is defined as more than fifteen headache days per month over a three-month period of which more than eight are migrainous, in the absence of medication overuse. According to GIA, the global opportunity for botulinum toxin for the treatment of chronic migraine was estimated to be approximately $600 million in 2017. We are in the process of finalizing our Chronic Migraine Clinical Development strategy. We plan to study DAXI for the treatment of chronic migraine in 2019 or 2020.\nOnabotulinumtoxinA Biosimilar\nIn February 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Mylan, pursuant to which we will collaborate with Mylan exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae. As part of the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a non-refundable upfront payment of $25 million with additional contingent payments of up to $100 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory (i.e. biosimilar biological pathway) milestones and of specified, tiered sales milestones of up to $225 million. In addition, Mylan would pay us low to mid-double digit royalties on any sales of the biosimilar in the U.S., mid-double digit royalties on any sales in Europe, and high single digit royalties on any sales in other ex-U.S. Mylan territories. However, we agreed to waive royalties for U.S. sales, up to a limit of $50 million in annual sales, during the first approximately four years after commercialization to defray launch costs. In February 2019, we and Mylan recently had a Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meeting with the FDA on a proposed biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae. In this meeting, the FDA provided guidance on their expectations for a development program to establish biosimilarity to BOTOX\u00ae. Based on the agency's feedback, we and Mylan believe that a 351(k) pathway for the development of a biosimilar to onabotulinumtoxinA is viable and provides the opportunity to develop and commercialize the first biosimilar product for all eleven currently approved indications of BOTOX\u00ae and BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic.\nDaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical\nDaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical presents several potential advantages, including painless topical administration, no bruising, ease of use and limited dependence on administration technique by physicians and medical staff. We believe these potential advantages may improve the experience of patients undergoing botulinum toxin procedures and could make DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical suitable for multiple indications in the future. We are planning to conduct additional preclinical work for DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical in therapeutic and aesthetic applications where botulinum toxin has shown efficacy and is particularly well suited for injection-free treatments.\nFosun License Agreement\nIn December 2018, we and Fosun entered into the Fosun License Agreement, whereby we have granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize our proprietary DAXI in the Fosun Territory and certain sublicense rights. Additionally, our proprietary peptide excipient technology can be used for molecules other than botulinum toxin. We plan to partner or license the peptide excipient technology opportunistically to monetize our technology platform.\nUnder the Fosun License Agreement, we are eligible to receive a non-refundable upfront payment of $30.0 million within 30 business days of the date of the Fosun License Agreement, which was received in January 2019 net of foreign withholding tax of $3.0 million. We are also eligible to receive (i) additional contingent payments of up to $230.5 million upon the achievement of specified milestones based on (a) the submission and approval of BLAs for certain aesthetic and therapeutic indications and (b) first time calendar year net sales, and (ii) tiered royalty payments in low double digit to high teen percentages on annual net sales. The royalty percentages are subject to reduction in the event that (i) we do not have any valid and unexpired patent claims that cover the product in the Fosun Territory, (ii) biosimilars of the product are sold in the Fosun Territory or (iii) Fosun needs to pay compensation to third parties to either avoid patent infringement or market the product in the Fosun Territory.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nThe following table presents our revenue for the periods indicated and related changes from the prior period:\n\nOur total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016, primarily due to revenue recognized from the collaboration and license agreement with Mylan.\nIn February 2018, we entered into the Mylan Collaboration, pursuant to which we will collaborate with Mylan exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan) to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae. As part of the Mylan Collaboration, Mylan paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $25 million with additional contingent payments of up to $100 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory (i.e., biosimilar biological pathway) milestones and of specified, tiered sales milestones of up to $225 million. We recognized revenue based on the estimated cost of services incurred over the estimated cost of services to be provided for the development period.\nWe recognized royalty revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 related to the Relastin asset purchase and royalty agreement. In August 2011, we entered into the Relastin asset purchase and royalty agreement to sell the business related to our Relastin product line to PDI. The Relastin asset purchase and royalty agreement provided for a minimum royalty payment of $0.3 million per year, to be paid quarterly for up to 15 years from the execution date. PDI was subsequently acquired by Valeant in July 2014. On April 23, 2015, we received notice from Valeant terminating the asset purchase and royalty agreement effective as of July 23, 2015. We were entitled to the minimum royalty payment until Valeant returned the Relastin\u00ae intellectual property rights to us. In November 2017, we and Valeant entered into an asset transfer agreement to finalize the termination of the asset purchase and royalty agreement and Valeant returned the Relastin\u00ae intellectual property rights to us. We do not have any current plans for future developments of Relastin\u00ae and our primary focus is on the development of DAXI.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is our personnel costs including stock-based compensation. We expect our expenses to increase in the near term as we initiate and complete additional clinical trials and associated programs related to DAXI for the treatment of glabellar lines and indications in muscle movement and other disorders, such as cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, upper limb spasticity, chronic migraine, and our biosimilar product candidate.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Since our inception, we have focused on our clinical development programs and the related research and development. We have been developing DAXI, DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, and our biosimilar product candidate since 2002 and we have typically shared our employees, consultants and infrastructure resources across both programs. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:\n \u2022 salaries and related expenses for personnel in research and development functions, including stock-based compensation; \n \u2022 expenses related to the initiation and completion of clinical trials for DAXI and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, including expenses related to production of clinical supplies; \n \u2022 fees paid to clinical consultants, CROs and other vendors, including all related fees for investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis; \n \u2022 other consulting fees paid to third parties; \n \u2022 expenses related to establishment and maintenance of our own manufacturing facilities; \n \u2022 expenses related to the manufacture of drug substance and drug product supplies for ongoing and future preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-commercial supplies; \n \u2022 expenses to support our product development and establish manufacturing capabilities to support potential future commercialization of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \n \u2022 expenses related to license fees and milestone payments under in-licensing agreements; \n \u2022 expenses related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements in the U.S., the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions; and \n \u2022 depreciation and other allocated expenses.  Our research and development expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties primarily related to the timing and cost needed to complete our respective projects. Further, the development timelines, probability of success and development expenses can differ materially from expectations and the completion of clinical trials may take several years or more depending on the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. Accordingly, the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development. We expect our research and development expenses to maintain or increase as we continue our clinical development of DAXI for the treatment of facial wrinkles and other neuroscience indications, such as cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, adult upper limb spasticity, and chronic migraine, any future new indications, and our biosimilar product candidate or if the FDA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials for approval.\nOur research and development expenses fluctuate as projects transition from one development phase to the next. Depending on the stage of completion and level of effort related to each development phase undertaken, we may reflect variations in our research and development expense. We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. We typically share employees, consultants and infrastructure resources among the programs related to DAXI, our biosimilar product candidate, and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical. We believe that the strict allocation of costs by product candidate would not be meaningful. As such, we generally do not track these costs by product candidate.\nOur research and development expenses are summarized as follows:\n\nClinical and regulatory\nClinical expenses include personnel costs, and external clinical trial costs for clinical sites, clinical research organizations, central laboratories, data management, contractors and regulatory activities associated with the development of DAXI and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, including clinical trials of DAXI for the improvement of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia and plantar fasciitis. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, clinical and regulatory costs totaled $47.8 million, or 52%, $43.9 million, or 55%, and $15.1 million, or 30% of the total research and development expenses in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nClinical and regulatory costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 9%, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased costs related to hiring additional personnel and outside services to address compliance requirements and infrastructure build-out as well as studies related to cervical dystonia, adult upper limb spasticity, plantar fasciitis, forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, offset by a decrease in clinical trial costs", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on this Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of novel neuromodulators for multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications. We are leveraging our proprietary portfolio of botulinum toxin type A compounds, formulated with our patented and proprietary peptide excipient technology, to address unmet needs in large and growing neuromodular markets. Our initial focus is on developing daxibotulinumtoxinA, our highly purified botulinum toxin Type A, for a broad spectrum of aesthetic and therapeutic indications, including facial wrinkles, muscle disorders, and chronic migraine.\nOur lead drug candidate is DAXI. We used our unique proprietary peptide excipient technology to formulate DAXI. The noncovalent bond formed between the proprietary peptide excipient technology and the botulinum toxin may enable longer residence time of botulinum toxin Type A, which could explain DAXI's long duration of effect. The process binds a highly purified botulinum toxin Type A with a unique proprietary stabilizing excipient peptide. We do not use human serum albumin and other animal-sourced ingredients, which carry the risk of transmission of pathogens, to stabilize our product.\nWe are currently studying DAXI for the treatment of facial wrinkles, cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, adult upper limb spasticity and chronic migraine. We believe DAXI has the potential to expand into additional aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the future. We also are developing a topically applied neuromodulator for aesthetic and therapeutic indications, DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, and have a collaboration and license agreement with Mylan to develop and commercialize a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae.\nDAXI\nWe are developing an injectable formulation of botulinum toxin type A, which we refer to as DAXI, for indications where a long-lasting effect is desired. We believe, and our preclinical and clinical studies using DAXI indicate, that daxibotulinumtoxinA combined with our novel peptide may safely achieve enhanced clinical efficacy and duration without an increase in associated adverse events. We are currently focusing on developing DAXI for the treatment of both aesthetic and therapeutic indications.\nGlabellar Lines\nThe glabella is the area between the eyebrows and above the nose. Glabellar lines, often called frown lines,\u201d are vertical lines that develop between the eyebrows and may appear as a single vertical line or as two or more lines. When one frowns, the muscles of the glabella contract causing vertical creases to form between the eyebrows. Botulinum toxin is used to temporarily block the ability of nerves to trigger contraction of injected muscle, inhibiting movement of the muscles that cause the frown lines, giving the skin a smoother, more refreshed appearance.\nIn 2015, we reported results from BELMONT, a Phase 2 active comparator, placebo-controlled clinical trial for the treatment of glabellar lines against BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic. The 24-week data showed that DAXI achieved its primary efficacy measurement for all doses of DAXI, and that such efficacy was highly statistically significant as compared to placebo. In addition, the 40 Unit dose of DAXI demonstrated a 23.6-week median duration versus BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic with an 18.8-week median duration. Across all cohorts, DAXI appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated.\nThe Phase 3 clinical program includes a) SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2, two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single administration of DAXI for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults and b) SAKURA 3, a long-term, open-label safety trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety of DAXI for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults following both single and repeat treatment administration. In December 2017, we announced top-line results for the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials. Both SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 met the primary composite endpoint by delivering highly statistically significant improvement against placebo in reducing the severity of glabellar lines. The percentage of DAXI-treated patients who had none or mild wrinkles and achieved at least a two-point improvement from baseline on both validated physician and patient assessments was 73.6 percent in SAKURA 1 and 74.0 percent in SAKURA 2 compared to placebo (p<0.0001) at Week 4. Also, at that time point, 88 percent of DAXI-treated patients in SAKURA 1 and 91 percent of DAXI patients in SAKURA 2 said they were very satisfied or satisfied with their treatment experience.\nThere were several secondary endpoints used to evaluate duration of effect, including the proportion of patients achieving none or mild response on IGA-FWS compared to placebo, median duration for time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS, and median duration for time to return to baseline on both IGA-FWS and PFWS. The percentage of DAXI-treated patients who achieved a none or mild response on IGA-FWS was 35.3 percent in SAKURA 1 and 29.4 percent at SAKURA 2 compared to placebo (p<0.0001) at Week 24. The median duration for time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS for DAXI-treated patients was 24.0 weeks for SAKURA 1 and 23.9 weeks for SAKURA 2. The median duration for time to return to baseline wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS for DAXI-treated patients was 27.7 weeks for SAKURA 1 and 26.0 weeks for SAKURA 2. For comparison, an additional exploratory duration endpoint was evaluated, which mirrors the duration measure used in the BELMONT Phase 2 study. This endpoint, was the median duration of greater or equal to 1 point improvement from baseline on IGA-FWS for DAXI-treated patients, and the results were 24.1 weeks for both SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2, and 23.6 weeks for BELMONT.\nIn December 2018, we announced top-line results for the SAKURA 3 open-label, long-term safety study. DAXI appeared to be generally well-tolerated, with no new tolerability or safety concerns reported. As was seen in the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials, adverse events were mild, localized and transient. The rate of treatment-related adverse events decreased over successive treatments. The most common treatment-related adverse events per treatment of DAXI were headache (3.3 percent of treatments), injection site pain (2.7 percent), injection site erythema (2.5 percent), and injection site oedema (2.2 percent). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Eyelid ptosis was reported in 0.9 percent of treatments, decreased in frequency with successive treatments and was substantially lower than the rate observed in SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 (2.2 percent of treatments). The majority of ptosis events were characterized as mild in severity (85 percent) and transient. A high degree of efficacy was seen consistently across all three treatment cycles. Results were consistent with SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 based on the IGA-FWS and PFWS scales. As early as Week 1, over 90 percent of subjects across all three treatments had none or mild wrinkles on the IGA-FWS. At Week 4, the percentage of DAXI-treated patients who achieved a none or mild response on IGA-FWS was 95.8 percent, 96.6 percent, and 97.7 percent for first, second and third treatment for SAKURA 3, respectively, and 97.5 percent for SAKURA 2 and SAKURA 1. On the more stringent 2-point composite endpoint, which was the primary efficacy endpoint in SAKURA 1 and 2, efficacy improved with successive treatment cycles: 73.2 percent, 77.7 percent, and 79.6 percent for first, second and third treatment of SAKURA 3, respectively, and 73.6 percent and 74.0 percent for SAKURA 1 and 2, respectively.\nAs in the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials, there were several secondary endpoints used to evaluate duration of effect, including median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS, and median duration for time to return to baseline wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS. Duration was evaluated in the first two 36-week treatment cycles; the third treatment cycle was not evaluated for duration as the observation period ended at twelve weeks for the purpose of this study. Median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS is 28.0 weeks and 28.1 weeks for first and second treatment of SAKURA 3, respectively, 27.7 weeks for SAKURA 1, and 26.0 weeks for SAKURA 2. Median time to loss of none or mild wrinkle severity on both IGA-FWS and PFWS is 24.0 weeks and 24.1 weeks for first and second treatment of SAKURA 3, respectively, 24.0 weeks for SAKURA 1, and 23.9 weeks for SAKURA 2. We held a pre-BLA meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) in December 2018, to agree upon the content and format of the BLA, which we plan to submit in first half of 2019. We plan to file marketing applications in the European Union, Canada, and certain Latin American and Asian countries after filing in the U.S.\nWe held a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA in December 2018, to agree upon the content and format of the BLA, which we plan to submit in first half of 2019.\nForehead Lines\nForehead lines are produced by the action of the frontalis muscle, a large, thin, vertically-oriented muscle which lifts the eyebrows. The frontalis muscle serves as an antagonist to the glabellar musculature, a natural depressor that is responsible for frowning and associated eyebrow movement. As the eyebrow is considered the aesthetic center of the upper face, forehead lines can significantly impact the aesthetic appearance of the face, contribute to increased signs of aging and convey unwanted social signals. However, both men and women have identified internal factors, such as wanting to look good for their age or having a more youthful appearance as very important and have prioritized forehead lines as bothersome areas for potential treatment regardless of age or available income. We initiated a Phase 2 study in forehead lines in January 2019.\nLateral Canthal Lines\nLCL, or \"crow's feet,\" are the spider-like fine lines around the outside corners of the eyes that become more obvious when someone smiles. These lines (also referred to as periorbital wrinkles, laugh lines or smile lines), fan out across the skin from the outer corner of each eye. Sometimes they extend down across the cheekbones to the lower cheeks. Repetitive motions, such as squinting and smiling, can lead to the increase of wrinkles and contribute to the severity and onset of crow's feet. Age and exposure to sun also play significant roles in development of these lines, which can deepen over time. Current treatments include anti-wrinkle eye creams and moisturizers, topical tretinoins, botulinum toxin injections, dermal fillers and laser treatments. BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic was approved to treat LCL in 2013, and is currently the only toxin approved for that use, though other toxins are used off-label. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in LCL in the first quarter of 2019.\nCervical Dystonia\nWe have been developing DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia, a muscle movement disorder. Muscle movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect a person's ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. In 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 dose-escalating, open-label clinical study of DAXI to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and duration of effect of DAXI in subjects with moderate to severe isolated cervical dystonia.\nIn May 2017, we announced positive 24 week topline results in all three cohorts from the Phase 2 trial. The topline data demonstrated a median duration of at least 24 weeks for each of the three cohorts. The topline data also displayed a clinically significant impact on cervical dystonia signs and symptoms. At Week 4, DAXI showed a clinically significant mean reduction of 38% from baseline across all three cohorts. This reduction continued to increase to 50% at Week 6 for all subjects, was 42% at Week 12 and was maintained at or above 30% through Week 24. The topline data also showed that DAXI appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated through Week 24 in all three cohorts. There were no serious adverse events and no dose-dependent increase in adverse events. The treatment-related adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate in severity, with one case of neck pain reported as severe. The most common adverse events were dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing (14 percent), of which all cases were mild in severity, injection site redness (8 percent), injection site bruising (5 percent), injection site pain (5 percent), muscle tightness (5 percent) and muscle weakness (5 percent).\nIn November 2017, the FDA granted orphan drug status to DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia in adults. Additionally, in November 2017, we completed our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and received scientific advice from the EMA regarding DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia.\nIn June 2018, we announced the initiation of patient dosing in our ASPEN Phase 3 clinical program based on the Phase 2 safety and efficacy results and guidance from the FDA and EMA. The ASPEN Phase 3 clinical program consists of two trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DAXI for the treatment of cervical dystonia in adults including: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial, and an open-label, long-term safety trial. The program is expected to enroll approximately 300 patients in the pivotal trial and 350 patients in the open-label trial at multiple sites in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The program is expected to complete enrollment by early 2020, and we expect to release topline results in the second half of 2020.\nPlantar Fasciitis\nIn 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of DAXI in the therapeutic indication of plantar fasciitis. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single administration of DAXI in reducing the signs and symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The study completed enrollment of 59 subjects in the U.S. in October 2017. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is the improvement in the AOFAS.\nIn January 2018, we announced the interim 8-week Phase 2a results for the plantar fasciitis trial. The trial's primary endpoint, the reduction in the patient-reported VAS for pain at Week 8, showed a robust impact on pain, with a greater than 50 percent reduction for patients treated with DAXI. In the intent-to-treat population, a mean reduction in the VAS score of 54.2 percent from baseline was achieved with DAXI, compared with a 42.6 percent reduction in the placebo group, which upon further subgroup analysis, was driven primarily by a strong placebo response in the control group at three of the five study sites. While the results are not statistically significant (p=0.39), DAXI provided patients with considerable pain relief. Similar numeric trends were seen in the secondary and exploratory endpoints. DAXI appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated through Week 8. The majority of adverse events in both treatment groups were mild in severity. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. The most common treatment-related adverse events for DAXI and placebo were injection site pain (10.0 percent and 10.3 percent) and muscle weakness (3.3 percent and 3.4 percent), both respectively, all of which were classified as mild in severity We completed the 16-week trial which showed a 58 percent reduction of pain from baseline along with a strong placebo response, with the difference between the treatment groups not being statistically significant.\nIn September 2018, we completed a Type C meeting with FDA discussing the design of the Phase 2 dose-finding study. We initiated another Phase 2 trial in December 2018. The Phase 2 prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of administration of our investigational drug candidate DAXI in reducing the signs and symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The study is expected to enroll approximately 150 adult patients with unilateral plantar fasciitis, from approximately 20 study centers in the U.S.. Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive an injection of a low dose, high dose or placebo. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in NPRS score at Week 8. Patients will be followed for up to 24 weeks post treatment to assess treatment response, tolerability and safety. We expect to complete enrollment in this Phase 2 trial during the second half of 2019 and release topline results in the second half of 2020.\nAdult Upper Limb Spasticity\nAdult upper limb spasticity is a chronic movement disorder (an inability to produce and control bodily movements), that presents as increased tone or stiffness of the muscles. Spasticity results from neurological insults (e.g., stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury) to the brain that control voluntary movement of the body, arms and legs. According to GIA, the global opportunity for botulinum toxin for the treatment of muscle movement disorders, which includes cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity, was estimated to be over $1.0 billion in 2017. We initiated a Phase 2b study (JUNIPER) in adult upper limb spasticity in December 2018, and we expect to release topline results in the second half of 2020.\nChronic Migraine\nMigraine headache is a central nervous system disorder characterized as moderate to severe headache and often includes other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Migraine headache affects more than 38 million people in the U.S., of which more than 3 million of whom suffer from chronic migraine headache. Chronic migraine headache is both undertreated and underdiagnosed, and is defined as more than fifteen headache days per month over a three-month period of which more than eight are migrainous, in the absence of medication overuse. According to GIA, the global opportunity for botulinum toxin for the treatment of chronic migraine was estimated to be approximately $600 million in 2017. We are in the process of finalizing our Chronic Migraine Clinical Development strategy. We plan to study DAXI for the treatment of chronic migraine in 2019 or 2020.\nOnabotulinumtoxinA Biosimilar\nIn February 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Mylan, pursuant to which we will collaborate with Mylan exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae. As part of the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a non-refundable upfront payment of $25 million with additional contingent payments of up to $100 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory (i.e. biosimilar biological pathway) milestones and of specified, tiered sales milestones of up to $225 million. In addition, Mylan would pay us low to mid-double digit royalties on any sales of the biosimilar in the U.S., mid-double digit royalties on any sales in Europe, and high single digit royalties on any sales in other ex-U.S. Mylan territories. However, we agreed to waive royalties for U.S. sales, up to a limit of $50 million in annual sales, during the first approximately four years after commercialization to defray launch costs. In February 2019, we and Mylan recently had a Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meeting with the FDA on a proposed biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae. In this meeting, the FDA provided guidance on their expectations for a development program to establish biosimilarity to BOTOX\u00ae. Based on the agency's feedback, we and Mylan believe that a 351(k) pathway for the development of a biosimilar to onabotulinumtoxinA is viable and provides the opportunity to develop and commercialize the first biosimilar product for all eleven currently approved indications of BOTOX\u00ae and BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic.\nDaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical\nDaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical presents several potential advantages, including painless topical administration, no bruising, ease of use and limited dependence on administration technique by physicians and medical staff. We believe these potential advantages may improve the experience of patients undergoing botulinum toxin procedures and could make DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical suitable for multiple indications in the future. We are planning to conduct additional preclinical work for DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical in therapeutic and aesthetic applications where botulinum toxin has shown efficacy and is particularly well suited for injection-free treatments.\nFosun License Agreement\nIn December 2018, we and Fosun entered into the Fosun License Agreement, whereby we have granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize our proprietary DAXI in the Fosun Territory and certain sublicense rights. Additionally, our proprietary peptide excipient technology can be used for molecules other than botulinum toxin. We plan to partner or license the peptide excipient technology opportunistically to monetize our technology platform.\nUnder the Fosun License Agreement, we are eligible to receive a non-refundable upfront payment of $30.0 million within 30 business days of the date of the Fosun License Agreement, which was received in January 2019 net of foreign withholding tax of $3.0 million. We are also eligible to receive (i) additional contingent payments of up to $230.5 million upon the achievement of specified milestones based on (a) the submission and approval of BLAs for certain aesthetic and therapeutic indications and (b) first time calendar year net sales, and (ii) tiered royalty payments in low double digit to high teen percentages on annual net sales. The royalty percentages are subject to reduction in the event that (i) we do not have any valid and unexpired patent claims that cover the product in the Fosun Territory, (ii) biosimilars of the product are sold in the Fosun Territory or (iii) Fosun needs to pay compensation to third parties to either avoid patent infringement or market the product in the Fosun Territory.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nThe following table presents our revenue for the periods indicated and related changes from the prior period:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Milestone\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Relastin Royalty\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,323\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased compared to the same period in 2017 and 2016, primarily due to revenue recognized from the collaboration and license agreement with Mylan.\nIn February 2018, we entered into the Mylan Collaboration, pursuant to which we will collaborate with Mylan exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan) to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a biosimilar to BOTOX\u00ae. As part of the Mylan Collaboration, Mylan paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $25 million with additional contingent payments of up to $100 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory (i.e., biosimilar biological pathway) milestones and of specified, tiered sales milestones of up to $225 million. We recognized revenue based on the estimated cost of services incurred over the estimated cost of services to be provided for the development period.\nWe recognized royalty revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 related to the Relastin asset purchase and royalty agreement. In August 2011, we entered into the Relastin asset purchase and royalty agreement to sell the business related to our Relastin product line to PDI. The Relastin asset purchase and royalty agreement provided for a minimum royalty payment of $0.3 million per year, to be paid quarterly for up to 15 years from the execution date. PDI was subsequently acquired by Valeant in July 2014. On April 23, 2015, we received notice from Valeant terminating the asset purchase and royalty agreement effective as of July 23, 2015. We were entitled to the minimum royalty payment until Valeant returned the Relastin\u00ae intellectual property rights to us. In November 2017, we and Valeant entered into an asset transfer agreement to finalize the termination of the asset purchase and royalty agreement and Valeant returned the Relastin\u00ae intellectual property rights to us. We do not have any current plans for future developments of Relastin\u00ae and our primary focus is on the development of DAXI.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is our personnel costs including stock-based compensation. We expect our expenses to increase in the near term as we initiate and complete additional clinical trials and associated programs related to DAXI for the treatment of glabellar lines and indications in muscle movement and other disorders, such as cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, upper limb spasticity, chronic migraine, and our biosimilar product candidate.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Since our inception, we have focused on our clinical development programs and the related research and development. We have been developing DAXI, DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, and our biosimilar product candidate since 2002 and we have typically shared our employees, consultants and infrastructure resources across both programs. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:\n \u2022 salaries and related expenses for personnel in research and development functions, including stock-based compensation; \n \u2022 expenses related to the initiation and completion of clinical trials for DAXI and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, including expenses related to production of clinical supplies; \n \u2022 fees paid to clinical consultants, CROs and other vendors, including all related fees for investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis; \n \u2022 other consulting fees paid to third parties; \n \u2022 expenses related to establishment and maintenance of our own manufacturing facilities; \n \u2022 expenses related to the manufacture of drug substance and drug product supplies for ongoing and future preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-commercial supplies; \n \u2022 expenses to support our product development and establish manufacturing capabilities to support potential future commercialization of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; \n \u2022 expenses related to license fees and milestone payments under in-licensing agreements; \n \u2022 expenses related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements in the U.S., the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions; and \n \u2022 depreciation and other allocated expenses.  Our research and development expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties primarily related to the timing and cost needed to complete our respective projects. Further, the development timelines, probability of success and development expenses can differ materially from expectations and the completion of clinical trials may take several years or more depending on the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. Accordingly, the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development. We expect our research and development expenses to maintain or increase as we continue our clinical development of DAXI for the treatment of facial wrinkles and other neuroscience indications, such as cervical dystonia, plantar fasciitis, adult upper limb spasticity, and chronic migraine, any future new indications, and our biosimilar product candidate or if the FDA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials for approval.\nOur research and development expenses fluctuate as projects transition from one development phase to the next. Depending on the stage of completion and level of effort related to each development phase undertaken, we may reflect variations in our research and development expense. We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. We typically share employees, consultants and infrastructure resources among the programs related to DAXI, our biosimilar product candidate, and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical. We believe that the strict allocation of costs by product candidate would not be meaningful. As such, we generally do not track these costs by product candidate.\nOur research and development expenses are summarized as follows:\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clinical and regulatory\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing and quality efforts\n</td> <td>25,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>7,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other research and development expenses\n</td> <td>11,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical and regulatory\nClinical expenses include personnel costs, and external clinical trial costs for clinical sites, clinical research organizations, central laboratories, data management, contractors and regulatory activities associated with the development of DAXI and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical, including clinical trials of DAXI for the improvement of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia and plantar fasciitis. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, clinical and regulatory costs totaled $47.8 million, or 52%, $43.9 million, or 55%, and $15.1 million, or 30% of the total research and development expenses in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nClinical and regulatory costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 9%, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased costs related to hiring additional personnel and outside services to address compliance requirements and infrastructure build-out as well as studies related to cervical dystonia, adult upper limb spasticity, plantar fasciitis, forehead lines and lateral canthal lines, offset by a decrease in clinical trial costs"}
