MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nFormat of Presentation\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis. Our reportable operating segments are Americas outdoor advertising ( Americas\u201d) and International outdoor advertising ( International\u201d). Our Americas and International segments provide outdoor advertising services in their respective geographic regions using various digital and traditional display types.\nWe manage our operating segments primarily focusing on their operating income, while Corporate expenses, Other operating income (expense), net, Interest expense, Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications, Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates, Other income, net and Income tax benefit (expense) are managed on a total company basis and are, therefore, included only in our discussion of consolidated results.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.\nDescription of Our Business\nOur revenue is derived from selling advertising space on the displays we own or operate in key markets worldwide, consisting primarily of billboards, street furniture and transit displays. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients' advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets, both domestically and internationally.\nManagement typically monitors our business by reviewing the average rates, average revenue per display, occupancy, and inventory levels of each of our display types by market.\nWe own the majority of our advertising displays, which typically are located on sites that we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements. Our advertising contracts with clients typically outline the number of displays reserved, the duration of the advertising campaign and the unit price per display.\nThe significant expenses associated with our operations include direct production, maintenance and installation expenses as well as site lease expenses for land under our displays including revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed amounts payable under our billboard, street furniture and transit display contracts. Our direct production, maintenance and installation expenses include costs for printing, transporting and changing the advertising copy on our displays, the related labor costs, the vinyl and paper costs, electricity costs and the costs for cleaning and maintaining our displays. Vinyl and paper costs vary according to the complexity of the advertising copy and the quantity of displays. Our site lease expenses include lease payments for use of the land under our displays, as well as any revenue-sharing arrangements or minimum guaranteed amounts payable that we may have with the landlords. The terms of our site leases and revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed contracts generally range from one to 20 years.\nAmericas\nOur advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, type and size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points. Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of a market population. The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time. For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display.\nClient contract terms typically range from four weeks to one year for the majority of our display inventory in the United States. Generally, we own the street furniture structures and are responsible for their construction and maintenance. Contracts for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or are negotiated with private transit operators. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years.\nInternational\nSimilar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. The number of impressions delivered by a display, in some countries, is weighted to account for such factors as\nillumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic. In addition, because our International advertising operations are conducted in foreign markets, including Europe and Asia, management reviews the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis. A constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements.\nOur International display inventory is typically sold to clients through network packages, with client contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks with terms of up to one year available as well. Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays typically provide for terms ranging from three to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In our International business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities in exchange for which we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. A different regulatory environment for billboards and competitive bidding for street furniture and transit display contracts, which constitute a larger portion of our business internationally, may result in higher site lease costs in our International business.\nMacroeconomic Indicators\nOur advertising revenue for our Americas and International segments is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, estimated U.S. GDP growth for 2016 was 1.6%. Internationally, our results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as the economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations.\nRelationship with iHeartCommunications\nThere are several agreements which govern our relationship with iHeartCommunications including the Master Agreement, Corporate Services Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Trademark and License Agreement. iHeartCommunications has the right to terminate these agreements in various circumstances. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no notice of termination of any of these agreements has been received from iHeartCommunications. Our agreements with iHeartCommunications continued under the same terms and conditions subsequent to iHeartCommunications' merger.\nIn accordance with the Master Agreement, our branch managers follow a corporate policy allowing iHeartCommunications to use, without charge, Americas' displays they believe would otherwise be unsold. iHeartCommunications bears the cost of producing the advertising and we bear the costs of installing and removing this advertising.\nUnder the Corporate Services Agreement, iHeartCommunications provides management services to us. These services are charged to us based on actual direct costs incurred or allocated by iHeartCommunications based on headcount, revenue or other factors on a pro rata basis. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded approximately $36.0 million, $30.1 million and $31.2 million, respectively, as a component of corporate expenses for these services.\nThe Trademark License Agreement entitles us to use (1) on a nonexclusive basis, the \"Clear Channel\" trademark and the Clear Channel \"outdoor\" trademark logo with respect to day-to-day operations of our business worldwide and on the Internet, and (2) certain other Clear Channel marks in connection with our business. On February 9, 2017, we entered into a binding option and letter of intent with iHeartMedia granting us a binding option to purchase the registered trademarks and domain names owned by iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries that incorporate one or more of the words \"Clear\" and/or \"Channel,\" and any translations or derivations of any of the foregoing, together with any goodwill associated therewith. This option is exercisable in our sole and absolute discretion at any time between February 23, 2018 and February 23, 2019.\nOn August 9, 2010, iHeartCommunications announced that its board of directors approved a stock purchase program under which iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries may purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our Class A common stock and/or the Class A common stock of iHeartMedia. As of December 31, 2014, an aggregate $34.2 million was available under this program. In January 2015, a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications purchased an additional 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock for $20.4 million. On April 2, 2015, a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications purchased an additional 2,172,946 shares of the Company's Class A common stock for $22.2 million. As a result of this purchase, the stock purchase program concluded. The purchase of shares in excess of the amount available under the stock purchase program was separately approved by the iHeartCommunications' board of directors. As of December 31, 2016, iHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries held 10,726,917 shares of the Company's Class A common stock and all of the Company's class B common stock, which represented 89.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on a fully-diluted basis.\nExecutive Summary\nThe key developments in our business for the year ended December 31, 2016 are summarized below:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consolidated revenue decreased $103.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015.

Revenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d are calculated by converting the current period's revenues and expenses in local currency to U.S. dollars using average foreign exchange rates for the prior period.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,702,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,806,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>1,435,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,494,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>515,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>117,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>344,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>7,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income (expense), net\n</td> <td>354,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,452.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>637,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>374,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>50,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>(1,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>(70,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>241,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(76,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50,177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income (loss)\n</td> <td>164,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amount attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>23,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to the Company\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,072\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Revenue\nConsolidated revenue decreased $103.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding a $47.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $56.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenue is primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses which generated $248.9 million in revenue in 2015 and $123.5 million in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by revenues from new digital assets and new contracts.\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $59.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $29.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses decreased $30.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Lower direct operating expenses was primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses.\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $16.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $9.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $6.4 million during 2016 compared to 2015. SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, and were partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses increased $1.0 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $4.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses increased $5.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily resulting from higher litigation costs and higher expenses related to non-cash compensation plans.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $13.0 million and $20.3 million incurred in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2016, $2.7 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $7.8 million are reported within SG&A and $2.5 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2015, such costs totaled $9.2 million, $4.3 million, and $6.8 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $31.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized, the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses, as well as the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.\nImpairment Charges\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million during 2016 related to goodwill in one International business. During 2015, we recognized a $21.6 million impairment charge related to billboard permits in one Americas market. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nOther Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther operating income, net of $354.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the net gain of $278.3 million on sale of nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the net gain of $127.6 million on sale on our business in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $56.6 million loss, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments, on the sale of our business in Turkey in the second quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, Americas sold nine non-strategic markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida.\nOther operating expense, net of $4.8 million in 2015 primarily related to acquisition/disposition transaction costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $19.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the issuance by Clear Channel International B.V. of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nInterest income decreased $11.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015 due to the decrease in the average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note.\nEquity in Loss of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $1.7 million and $0.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther expense was $70.2 million for 2016. Other income was $12.4 million for 2015. These amounts relate primarily to net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies. The decline in value during 2016 of the British pound against the Euro impacted Euro-denominated notes payable by one of our UK subsidiaries, which was the primary driver of the foreign exchange loss in 2016.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% and was primarily impacted by the deferred tax benefits recorded in the current period for the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and France. The release of the valuation allowance of $32.9 million in the U.S. was primarily due to the taxable income generated from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and the release of valuation allowance in France of $43.3 million was due to positive evidence that now exists related to the Company's ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The deferred tax benefits described above were partially offset by $54.7 million in tax expense attributable to the sale of our business in Australia during the period.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was (237.5)% and was primarily impacted by the $32.9 million valuation allowance recorded during the period as additional deferred tax expense. The valuation allowance was recorded against a portion of the U.S. Federal and State net operating losses due to the uncertainty of the ability to utilize those losses in future periods. Additionally, the Company recorded additional taxes due to the inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nAmericas Outdoor Advertising Results of Operations\nOur Americas outdoor operating results were as follows:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,278,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,349,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>570,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>597,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>225,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>185,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>297,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>313,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmericas revenue decreased $70.6 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.7 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue decreased $62.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue is due to the $102.7 million impact of the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue resulting from these sales was partially offset by increased revenues from digital billboards from new deployments and higher occupancy on existing digital billboards, as well as new airport contracts, and higher revenues in Latin America.\nAmericas direct operating expenses decreased $27.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $3.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses decreased $23.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in direct operating expenses was driven by a $35.4 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher site lease expenses related to new airport contracts. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $7.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $2.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses decreased $5.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was due to a $20.4 million decrease in SG&A expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-\nstrategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense related to higher revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $18.9 million. Excluding the $0.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $18.1 million primarily due to the sale of the nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nInternational Outdoor Advertising Results of Operations\nOur International operating results were as follows:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,423,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,457,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>865,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>897,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>289,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>152,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInternational revenue decreased $33.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $39.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue increased $6.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in revenue is due to growth across most of our markets including China, Italy, Spain, Sweden, France and Belgium, primarily from new digital assets and new contracts. This growth was partially offset by a $22.7 million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively, as well as lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed.\nInternational direct operating expenses decreased $32.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $25.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses decreased $6.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by a $14.6 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia and lower rent expense due to lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed. These decreases were partially offset by higher site lease and production expenses in countries experiencing revenue growth. International SG&A expenses decreased $8.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses decreased $0.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $3.0 million decrease resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nIncluded in 2015 International Outdoor direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses are $8.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 to correct for accounting errors included in the results of our Netherlands subsidiary reported in prior years. Such corrections are not considered to be material to the prior year financial results.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $13.3 million. Excluding the $5.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $7.8 million primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,806,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,961,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>1,494,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,596,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>531,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>116,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>375,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>21,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>512.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>(4,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(166.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>261,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>355,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>353,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>61,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>(289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>12,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(21,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>(50,177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated loss\n</td> <td>(71,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amount attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>24,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to the Company\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,072\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,590\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Revenue\nConsolidated revenue decreased $155.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014.

International revenue decreased $153.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $205.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue increased $52.2 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by new contracts and the impact of sales initiatives.\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $102.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding an $146.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses increased $44.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014.

Excluding the $13.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses increased $4.7 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher variable site lease expenses related to the increase in revenues. International direct operating expenses decreased $93.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $133.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses increased $39.9 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of higher variable costs associated with higher revenue, as well as higher spending on strategic efficiency initiatives.\nConsolidated SG&A Expenses\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $17.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding a $51.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses increased $34.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014.

Excluding the $45.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses increased $28.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher compensation expense, including commissions in connection with higher revenues.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses decreased $14.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $3.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses decreased $11.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Corporate expenses were primarily impacted by lower spending related to our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $20.3 million incurred in 2015 in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2015, $9.2 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $4.3 million are reported within SG&A and $6.8 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2014, such costs totaled $3.5 million, $6.7 million, and $20.0 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $30.3 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized as well as the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.\nImpairment Charges\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $21.6 million during 2015 related to billboard permits in one Americas outdoor market. During 2014, we recognized a $3.5 million other intangible assets impairment charge in our Americas segment primarily related to a decline in the estimated fair value of permanent easements in two markets. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nOther Operating Income, Net\nOther operating expense, net of $4.8 million in 2015 primarily related to acquisition/disposition transaction costs.\nOther operating income, net of $7.3 million in 2014 primarily related to the gain on the sale of certain outdoor assets in our Americas segment.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $2.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nInterest income increased $1.3 million during 2015 compared to 2014 due to the increase in the average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note.\nEquity in Earnings (Loss) of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $0.3 million for 2015 included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nEquity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates of $3.8 million for 2014 included the earnings from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income of $12.4 million and $15.2 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to foreign exchange gains on short-term intercompany accounts.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was (237.5)% and was primarily impacted by the $32.9 million valuation allowance recorded during the period as additional deferred tax expense. The valuation allowance was recorded against a portion of the U.S. Federal and State net operating losses due to the uncertainty of the ability to utilize those losses in future periods. Additionally, the Company recorded additional taxes due to the inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nThe effective tax rate for 2014 was (105.5)%, primarily impacted by our benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate and an inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we recorded $20.0 million in net tax benefits associated with a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations to assess taxes in the United Kingdom and several state jurisdictions.\nAmericas Results of Operations\nOur Americas operating results were as follows:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,349,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,350,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>597,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>605,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>233,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>204,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>313,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmericas revenue decreased $1.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014.

We disclose in Item 8 of our Form 10-K within Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, that our policy is to permanently reinvest the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as these earnings are generally redeployed in those jurisdictions for operating needs and continued functioning of their businesses. We have the ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of consolidated subsidiaries based outside of the United States. If any excess cash held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund operations in the United States, we could presently repatriate available funds without a requirement to accrue or pay U.S. taxes. This is a result of significant deficits, as calculated for tax law purposes, in our foreign earnings and profits, which gives us flexibility to make future cash distributions as non-taxable returns of capital.\nOur primary uses of liquidity are for our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, special dividend and other funding requirements. Based on our current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, cash flows from operations, repayment of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note with iHeartCommunications and borrowing capacity under our senior revolving credit facility will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, special dividend and other funding requirements, including the debt service on the CCWH Senior Notes, the CCWH Subordinated Notes and the CCIBV Senior Notes for at least the next 12 months. We believe our long-term plans, which include promoting outdoor media spending, capitalizing on our diverse geographic and product opportunities and the continued deployment of digital displays, will enable us to continue generating cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our liquidity and funding requirements long term. However, our anticipated results are subject to significant uncertainty.\nOur ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, special dividend and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and cash from operations. If our future operating performance does not meet our expectations or our plans materially change in an adverse manner or prove to be materially inaccurate, we may need additional financing. We may not be able to secure any such additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we paid $757.8 million in special cash dividends to our stockholders. As described under Uses of Capital-Special Dividends\u201d below, in the first quarter of 2016, we paid a $217.8 million dividend from the proceeds of the issuance of 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 by Clear Channel International B.V. (\"CCIBV\"), one of our indirect subsidiaries, and a $540.0 million dividend with the proceeds of a $300 million repayment under the Due from iHeartCommunications note and the sale of our outdoor business in nine non-strategic markets. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we sold our business in Australia for cash proceeds of $195.7 million, net of cash retained by the purchaser and closing costs. On February 9, 2017, we declared a special cash dividend to our stockholders of $282.5 million, to be paid using proceeds from the sales of certain non-strategic U.S. markets and of our business in Australia. We paid the dividend on February 23, 2017, of which 89.9% or approximately $254.0 million was paid to iHeartCommunications, with the remaining 10.1% or approximately $28.5 million paid to our public stockholders. The payment of these special dividends reduces the amount of cash available to us for future working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements. Similarly, the repayment of the $300.0 million under the Due from iHeartCommunications note reduced the amount of the Due from iHeartCommunications note asset that is available to us as a source of liquidity. Future special cash dividends will be dependent upon, among other things, our having sufficient available cash.\nIn addition to any special dividends that our board of directors may declare using the proceeds of any liquidity-generating transactions or other available cash, we may declare special dividends using the proceeds of payments from iHeartCommunications under the Due from iHeartCommunications note. Our board of directors has established a committee that has the non-exclusive authority to demand payments under the Due from iHeartCommunications note under certain specified circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications' liquidity or the amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications note, as long as our board of directors declares a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded. Any future repayments and dividends would further reduce the amount of the Due from iHeartCommunications note asset that is available to us as a source of liquidity for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, special dividend and other funding requirements.\nAs our controlling stockholder, iHeartCommunications may request and may exert pressure on us to engage in transactions for the purpose of supporting its liquidity needs, such as financings or asset sales, which may negatively affect our business operations or our capital structure. In its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2017, iHeartCommunications stated that its forecast of future cash flows indicates that such cash flows would not be sufficient for it to meet its obligations, including payment of the outstanding receivables based credit facility balance at maturity on December 24, 2017, as they become due in the ordinary course of business for a period of at least 12 months following February 23, 2017. While iHeartCommunications stated that it believes that the refinancing or the extension of the maturity date of the receivables based credit facility, combined with current funds and expected future cash flows, will be sufficient to enable it to meet its obligations as they become due in the ordinary course of business for a period of at least 12 months following February 23, 2017, there is no assurance that the receivables based credit facility will be extended in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all.\niHeartCommunications provides the day-to-day cash management services for our cash activities and balances in the U.S. We do not have any material committed external sources of capital other than iHeartCommunications, and iHeartCommunications is not required to provide us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements. We have no access to the cash transferred from us to iHeartCommunications under the cash management arrangement other than our right to demand payment by iHeartCommunications of the amounts owed to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications note. As of December 31, 2016, iHeartCommunications had $845.0 million recorded as Cash and cash equivalents\u201d on its consolidated balance sheets, of which $542.0 million was held by us and our subsidiaries, and we had $885.7 million due to us from iHeartCommunications under the Due from iHeartCommunications note. Further deterioration in the financial condition or liquidity of iHeartCommunications could result in its inability to repay amounts due to us under the Due from iHeartCommunications note when demanded or at maturity, and could also have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs or impairing our access to capital markets. If iHeartCommunications were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, we would be an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications. In that event, we would be treated the same as other unsecured creditors of iHeartCommunications and, if we were not repaid or otherwise entitled to amounts outstanding or previously paid under the revolving promissory note, or could not obtain cash previously transferred to iHeartCommunications on a timely basis or retain cash previously received from iHeartCommunications, we could experience a liquidity shortfall.\nWe were in compliance with the covenants contained in our material financing agreements as of December 31, 2016. Our ability to comply with the maintenance covenant in our senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.\nIn its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2017, iHeartCommunications stated that it was in compliance with the covenants contained in its material financing agreements as of December 31, 2016, other than a payment default on notes held by a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications that has informed iHeartCommunications it does not intend to collect the principal amount due or exercise or request enforcement of any remedy with respect to the payment default under the applicable indenture. iHeartCommunications stated that this payment default is below the $100.0 million cross-default threshold in iHeartCommunications' debt documents. iHeartCommunications similarly stated in its Annual Report that its future results are subject to significant uncertainty and there can be no assurance it will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. iHeartCommunications stated in its Annual Report that these covenants include a requirement in its senior secured credit facilities that it receive an opinion from its auditors in connection with its year-end audit that is not subject to a \"going concern\" or like qualification or exception. Moreover, iHeartCommunications stated in its Annual Report that its ability to comply with the covenants in its material financing agreements may be affected by events beyond its control, including the uncertainties described under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Anticipated Cash Requirements\" in its Annual Report and prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. As discussed therein, the breach of any covenants set forth in iHeartCommunications' financing agreements would result in a default thereunder, and an event of default would permit the lenders under a defaulted financing agreement to declare all indebtedness thereunder to be immediately due and payable. In addition, iHeartCommunications stated in its Annual Report that if iHeartCommunications is unable to repay its obligations under any secured credit facility, the lenders could proceed against any assets that were pledged to secure such facility. Finally, iHeartCommunications stated in its Annual Report that a default or acceleration under any of its material financing agreements could cause a default under other obligations that are subject to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.\nWe frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business. We expect from time to time to dispose of certain businesses and may pursue acquisitions. These dispositions or acquisitions could be material.\nSources of Capital\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had the following debt outstanding, cash and cash equivalents and amounts due from iHeartCommunications:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings Senior Notes due 2022\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020\n</td> <td>2,200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Revolving Credit Facility due 2018\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clear Channel International B.V.

Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nPromissory Notes with iHeartCommunications\nWe maintain accounts that represent net amounts due to or from iHeartCommunications, which are recorded as Due from/to iHeartCommunications\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. The accounts represent our revolving promissory note issued by us to iHeartCommunications and the Due from iHeartCommunications note, in each case in the face amount of $1.0 billion, or if more or less than such amount, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all advances. The accounts accrue interest pursuant to the terms of the promissory notes and are generally payable on demand or when they mature on December 15, 2017. Included in the accounts are the net activities resulting from day-to-day cash management services provided by iHeartCommunications. Such day-to-day cash management services relate only to our cash activities and balances in the U.S. and exclude any cash activities and balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the asset recorded in Due from\niHeartCommunications\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet was $885.7 million and $930.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings under the cash management note to iHeartCommunications.\nIn accordance with the terms of the settlement for the derivative litigation filed by our stockholders regarding the Due from iHeartCommunications note, as previously disclosed, we established a committee of our board of directors, consisting of our independent and disinterested directors, for the specific purpose of monitoring the Due from iHeartCommunications note. This committee has the non-exclusive authority to demand payments under the Due from iHeartCommunications note under certain specified circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications' liquidity or the amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications note, as long as our board of directors declares a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded. The committee last made a demand under the Due from iHeartCommunications note on August 11, 2014. If future demands are made in accordance with the terms of the committee charter, we will declare a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded, which would further reduce the amount of the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d asset that is available to us as a source of liquidity for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements.\nThe net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $50.3 million, $61.4 million and $60.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the fixed interest rate on the Due from iHeartCommunications\u201d account was 6.5%, which is equal to the fixed interest rate on the CCWH senior notes. On October 23, 2013, in accordance with the terms of the settlement, the interest rate on the Due from iHeartCommunications note was amended such that if the outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note exceeds $1.0 billion and under certain other circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications' liquidity, the rate will be variable but will in no event be less than 6.5% nor greater than 20%.\nOur working capital requirements and capital for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, may be provided to us by iHeartCommunications, in its sole discretion, pursuant to a revolving promissory note issued by us to iHeartCommunications or pursuant to repayment of the Due from iHeartCommunications note. If we are unable to obtain financing from iHeartCommunications, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks or other lenders, or through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity, strategic relationships or other arrangements at some future date. As stated above, we may be unable to successfully obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nAs long as iHeartCommunications maintains a significant interest in us, pursuant to the Master Agreement between iHeartCommunications and us, iHeartCommunications will have the option to limit our ability to incur debt or issue equity securities, among other limitations, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. Under the Master Agreement with iHeartCommunications, we are limited in our borrowings from third parties to no more than $400.0 million at any one time outstanding, without the prior written consent of iHeartCommunications.\nCCWH Senior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2016, CCWH senior notes represented $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consisted of $735.8 million aggregate principal amount of Series A Senior Notes due 2022 (the Series A CCWH Senior Notes\u201d) and $1,989.2 million aggregate principal amount of Series B CCWH Senior Notes due 2022 (the Series B CCWH Senior Notes\u201d). The CCWH Senior Notes are guaranteed by us, Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. ( CCOI\u201d) and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nThe CCWH Senior Notes are senior obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of CCWH and the guarantees of the CCWH Senior Notes rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors. Interest on the CCWH Senior Notes is payable to the trustee weekly in arrears and to the noteholders on May 15 and November 15 of each year.\nAt any time prior to November 15, 2017, CCWH may redeem the CCWH Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the CCWH Senior Notes plus a make-whole\u201d premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. CCWH may redeem the CCWH Senior Notes, in whole or in part, on or after November 15, 2017, at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture governing the CCWH Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither CCOH nor any of its subsidiaries is permitted to make any purchase of, or otherwise effectively cancel or retire any Series A CCWH Senior Notes or Series B CCWH Senior Notes if, after giving effect thereto and, if applicable, any concurrent purchase of or other addition with respect to any Series B CCWH Senior Notes or Series A CCWH Senior Notes, as applicable, the ratio of (a) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series A CCWH Senior Notes to (b) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series B CCWH Senior Notes shall be greater than 0.25, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional debt to persons other than iHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries (other than us) or issue certain preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create liens on its restricted subsidiaries' assets to secure such debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the CCWH Senior Notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, the indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes provides that if CCWH (i) makes an optional redemption of the Series B CCWH Senior Notes or purchases or makes an offer to purchase the Series B CCWH Senior Notes at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an optional redemption or purchase a pro rata amount of the Series A CCWH Senior Notes or (ii) makes an asset sale offer under the indenture governing the Series B CCWH Senior Notes, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an offer to purchase a pro rata amount of Series A CCWH Senior Notes.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Senior Notes does not include limitations on dividends, distributions, investments or asset sales.\nThe indenture governing the Series B CCWH Senior Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>redeem, repurchase or retire our subordinated debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create liens on its or its restricted subsidiaries' assets to secure debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to it from its restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the CCWH Senior Notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sell certain assets, including capital stock of its subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>designate its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit us to incur additional indebtedness based on an incurrence test. In order to incur (i) additional indebtedness under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1 and 5.0:1 for total debt and senior debt, respectively, and (ii) additional indebtedness that is subordinated to the CCWH Senior Notes under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1 for total debt. The indentures contain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture also permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the proceeds from asset sales if our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) are lower than 7.0:1 and 5.0:1 for total debt and senior debt, respectively. The Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Senior Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture. There are other exceptions in these indentures that allow us to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. The exceptions in the Series B CCWH Senior Notes indenture that allow us to pay dividends include (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us.\nConsolidated leverage ratio, defined as total debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was 7.8:1 at December 31, 2016, and senior leverage ratio, defined as senior debt divided by EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) for the preceding four quarters was 4.2:1 at December 31, 2016. As required by the definition of EBITDA in the CCWH Senior Notes indentures, our EBITDA for the preceding four quarters of $661.2 million is calculated as operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and other operating income (expense), net, plus share-based compensation, and is further adjusted for the following: (i) costs incurred in connection with severance, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, retention charges, consulting fees and other permitted activities; (ii) extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains or losses or expenses; (iii) non-cash charges; and (iv) various other items.\nThe following table reflects a reconciliation of EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures) to operating income and net cash provided by operating activities for the four quarters ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Four Quarters Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>661.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less adjustments to EBITDA (as defined by the CCWH Senior Notes indentures):\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs incurred in connection with severance, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, retention charges, consulting fees and other permitted activities\n</td> <td>(15.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extraordinary, non-recurring or unusual gains or losses or expenses (as referenced in the definition of EBITDA in the CCWH Senior Notes indentures)\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash charges\n</td> <td>(10.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Depreciation and amortization, Impairment charges, Other operating income, net and Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>(6.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>637.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Depreciation and amortization, Impairment charges, Gain (loss) on disposal of operating and fixed assets and Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Interest expense\n</td> <td>(374.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Current income tax expense\n</td> <td>(45.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Other income, net\n</td> <td>(70.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to reconcile consolidated net loss to net cash provided by operating activities (including Provision for doubtful accounts, Amortization of deferred financing charges and note discounts, net and Other reconciling items, net)\n</td> <td>90.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in assets and liabilities, net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>24.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCCWH Senior Subordinated Notes\nAs of December 31, 2016, CCWH Subordinated Notes represented $2.2 billion of aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, which consist of $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series A Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d) and $1,925.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Series B Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d). Interest on the CCWH Subordinated Notes is payable to the trustee weekly in arrears and to the noteholders on March 15 and September 15 of each year.\nThe CCWH Subordinated Notes are CCWH's senior subordinated obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior subordinated basis by us, CCOI and certain of our other domestic subsidiaries. The CCWH Subordinated Notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior to all of CCWH's existing and future senior debt, including the CCWH Senior Notes, equally with any of CCWH's existing and future senior subordinated debt and ahead of all of CCWH's existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the CCWH Subordinated Notes. The guarantees of the CCWH Subordinated Notes rank junior to each guarantor's existing and future senior debt, including the CCWH Senior Notes, equally with each guarantor's existing and future senior subordinated debt and ahead of each guarantor's existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the guarantees of the CCWH Subordinated Notes.\nCCWH may redeem the CCWH Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable indenture governing the CCWH Subordinated Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Neither us nor any of our subsidiaries is permitted to make any purchase of, or otherwise effectively cancel or retire any Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes or Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes if, after giving effect thereto and, if applicable, any concurrent purchase of or other addition with respect to any Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes or Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes, as applicable, the ratio of (a) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes to (b) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes shall be greater than 0.25, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional debt to persons other than iHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries (other than us) or issue certain preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of CCOH's assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, the indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes provides that if CCWH (i) makes an optional redemption of the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes or purchases or makes an offer to purchase the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an optional redemption or purchase a pro rata amount of the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes or (ii) makes an asset sale offer under the indenture governing the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes, then CCWH shall apply a pro rata amount to make an offer to purchase a pro rata amount of Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes.\nThe indenture governing the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes does not include limitations on dividends, distributions, investments or asset sales.\nThe indenture governing the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes contains covenants that limit us and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>merge or consolidate with another person, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sell certain assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture and Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture restrict CCOH's ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit us to incur additional indebtedness based on an incurrence test. In order to incur additional indebtedness under this test, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) must be lower than 7.0:1. The indentures contain certain other exceptions that allow us to incur additional indebtedness. The Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture also permits us to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the proceeds from asset sales if its debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios (as defined by the indentures) is lower than 7.0:1. The Series A CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes indenture does not limit our ability to pay dividends. Because our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded the limit in the incurrence tests described above, we are not currently permitted to incur additional indebtedness using the incurrence test in the Series A CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture and the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture, and we are not currently permitted to pay dividends from the proceeds of indebtedness or the excess proceeds from asset sales under the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture. There are other exceptions in these indentures that allow us to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. The exceptions in the Series B CCWH Subordinated Notes indenture that allow us to pay dividends include (i) $525.0 million of dividends made pursuant to general restricted payment baskets and (ii) dividends made using proceeds received upon a demand by us of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note issued by iHeartCommunications to us.\nCCIBV Senior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2016, Clear Channel International B.V., an international subsidiary of ours, had $225.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 ( CCIBV Senior Notes\u201d).\nThe CCIBV Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The CCIBV Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of our International outdoor business's existing and future subsidiaries. The Company does not guarantee or otherwise assume any liability for the CCIBV Senior Notes. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of Clear Channel International B.V., and the guarantees of the notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors of the notes.\nClear Channel International B.V. may redeem the notes at its option, in whole or part, at any time prior to December 15, 2017, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Clear Channel International B.V. may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, on or after\nDecember 15, 2017, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. At any time on or before December 15, 2017, Clear Channel International B.V. may elect to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to 108.75% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings.\nThe indenture governing the CCIBV Senior Notes contains covenants that limit Clear Channel International B.V.'s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) create liens on assets; (v) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (vi) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; and (vii) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of Clear Channel International B.V.'s assets.\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility Due 2018\nDuring the third quarter of 2013, we entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. The revolving credit facility may be used for working capital needs, to issue letters of credit and for other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, and $65.4 million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility which reduce availability under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains a springing covenant that requires us to maintain a secured leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit facility) of not more than 1.5:1 that is tested at the end of a quarter if availability under the facility is less than 75% of the aggregate commitments under the facility. We were in compliance with the secured leverage ratio covenant as of December 31, 2016.\nOther Debt\nOther debt consists primarily of loans with international banks. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $14.8 million was outstanding as other debt.\niHeartCommunications' Debt Covenants\nThe iHeartCommunications' senior secured credit facility contains a significant financial covenant which requires iHeartCommunications to comply on a quarterly basis with a financial covenant limiting the ratio of its consolidated secured debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, to consolidated EBITDA for the preceding four quarters (maximum of 8.75:1). In its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2017, iHeartCommunications stated that it was in compliance with this covenant as of December 31, 2016.\nDispositions and Other\nIn the first quarter of 2016, Americas outdoor sold nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida. We recognized a net gain of $278.3 million related to the sale, which is included within Other operating income (expense), net.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Turkey. As a result, we recognized a net loss of $56.6 million, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon sale of the subsidiaries in Turkey.\nIn the fourth quarter 2016, International outdoor sold its business in Australia for cash proceeds of $195.7 million. As a result, we recognized a net gain of $127.6 million, which is net of $14.6 million in cumulative translation adjustments that were recognized upon the sale of our business in Australia.\nDuring 2014, we sold our 50% interest in Buspak, recognizing a gain on the sale of $4.5 million.\nUses of Capital\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas advertising\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International advertising\n</td> <td>143.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures are not of significant size individually and primarily relate to the ongoing deployment of digital displays and improvements to traditional displays in our Americas segment as well as new billboard and street furniture contracts and renewals of existing contracts in our International segment.\nSee the Contractual Obligations table under Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company's future capital expenditure commitments.\nPart of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as alternatives to traditional methods of displaying our clients' advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets. We believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these expenditures because we expect enhanced margins through: (i) lower cost of production as the advertisements will be digital and controlled by a central computer network, (ii) decreased down time on displays because the advertisements will be digitally changed rather than manually posted paper or vinyl on the face of the display, and (iii) incremental revenue through more targeted and time specific advertisements.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. Please see Item 3. Legal Proceedings within Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur short and long term cash requirements include minimum annual guarantees for our street furniture contracts and operating leases. Noncancelable contracts and operating lease requirements are included in our direct operating expenses, which historically have been satisfied by cash flows from operations. For 2017, we are committed to $137.4 million and $335.6 million for minimum annual guarantees and operating leases, respectively. Our long-term commitments for minimum annual guarantees, operating leases and capital expenditure requirements are included in the table below.\nCertain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period. The aggregate of these contingent payments, if performance targets are met, would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations.\nIn addition to the scheduled maturities on debt issued by CCWH and CCIBV, we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts. We lease office space, certain equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our advertising structures under long-term operating leases. Some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses (generally tied to the consumer price index), as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance.\nWe have minimum franchise payments associated with non-cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses, trains, bus shelters and terminals. The majority of these contracts contain rent provisions that are calculated as the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenue or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment.\nThe scheduled maturities of the CCWH Senior Notes, CCWH Subordinated Notes, CCIBV Senior Notes and other debt outstanding, and our future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable lease agreements, minimum payments under other non-cancelable contracts, capital expenditure commitments and other long-term obligations as of December 31, 2016, are as follows:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Payments due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCWH Senior Notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,725,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCIBV Senior Notes\n</td> <td>225,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Long-term Debt\n</td> <td>14,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>1,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable operating leases\n</td> <td>2,556,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>335,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,211,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable contracts\n</td> <td>1,745,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>363,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>415,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>411,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employment contracts\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>77,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits (2)\n</td> <td>23,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (3)\n</td> <td>235,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,172,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,084,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,737,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,742,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,607,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Interest payments on long-term debt consist primarily of interest on the CCWH Senior Notes, the CCWH Senior Subordinated Notes and the CCIBV Senior Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The non-current portion of the unrecognized tax benefits is included in the Thereafter\u201d column as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of additional cash payments, if any, at this time.

Our International segment typically experiences its strongest performance in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. We expect this trend to continue in the future.\nMARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in equity security prices, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe have operations in countries throughout the world. Foreign operations are measured in their local currencies. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations. We believe we mitigate a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations with a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our foreign operations reported net income of $121.1 million for year ended December 31, 2016. We estimate a 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 by $12.1 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have increased our net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 by a corresponding amount.\nThis analysis does not consider the implications that such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the U.S. or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities.\nInflation\nInflation is a factor in the economies in which we do business and we continue to seek ways to mitigate its effect. Inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages, salaries and equipment. Although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable, we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our outdoor display faces.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This update provides U.S. GAAP guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, the Company will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. This update provides a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2014-09 provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue resulting from contracts with customers and will supersede virtually all of the current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The Company expects to utilize the full retrospective method. The Company has substantially completed its evaluation of the potential changes from adopting the new standard on its future financial reporting and disclosures which included reviews of contractual terms for all of the Company's significant revenue streams and the development of an implementation plan. The Company continues to execute on its implementation plan, including detailed policy drafting and training of segment personnel. Based on its evaluation, the Company does not expect material changes to its 2016 or 2017 consolidated revenues, operating income or balance sheets as a result of the implementation of this standard.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new leasing standard presents significant changes to the balance sheets of lessees. Lessor accounting is updated to align with certain changes in the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard which was issued in the third quarter of 2015. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Income tax effects of share-based payment awards will be recognized in the income statement with the vesting or settlement of the awards and the record keeping for additional paid-in capital pools will no longer be necessary. Additionally, companies can make a policy election to either estimate forfeitures or recognize them as they occur. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the provisions of this new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. For an SEC filer, the standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). The new standard addresses the classification of cash flows related to certain cash receipts and cash payments. Additionally, the standard clarifies how the predominance principle should be used when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. First, an entity will apply the guidance in Topic 230 and other applicable topics. If there is no guidance for those cash receipts and cash payments, an entity will determine each separately identifiable source or use and classify the receipt or payment based on the nature of the cash flow. If a receipt or payment has aspects of more than one class of cash flows and\ncannot be separated, the classification will depend on the predominant source or use. The standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debt based on historical experience for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions.\nIf our agings were to improve or deteriorate resulting in a 10% change in our allowance, we estimated that our bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have changed by approximately $2.2 million.\nLeases\nThe most significant estimates used by management in accounting for leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows:\nExpected lease term Our expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term exceeds 75% of the leased asset's useful life. The expected lease term is also used in determining the depreciable life of the asset. An increase in the expected lease term will increase the probability that a lease may be considered a capital lease and will generally result in higher interest and depreciation expense for a leased property recorded on our balance sheet.\nIncremental borrowing rate The incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the minimum lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. An increase in the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the minimum lease payments and reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease.\nFair market value of leased asset The fair market value of leased property is generally estimated based on comparable market data as provided by third-party sources. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the leased property. A higher fair market value reduces the likelihood that a lease will be considered a capital lease.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including structures and other property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, are reported at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We estimate the useful lives for various types of advertising structures and other long-lived assets based on our historical experience and our plans regarding how we intend to use those assets. Advertising structures have different lives depending on their nature, with large format bulletins generally having longer depreciable lives and posters and other displays having shorter depreciable lives. Street furniture and transit displays are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or appropriate contractual periods, whichever is shorter. Our experience indicates that the estimated useful\nlives applied to our portfolio of assets have been reasonable, and we do not expect significant changes to the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets in the future. When we determine that structures or other long-lived assets will be disposed of prior to the end of their useful lives, we estimate the revised useful lives and depreciate the assets over the revised period. We also review long-lived assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. When specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable, the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair market value.\nWe use various assumptions in determining the remaining useful lives of assets to be disposed of prior to the end of their useful lives and in determining the current fair market value of long-lived assets that are determined to be unrecoverable. Estimated useful lives and fair values are sensitive to factors including contractual commitments, regulatory requirements, future expected cash flows, industry growth rates and discount rates, as well as future salvage values. Our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nIf actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.\nAnnual Impairment Test\nThe Company performs its annual impairment test on indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of July 1 of each year.\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our billboard permits, are reviewed annually for possible impairment using the direct valuation method as prescribed in ASC 805-20-S99. Under the direct valuation method, the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was calculated at the market level as prescribed by ASC 350-30-35. Under the direct valuation method, it is assumed that rather than acquiring indefinite-lived intangible assets as a part of a going concern business, the buyer hypothetically obtains indefinite-lived intangible assets and builds a new operation with similar attributes from scratch. Thus, the buyer incurs start-up costs during the build-up phase which are normally associated with going concern value. Initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flows model which results in value that is directly attributable to the indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nOur key assumptions using the direct valuation method are market revenue growth rates, market share, profit margin, duration and profile of the build-up period, estimated start-up capital costs and losses incurred during the build-up period, the risk-adjusted discount rate and terminal values. This data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average asset within a market.\nOn July 1, 2016, we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in no impairment charge\nIn determining the fair value of our billboard permits, the following key assumptions were used:\n\u2022Industry revenue growth forecast at 3.0% was used for the initial four-year period;\n\u20223.0% revenue growth was assumed beyond the initial four-year period;\n\u2022Revenue was grown over a build-up period, reaching maturity by year 2;\n\u2022Operating margins gradually climb to the industry average margin of up to 56.1%, depending on market size, by year 3; and\n\u2022Assumed discount rate of 7.5%.\nWhile we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions, and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profit margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billboard permits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,138,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,162,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1, 2016 was $4.0 billion while the carrying value was $1.0 billion. The estimated fair value of our billboard permits at July 1, 2015 was $3.1 billion while the carrying value was $1.1 billion.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test goodwill at interim dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit. To the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value, an impairment charge may be required to be recorded.\nThe discounted cash flow approach we use for valuing goodwill as part of the two-step impairment testing approach involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets, discounted to their present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present value.\nOn July 1, 2016, we performed our annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $7.3 million related to one of our International outdoor markets. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions:\n\u2022Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the periods 2016 through 2020. Our cash flow assumptions are based on detailed, multi-year forecasts performed by each of our operating segments, and reflect the advertising outlook across our businesses.\n\u2022Cash flows beyond 2020 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at 3.0%.\n\u2022In order to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value; we utilized a discount rate of approximately 8.0% to 11.5% for each of our reporting units.\nBased on our annual assessment using the assumptions described above, a hypothetical 10% reduction in the estimated fair value in each of our reporting units would not result in a material impairment condition.\nWhile we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of each of our reportable segments that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profit margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount rates\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>860,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>820,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTax Provisions\nOur estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or results from the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax authorities.\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if the Company believes it is more than likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized.\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our UTBs may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash.\nLitigation Accruals\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Based on current assumptions, we have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in these assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.\nManagement's estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nASC 410-20 requires us to estimate our obligation upon the termination or nonrenewal of a lease, to dismantle and remove our billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition.\nDue to the high rate of lease renewals over a long period of time, our calculation assumes all related assets will be removed at some period over the next 55 years. An estimate of third-party cost information is used with respect to the dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site. The interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on an estimated risk-adjusted credit rate for the same period. If our assumption of the risk-adjusted credit rate used to discount current year additions to the asset retirement obligation decreased approximately 1%, our liability as of December 31, 2016 would not be materially impacted. Similarly, if our assumption of the risk-adjusted credit rate increased approximately 1%, our liability would not be materially impacted.\nShare-Based Compensation\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility and forfeiture rates, among other factors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, our results of operations could be materially impacted.", "summary": "The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the financial condition and operational results of a company engaged in outdoor advertising.

"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nFormat of Presentation\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis. Our reportable operating segments are Americas outdoor advertising ( Americas\u201d) and International outdoor advertising ( International\u201d). Our Americas and International segments provide outdoor advertising services in their respective geographic regions using various digital and traditional display types.\nWe manage our operating segments primarily focusing on their operating income, while Corporate expenses, Other operating income (expense), net, Interest expense, Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications, Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates, Other income, net and Income tax benefit (expense) are managed on a total company basis and are, therefore, included only in our discussion of consolidated results.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.\nDescription of Our Business\nOur revenue is derived from selling advertising space on the displays we own or operate in key markets worldwide, consisting primarily of billboards, street furniture and transit displays. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients' advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets, both domestically and internationally.\nManagement typically monitors our business by reviewing the average rates, average revenue per display, occupancy, and inventory levels of each of our display types by market.\nWe own the majority of our advertising displays, which typically are located on sites that we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements. Our advertising contracts with clients typically outline the number of displays reserved, the duration of the advertising campaign and the unit price per display.\nThe significant expenses associated with our operations include direct production, maintenance and installation expenses as well as site lease expenses for land under our displays including revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed amounts payable under our billboard, street furniture and transit display contracts. Our direct production, maintenance and installation expenses include costs for printing, transporting and changing the advertising copy on our displays, the related labor costs, the vinyl and paper costs, electricity costs and the costs for cleaning and maintaining our displays. Vinyl and paper costs vary according to the complexity of the advertising copy and the quantity of displays. Our site lease expenses include lease payments for use of the land under our displays, as well as any revenue-sharing arrangements or minimum guaranteed amounts payable that we may have with the landlords. The terms of our site leases and revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed contracts generally range from one to 20 years.\nAmericas\nOur advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, type and size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points. Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of a market population. The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time. For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display.\nClient contract terms typically range from four weeks to one year for the majority of our display inventory in the United States. Generally, we own the street furniture structures and are responsible for their construction and maintenance. Contracts for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or are negotiated with private transit operators. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years.\nInternational\nSimilar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. The number of impressions delivered by a display, in some countries, is weighted to account for such factors as\nillumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic. In addition, because our International advertising operations are conducted in foreign markets, including Europe and Asia, management reviews the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis. A constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements.\nOur International display inventory is typically sold to clients through network packages, with client contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks with terms of up to one year available as well. Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays typically provide for terms ranging from three to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In our International business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities in exchange for which we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. A different regulatory environment for billboards and competitive bidding for street furniture and transit display contracts, which constitute a larger portion of our business internationally, may result in higher site lease costs in our International business.\nMacroeconomic Indicators\nOur advertising revenue for our Americas and International segments is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, estimated U.S. GDP growth for 2016 was 1.6%. Internationally, our results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as the economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations.\nRelationship with iHeartCommunications\nThere are several agreements which govern our relationship with iHeartCommunications including the Master Agreement, Corporate Services Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Trademark and License Agreement. iHeartCommunications has the right to terminate these agreements in various circumstances. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no notice of termination of any of these agreements has been received from iHeartCommunications. Our agreements with iHeartCommunications continued under the same terms and conditions subsequent to iHeartCommunications' merger.\nIn accordance with the Master Agreement, our branch managers follow a corporate policy allowing iHeartCommunications to use, without charge, Americas' displays they believe would otherwise be unsold. iHeartCommunications bears the cost of producing the advertising and we bear the costs of installing and removing this advertising.\nUnder the Corporate Services Agreement, iHeartCommunications provides management services to us. These services are charged to us based on actual direct costs incurred or allocated by iHeartCommunications based on headcount, revenue or other factors on a pro rata basis. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded approximately $36.0 million, $30.1 million and $31.2 million, respectively, as a component of corporate expenses for these services.\nThe Trademark License Agreement entitles us to use (1) on a nonexclusive basis, the \"Clear Channel\" trademark and the Clear Channel \"outdoor\" trademark logo with respect to day-to-day operations of our business worldwide and on the Internet, and (2) certain other Clear Channel marks in connection with our business. On February 9, 2017, we entered into a binding option and letter of intent with iHeartMedia granting us a binding option to purchase the registered trademarks and domain names owned by iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries that incorporate one or more of the words \"Clear\" and/or \"Channel,\" and any translations or derivations of any of the foregoing, together with any goodwill associated therewith. This option is exercisable in our sole and absolute discretion at any time between February 23, 2018 and February 23, 2019.\nOn August 9, 2010, iHeartCommunications announced that its board of directors approved a stock purchase program under which iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries may purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our Class A common stock and/or the Class A common stock of iHeartMedia. As of December 31, 2014, an aggregate $34.2 million was available under this program. In January 2015, a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications purchased an additional 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock for $20.4 million. On April 2, 2015, a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications purchased an additional 2,172,946 shares of the Company's Class A common stock for $22.2 million. As a result of this purchase, the stock purchase program concluded. The purchase of shares in excess of the amount available under the stock purchase program was separately approved by the iHeartCommunications' board of directors. As of December 31, 2016, iHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries held 10,726,917 shares of the Company's Class A common stock and all of the Company's class B common stock, which represented 89.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on a fully-diluted basis.\nExecutive Summary\nThe key developments in our business for the year ended December 31, 2016 are summarized below:\n \u2022 Consolidated revenue decreased $103.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding a $47.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $56.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. \n \u2022 We sold nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016. We sold our businesses in Turkey and Australia in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively. The markets had total revenues of $123.5 million in 2016 and $248.9 million in 2015 and we realized a net gain of $349.3 million on the sales of the markets. \n \u2022 We spent $13.0 million on strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives during 2016 to realign and improve our on-going business operations-a decrease of $7.3 million compared to 2015. \nRevenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d in this Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is presented because management believes that viewing certain financial results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates facilitates period to period comparisons of business performance and provides useful information to investors. Revenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d are calculated by converting the current period's revenues and expenses in local currency to U.S. dollars using average foreign exchange rates for the prior period.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\n\nConsolidated Revenue\nConsolidated revenue decreased $103.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding a $47.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $56.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenue is primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses which generated $248.9 million in revenue in 2015 and $123.5 million in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by revenues from new digital assets and new contracts.\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $59.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $29.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses decreased $30.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Lower direct operating expenses was primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses.\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $16.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $9.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $6.4 million during 2016 compared to 2015. SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, and were partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses increased $1.0 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $4.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses increased $5.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily resulting from higher litigation costs and higher expenses related to non-cash compensation plans.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $13.0 million and $20.3 million incurred in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2016, $2.7 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $7.8 million are reported within SG&A and $2.5 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2015, such costs totaled $9.2 million, $4.3 million, and $6.8 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $31.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized, the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses, as well as the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.\nImpairment Charges\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million during 2016 related to goodwill in one International business. During 2015, we recognized a $21.6 million impairment charge related to billboard permits in one Americas market. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nOther Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther operating income, net of $354.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the net gain of $278.3 million on sale of nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the net gain of $127.6 million on sale on our business in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $56.6 million loss, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments, on the sale of our business in Turkey in the second quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, Americas sold nine non-strategic markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida.\nOther operating expense, net of $4.8 million in 2015 primarily related to acquisition/disposition transaction costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $19.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the issuance by Clear Channel International B.V. of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nInterest income decreased $11.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015 due to the decrease in the average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note.\nEquity in Loss of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $1.7 million and $0.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther expense was $70.2 million for 2016. Other income was $12.4 million for 2015. These amounts relate primarily to net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies. The decline in value during 2016 of the British pound against the Euro impacted Euro-denominated notes payable by one of our UK subsidiaries, which was the primary driver of the foreign exchange loss in 2016.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% and was primarily impacted by the deferred tax benefits recorded in the current period for the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and France. The release of the valuation allowance of $32.9 million in the U.S. was primarily due to the taxable income generated from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and the release of valuation allowance in France of $43.3 million was due to positive evidence that now exists related to the Company's ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The deferred tax benefits described above were partially offset by $54.7 million in tax expense attributable to the sale of our business in Australia during the period.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was (237.5)% and was primarily impacted by the $32.9 million valuation allowance recorded during the period as additional deferred tax expense. The valuation allowance was recorded against a portion of the U.S. Federal and State net operating losses due to the uncertainty of the ability to utilize those losses in future periods. Additionally, the Company recorded additional taxes due to the inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nAmericas Outdoor Advertising Results of Operations\nOur Americas outdoor operating results were as follows:\n\nAmericas revenue decreased $70.6 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.7 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue decreased $62.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue is due to the $102.7 million impact of the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue resulting from these sales was partially offset by increased revenues from digital billboards from new deployments and higher occupancy on existing digital billboards, as well as new airport contracts, and higher revenues in Latin America.\nAmericas direct operating expenses decreased $27.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $3.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses decreased $23.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in direct operating expenses was driven by a $35.4 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher site lease expenses related to new airport contracts. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $7.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $2.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses decreased $5.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was due to a $20.4 million decrease in SG&A expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-\nstrategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense related to higher revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $18.9 million. Excluding the $0.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $18.1 million primarily due to the sale of the nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nInternational Outdoor Advertising Results of Operations\nOur International operating results were as follows:\n\nInternational revenue decreased $33.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $39.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue increased $6.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in revenue is due to growth across most of our markets including China, Italy, Spain, Sweden, France and Belgium, primarily from new digital assets and new contracts. This growth was partially offset by a $22.7 million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively, as well as lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed.\nInternational direct operating expenses decreased $32.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $25.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses decreased $6.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by a $14.6 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia and lower rent expense due to lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed. These decreases were partially offset by higher site lease and production expenses in countries experiencing revenue growth. International SG&A expenses decreased $8.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses decreased $0.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $3.0 million decrease resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nIncluded in 2015 International Outdoor direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses are $8.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 to correct for accounting errors included in the results of our Netherlands subsidiary reported in prior years. Such corrections are not considered to be material to the prior year financial results.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $13.3 million. Excluding the $5.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $7.8 million primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows:\n\nConsolidated Revenue\nConsolidated revenue decreased $155.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding a $229.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue increased $73.9 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Americas revenue decreased $1.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $23.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue increased $21.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by higher revenues from digital billboards and our Spectacolor business. International revenue decreased $153.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $205.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue increased $52.2 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by new contracts and the impact of sales initiatives.\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $102.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding an $146.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses increased $44.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Americas direct operating expenses decreased $8.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $13.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses increased $4.7 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher variable site lease expenses related to the increase in revenues. International direct operating expenses decreased $93.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $133.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses increased $39.9 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of higher variable costs associated with higher revenue, as well as higher spending on strategic efficiency initiatives.\nConsolidated SG&A Expenses\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $17.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding a $51.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses increased $34.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $0.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $6.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses increased $5.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily in Latin America. International SG&A expenses decreased $16.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $45.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses increased $28.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher compensation expense, including commissions in connection with higher revenues.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses decreased $14.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $3.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses decreased $11.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Corporate expenses were primarily impacted by lower spending related to our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $20.3 million incurred in 2015 in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2015, $9.2 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $4.3 million are reported within SG&A and $6.8 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2014, such costs totaled $3.5 million, $6.7 million, and $20.0 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $30.3 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized as well as the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.\nImpairment Charges\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $21.6 million during 2015 related to billboard permits in one Americas outdoor market. During 2014, we recognized a $3.5 million other intangible assets impairment charge in our Americas segment primarily related to a decline in the estimated fair value of permanent easements in two markets. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nOther Operating Income, Net\nOther operating expense, net of $4.8 million in 2015 primarily related to acquisition/disposition transaction costs.\nOther operating income, net of $7.3 million in 2014 primarily related to the gain on the", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nFormat of Presentation\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis. Our reportable operating segments are Americas outdoor advertising ( Americas\u201d) and International outdoor advertising ( International\u201d). Our Americas and International segments provide outdoor advertising services in their respective geographic regions using various digital and traditional display types.\nWe manage our operating segments primarily focusing on their operating income, while Corporate expenses, Other operating income (expense), net, Interest expense, Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications, Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates, Other income, net and Income tax benefit (expense) are managed on a total company basis and are, therefore, included only in our discussion of consolidated results.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.\nDescription of Our Business\nOur revenue is derived from selling advertising space on the displays we own or operate in key markets worldwide, consisting primarily of billboards, street furniture and transit displays. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients' advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets, both domestically and internationally.\nManagement typically monitors our business by reviewing the average rates, average revenue per display, occupancy, and inventory levels of each of our display types by market.\nWe own the majority of our advertising displays, which typically are located on sites that we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements. Our advertising contracts with clients typically outline the number of displays reserved, the duration of the advertising campaign and the unit price per display.\nThe significant expenses associated with our operations include direct production, maintenance and installation expenses as well as site lease expenses for land under our displays including revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed amounts payable under our billboard, street furniture and transit display contracts. Our direct production, maintenance and installation expenses include costs for printing, transporting and changing the advertising copy on our displays, the related labor costs, the vinyl and paper costs, electricity costs and the costs for cleaning and maintaining our displays. Vinyl and paper costs vary according to the complexity of the advertising copy and the quantity of displays. Our site lease expenses include lease payments for use of the land under our displays, as well as any revenue-sharing arrangements or minimum guaranteed amounts payable that we may have with the landlords. The terms of our site leases and revenue-sharing or minimum guaranteed contracts generally range from one to 20 years.\nAmericas\nOur advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, type and size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points. Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of a market population. The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time. For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display.\nClient contract terms typically range from four weeks to one year for the majority of our display inventory in the United States. Generally, we own the street furniture structures and are responsible for their construction and maintenance. Contracts for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or are negotiated with private transit operators. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years.\nInternational\nSimilar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. The number of impressions delivered by a display, in some countries, is weighted to account for such factors as\nillumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic. In addition, because our International advertising operations are conducted in foreign markets, including Europe and Asia, management reviews the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis. A constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements.\nOur International display inventory is typically sold to clients through network packages, with client contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks with terms of up to one year available as well. Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture and transit displays typically provide for terms ranging from three to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In our International business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities in exchange for which we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. A different regulatory environment for billboards and competitive bidding for street furniture and transit display contracts, which constitute a larger portion of our business internationally, may result in higher site lease costs in our International business.\nMacroeconomic Indicators\nOur advertising revenue for our Americas and International segments is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, estimated U.S. GDP growth for 2016 was 1.6%. Internationally, our results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as the economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations.\nRelationship with iHeartCommunications\nThere are several agreements which govern our relationship with iHeartCommunications including the Master Agreement, Corporate Services Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Trademark and License Agreement. iHeartCommunications has the right to terminate these agreements in various circumstances. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no notice of termination of any of these agreements has been received from iHeartCommunications. Our agreements with iHeartCommunications continued under the same terms and conditions subsequent to iHeartCommunications' merger.\nIn accordance with the Master Agreement, our branch managers follow a corporate policy allowing iHeartCommunications to use, without charge, Americas' displays they believe would otherwise be unsold. iHeartCommunications bears the cost of producing the advertising and we bear the costs of installing and removing this advertising.\nUnder the Corporate Services Agreement, iHeartCommunications provides management services to us. These services are charged to us based on actual direct costs incurred or allocated by iHeartCommunications based on headcount, revenue or other factors on a pro rata basis. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded approximately $36.0 million, $30.1 million and $31.2 million, respectively, as a component of corporate expenses for these services.\nThe Trademark License Agreement entitles us to use (1) on a nonexclusive basis, the \"Clear Channel\" trademark and the Clear Channel \"outdoor\" trademark logo with respect to day-to-day operations of our business worldwide and on the Internet, and (2) certain other Clear Channel marks in connection with our business. On February 9, 2017, we entered into a binding option and letter of intent with iHeartMedia granting us a binding option to purchase the registered trademarks and domain names owned by iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries that incorporate one or more of the words \"Clear\" and/or \"Channel,\" and any translations or derivations of any of the foregoing, together with any goodwill associated therewith. This option is exercisable in our sole and absolute discretion at any time between February 23, 2018 and February 23, 2019.\nOn August 9, 2010, iHeartCommunications announced that its board of directors approved a stock purchase program under which iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries may purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our Class A common stock and/or the Class A common stock of iHeartMedia. As of December 31, 2014, an aggregate $34.2 million was available under this program. In January 2015, a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications purchased an additional 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock for $20.4 million. On April 2, 2015, a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications purchased an additional 2,172,946 shares of the Company's Class A common stock for $22.2 million. As a result of this purchase, the stock purchase program concluded. The purchase of shares in excess of the amount available under the stock purchase program was separately approved by the iHeartCommunications' board of directors. As of December 31, 2016, iHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries held 10,726,917 shares of the Company's Class A common stock and all of the Company's class B common stock, which represented 89.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on a fully-diluted basis.\nExecutive Summary\nThe key developments in our business for the year ended December 31, 2016 are summarized below:\n \u2022 Consolidated revenue decreased $103.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding a $47.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $56.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. \n \u2022 We sold nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016. We sold our businesses in Turkey and Australia in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively. The markets had total revenues of $123.5 million in 2016 and $248.9 million in 2015 and we realized a net gain of $349.3 million on the sales of the markets. \n \u2022 We spent $13.0 million on strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives during 2016 to realign and improve our on-going business operations-a decrease of $7.3 million compared to 2015. \nRevenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d in this Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is presented because management believes that viewing certain financial results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates facilitates period to period comparisons of business performance and provides useful information to investors. Revenues and expenses excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements\u201d are calculated by converting the current period's revenues and expenses in local currency to U.S. dollars using average foreign exchange rates for the prior period.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,702,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,806,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>1,435,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,494,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>515,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>117,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>344,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>7,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income (expense), net\n</td> <td>354,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,452.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>637,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>261,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>374,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>50,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>(1,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>(70,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>241,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(76,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50,177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income (loss)\n</td> <td>164,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amount attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>23,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to the Company\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,072\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Revenue\nConsolidated revenue decreased $103.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding a $47.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue decreased $56.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenue is primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses which generated $248.9 million in revenue in 2015 and $123.5 million in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by revenues from new digital assets and new contracts.\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $59.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $29.0 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated direct operating expenses decreased $30.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Lower direct operating expenses was primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses.\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses\nConsolidated SG&A expenses decreased $16.3 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $9.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $6.4 million during 2016 compared to 2015. SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, and were partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses increased $1.0 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $4.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses increased $5.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily resulting from higher litigation costs and higher expenses related to non-cash compensation plans.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $13.0 million and $20.3 million incurred in 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives. The costs were incurred to improve revenue growth, enhance yield, reduce costs, and organize each business to maximize performance and profitability. These costs consist primarily of severance related to workforce initiatives, consolidation of locations and positions, consulting expenses and other costs incurred in connection with streamlining our businesses. These costs are expected to provide benefits in future periods as the initiative results are realized. Of these costs for 2016, $2.7 million are reported within direct operating expenses, $7.8 million are reported within SG&A and $2.5 million are reported within corporate expense. In 2015, such costs totaled $9.2 million, $4.3 million, and $6.8 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $31.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized, the sale of certain U.S. markets and International businesses, as well as the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.\nImpairment Charges\nWe perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill, billboard permits, and other intangible assets as of July 1 of each year. In addition, we test for impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that depreciable assets might be impaired. As a result of these impairment tests, during 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million during 2016 related to goodwill in one International business. During 2015, we recognized a $21.6 million impairment charge related to billboard permits in one Americas market. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the impairment charges.\nOther Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther operating income, net of $354.7 million in 2016 primarily related to the net gain of $278.3 million on sale of nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016 and the net gain of $127.6 million on sale on our business in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the $56.6 million loss, which includes $32.2 million in cumulative translation adjustments, on the sale of our business in Turkey in the second quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, Americas sold nine non-strategic markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for net proceeds of $592.3 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida.\nOther operating expense, net of $4.8 million in 2015 primarily related to acquisition/disposition transaction costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $19.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the issuance by Clear Channel International B.V. of its 8.75% Senior Notes due 2020 during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nInterest Income on Due From iHeartCommunications\nInterest income decreased $11.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015 due to the decrease in the average outstanding balance on the Due from iHeartCommunications note.\nEquity in Loss of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates of $1.7 million and $0.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, included the loss from our equity investments in our Americas and International segments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther expense was $70.2 million for 2016. Other income was $12.4 million for 2015. These amounts relate primarily to net foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in connection with intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies. The decline in value during 2016 of the British pound against the Euro impacted Euro-denominated notes payable by one of our UK subsidiaries, which was the primary driver of the foreign exchange loss in 2016.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nOur operations are included in a consolidated income tax return filed by iHeartMedia. However, for our financial statements, our provision for income taxes was computed as if we file separate consolidated federal income tax returns with our subsidiaries.\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% and was primarily impacted by the deferred tax benefits recorded in the current period for the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and France. The release of the valuation allowance of $32.9 million in the U.S. was primarily due to the taxable income generated from the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. outdoor markets during the first quarter of 2016 and the release of valuation allowance in France of $43.3 million was due to positive evidence that now exists related to the Company's ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The deferred tax benefits described above were partially offset by $54.7 million in tax expense attributable to the sale of our business in Australia during the period.\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was (237.5)% and was primarily impacted by the $32.9 million valuation allowance recorded during the period as additional deferred tax expense. The valuation allowance was recorded against a portion of the U.S. Federal and State net operating losses due to the uncertainty of the ability to utilize those losses in future periods. Additionally, the Company recorded additional taxes due to the inability to benefit from losses in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nAmericas Outdoor Advertising Results of Operations\nOur Americas outdoor operating results were as follows:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,278,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,349,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>570,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>597,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>225,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>185,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>297,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>313,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmericas revenue decreased $70.6 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.7 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue decreased $62.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue is due to the $102.7 million impact of the sale of nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue resulting from these sales was partially offset by increased revenues from digital billboards from new deployments and higher occupancy on existing digital billboards, as well as new airport contracts, and higher revenues in Latin America.\nAmericas direct operating expenses decreased $27.1 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $3.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas direct operating expenses decreased $23.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in direct operating expenses was driven by a $35.4 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-strategic markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher site lease expenses related to new airport contracts. Americas SG&A expenses decreased $7.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $2.1 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas SG&A expenses decreased $5.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease was due to a $20.4 million decrease in SG&A expenses resulting from the sale of the nine non-\nstrategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense related to higher revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $18.9 million. Excluding the $0.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $18.1 million primarily due to the sale of the nine non-strategic U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nInternational Outdoor Advertising Results of Operations\nOur International operating results were as follows:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,423,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,457,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses\n</td> <td>865,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>897,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>289,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>152,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInternational revenue decreased $33.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $39.9 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue increased $6.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in revenue is due to growth across most of our markets including China, Italy, Spain, Sweden, France and Belgium, primarily from new digital assets and new contracts. This growth was partially offset by a $22.7 million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia in the second and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively, as well as lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed.\nInternational direct operating expenses decreased $32.2 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $25.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International direct operating expenses decreased $6.8 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was driven by a $14.6 million decrease in direct operating expenses resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia and lower rent expense due to lower revenue in the United Kingdom as a result of the London bus shelter contract not being renewed. These decreases were partially offset by higher site lease and production expenses in countries experiencing revenue growth. International SG&A expenses decreased $8.5 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the $7.8 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International SG&A expenses decreased $0.7 million during 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a $3.0 million decrease resulting from the sale of our businesses in Turkey and Australia, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses.\nIncluded in 2015 International Outdoor direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses are $8.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 to correct for accounting errors included in the results of our Netherlands subsidiary reported in prior years. Such corrections are not considered to be material to the prior year financial results.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $13.3 million. Excluding the $5.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, depreciation and amortization decreased $7.8 million primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated or fully amortized.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,806,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,961,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct operating expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>1,494,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,596,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>531,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses (excludes depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>116,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>375,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges\n</td> <td>21,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>512.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>(4,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(166.5)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>261,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>355,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>353,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on Due from iHeartCommunications\n</td> <td>61,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>(289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>12,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(21,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>(50,177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated loss\n</td> <td>(71,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amount attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>24,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to the Company\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,072\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,590\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Revenue\nConsolidated revenue decreased $155.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014.

Americas revenue decreased $1.6 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $23.4 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Americas revenue increased $21.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by higher revenues from digital billboards and our Spectacolor business. International revenue decreased $153.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the $205.6 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, International revenue increased $52.2 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by new contracts and the impact of sales initiatives.\nConsolidated Direct Operating Expenses\nConsolidated direct operating expenses decreased $102.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014.

Excluding the $3.5 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, corporate expenses decreased $11.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Corporate expenses were primarily impacted by lower spending related to our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense.\nRevenue and Efficiency Initiatives\nIncluded in the amounts for direct operating expenses, SG&A and corporate expenses discussed above are expenses of $20.3 million incurred in 2015 in connection with our strategic revenue and efficiency initiatives.
