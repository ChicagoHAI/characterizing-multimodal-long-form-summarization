Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(All dollar amounts presented in tables are in thousands, except per share data. BP\u201d equates to basis points\u201d; N/ M\u201d equates to not meaningful\u201d; -\u201d equates to zero\u201d or doesn't round to a reportable number\u201d; and N/A\u201d equates to not applicable.\u201d Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.)\nThe information contained in this report may contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to Univest Financial Corporation (the Corporation) and its financial condition and results of operations that involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Corporation's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected or projected as discussed in forward-looking statements. A discussion of forward-looking statements and factors that might cause such a difference includes those discussed in Part I, Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d as well as those within this Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion below outlines the Corporation's critical accounting policies. For further information regarding accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nManagement, in order to prepare the Corporation's financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Corporation's financial statements. There are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions. Certain critical accounting policies, discussed below, could materially affect the results of operations and financial position of the Corporation should changes in circumstances require a change in related estimates or assumptions. The Corporation has identified the fair value measurement of investment securities available-for-sale, reserve for loan and lease losses and purchase accounting as areas with critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurement of Investment Securities Available-for-Sale: The Corporation designates its investment securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading. Each of these designations affords different treatment in the balance sheet and statement of income for market value changes affecting securities. Should evidence emerge that indicates that management's intent or ability to manage the securities as originally asserted is not supportable, securities in the held-to-maturity or available-for-sale designations may be re-categorized so that adjustments to either the balance sheet or statement of condition may be required.\nFair values for securities are determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers. The Corporation's independent pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flows and, when available, loan performance data. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service's evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. If at any time, the pricing service determines that it does have not sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security, the Corporation will utilize valuations from another pricing service. Management has a sufficient understanding of the third party service's valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of securities to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control.\nReserve for Loan and Lease Losses: Reserves for loan and lease losses are provided using techniques that specifically identify losses on impaired loans and leases, estimate losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases, and estimate the amount of unallocated reserve necessary to account for losses that are present in the loan and lease portfolio but not yet currently identifiable. The adequacies of these reserves are sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may affect the ability of borrowers to make contractual payments as well as the value of the collateral committed to secure such payments. Although management believes it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and the Corporation's results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while management believes it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with GAAP, our regulators, in reviewing the loan portfolio, may request us to increase our reserve for loan and lease losses based on judgments different from ours. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing reserve for loan and lease losses may not be adequate or increases may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>20\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase Accounting: The Corporation accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase accounting method. Purchase accounting requires the total purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including certain intangible assets that must be recognized. The Corporation completed the acquisitions of Fox Chase in July 2016 and Valley Green in January 2015, which generated significant amounts of fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities. The fair value adjustments assigned to assets and liabilities, as well as their related useful lives, are subject to judgment and estimation by management. In many cases, determining the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the Corporation to estimate cash flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest, which requires the utilization of significant estimates and judgment in accounting for the acquisition.\nThe most significant fair value determination relates to the valuation of acquired loan portfolios. Level 3 inputs are utilized to value the portfolio and include the use of present value techniques employing cash flow estimates and incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in estimating fair values. Specifically, management utilizes three separate fair value analyses which a market participant would employ in estimating the total fair value adjustment, which are: 1) interest rate loan fair value analysis; 2) general credit fair value analysis; and 3) specific credit fair value analysis. For loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration, the Corporation prepares a specific credit fair value adjustment. Actual performance of loans could differ from management's initial estimates. If a loan outperforms the original fair value estimate, the difference between the original estimate and the actual performance of the loan is accreted into net interest income. Therefore, the net interest margin may initially increase due to the discount accretion. The yields on acquired loans are expected to decline as the acquired loan portfolio pays down or matures and the discount decreases. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest rate margins and lower interest income in future periods. For more information, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under Item 8.\nValuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets, while the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The most significant other intangible asset is the core deposit intangible (CDI). In order to initially record the fair value of the CDI, the income approach is used. Estimates are based upon financial, economic, market and other conditions that exist at the time of the acquisition to develop the projected market interest rate, future interest and maintenance costs, and attrition rates. Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of the benefit of the asset or liability, the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset or liability, including the historical cash flows.\nReaders of the Corporation's financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the Corporation's current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances, business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the Corporation at that time.\nGeneral\nThe Corporation earns revenues primarily from the margins and fees generated from the lending and depository services to customers as well as fee-based income from trust, insurance, mortgage banking and investment services to customers. The Corporation seeks to achieve adequate and reliable earnings through business growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk to Board of Directors approved levels. Growth is pursued through expansion of current customer relationships and development of additional relationships with new offices and strategic acquisitions.\nThe principal component of earnings for the Corporation is net interest income, the income earned on loans and investments less the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin, the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, is impacted by several factors including market interest rates, economic conditions, loan and lease demand, and deposit activity. As interest rates increase, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to decrease in value; conversely, as interest rates decline, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to increase in value. The Corporation is in a slightly asset sensitive position and net interest income is projected to increase in a rising rate environment, however, actual results could be materially different than modeled, due to numerous factors influencing interest rates earned on new loans and investments as well as rates paid on new and existing deposits and new borrowings.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>21\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExecutive Overview\nThe Corporation's consolidated net income, earnings per share and return on average assets and average equity were as follows:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>1.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6 BP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45 BP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average equity\n</td> <td>8.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11 BP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391 BP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 versus 2017\nThe Corporation reported net income of $50.5 million, or $1.72 diluted earnings per share, for 2018 compared to net income of $44.1 million, or $1.64 diluted earnings per share for 2017. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 included a pre-tax charge to the provision for loan and lease losses of $10.9 million (after-tax charge of $8.6 million) which represented $0.29 diluted earnings per share, related to fraudulent activities by employees of a borrower. In addition, the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 included tax-free bank owned life insurance (BOLI) death benefit of $446 thousand during the second quarter of 2018, which represented $0.02 diluted earnings per share, offset by restructuring costs related to financial center closures of $451 thousand, net of tax, or $0.02 diluted earnings per share, recognized in the first quarter of 2018. There were no restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included a reduction in the Corporation's statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).\nThe financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a revaluation of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset associated with the passage of the TCJA. The revaluation, which was recorded as additional income tax expense, was $1.1 million, or $0.04 diluted earnings per share in 2017. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a tax-free BOLI death benefit of $889 thousand recognized in the second quarter of 2017, which represented $0.03 diluted earnings per share.\n2017 versus 2016\nThe Corporation reported net income of $44.1 million, or $1.64 diluted earnings per share, for 2017 compared to net income of $19.5 million, or $0.84 diluted earnings per share, for 2016. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a re-measurement of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The re-measurement, which was recorded as additional income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017, was $1.1 million, or $0.04 diluted earnings per share. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 also included a tax-free bank owned life insurance death benefit of $889 thousand recognized in the second quarter of 2017, which represented $0.03 diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016 included acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Fox Chase plus restructuring costs related to facility closures and staffing rationalization of $11.8 million, net of tax, or $0.51 diluted earnings per share. There were no acquisition, integration costs or restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. The results for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included a charge of $1.2 million, net of tax, or $0.05 diluted earnings per share related to the Corporation's agreement to settle its future obligations related to the acquisition of Girard Partners.\nIn December 2017, the Corporation completed its public offering of 2,645,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.25 per share, which resulted in an increase in shareholders' equity of $70.5 million. In July 2016, the Corporation issued 6,857,529 shares of common stock related to the Fox Chase acquisition, which resulted in an increase in shareholders' equity of $144.1 million.\nResults of Operations\nThe Corporation acquired Fox Chase on July 1, 2016. The comparative results of operations for 2017 versus 2016 include a full year of operations for the combined entities for the year ended December 31, 2017 and six months of combined operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>22\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income\nTable 1 presents a summary of the Corporation's average balances, tax-equivalent interest income, interest expense, the tax-equivalent yields earned on average assets, the cost of average liabilities, and shareholders' equity on a tax-equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The tax-equivalent net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The tax-equivalent net interest spread represents the weighted average tax-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets less the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of net interest-free funding sources represents the effect on the net interest margin of net funding provided by noninterest-earning assets, noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders' equity. Table 2 analyzes the changes in the tax-equivalent net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components.\nTable 1, Table 2, and the interest income and net interest income analysis contains tax-equivalent financial information and measures determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The management of the Corporation uses this non-GAAP financial information and measures in its analysis of the Corporation's performance. This financial information and measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis financial information or measures nor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of the non-GAAP financial information and measures provide useful information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of the Corporation.\nThe statutory federal tax rate utilized in the respective tables and analyses was 21% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 35% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\n2018 versus 2017\nReported net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $158.1 million, an increase of $14.9 million, or 10.4%, from the prior year. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $160.7 million, an increase of $11.9 million, or 8.0%, from the prior year. The increase in reported and tax-equivalent net interest income was primarily due to the growth in average loans of 10.4%, growth in interest free funding and 16.1% growth in average equity. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 3.72% compared to 3.78% for 2017 which incorporates the utilization of a 21% tax rate for 2018 and 35% for 2017. The favorable impact of purchase accounting accretion was two basis points ($1.0 million) for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to eight basis points ($3.0 million) for 2017.\n2017 versus 2016\nNet interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $148.8 million, an increase of $29.1 million, or 24.3%, from the prior year. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.78% compared to 3.82% for 2016. The increase in net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was mainly due to the impact of the Fox Chase acquisition, which occurred on July 1, 2016, organic loan growth and increases in loan yields partially offset by deposit growth and higher deposit costs. The favorable impact of purchase accounting accretion was eight basis points ($3.0 million) for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to nine basis points ($2.8 million) for 2016.\nTable 85:

basis for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $193.1 million, an increase of $24.5 million, or 14.5%, from 2017. The increase in interest income (tax-equivalent) was primarily due to organic loan growth in commercial real estate, commercial business and residential real estate loans. In addition, loan yields increased as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates 100 basis points in 2018 and 75 basis points in 2017. The favorable impact of purchase accounting accretion on interest-earning assets was one basis point ($383 thousand) for 2018, compared to a favorable impact of two basis points ($888 thousand) for 2017.\n2017 versus 2016\nInterest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $168.7 million, an increase of $36.6 million, or 27.7%, from 2016. The increase was mainly due to the impact of the Fox Chase acquisition and organic loan growth in commercial real estate, commercial business and residential real estate loans. In addition, loan yields increased slightly as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates a total of 100 basis points collectively in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017. The favorable impact of purchase accounting accretion on interest-earning assets was two basis points ($888 thousand) for 2017, compared to a favorable impact of five basis points ($1.4 million) for 2016.\nInterest Expense\n2018 versus 2017\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $32.4 million, an increase of $12.6 million, or 63.4%, from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher deposit and borrowing costs, which were impacted by the Federal Reserve interest rate increases in 2017 and 2018. The favorable impact of purchase accounting amortization on interest-bearing liabilities was two basis points ($654 thousand) for 2018, compared to a favorable impact of eight basis points ($2.1 million) for 2017.\n2017 versus 2016\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $19.8 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 60.2%, from 2016. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the Fox Chase acquisition, organic deposit growth and higher deposit costs. Deposits costs were impacted by the Federal Reserve interest rate increases in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017. The favorable impact of purchase accounting amortization on interest-bearing liabilities was eight basis points ($2.1 million) for 2017, compared to a favorable impact of six basis points ($1.4 million) for 2016.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe provision for loan and leases losses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $20.3 million, $9.9 million, and $4.8 million, respectively. Net loan and lease charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $12.5 million, $5.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The increase in both the provision for loan and lease losses and loan and lease charge-offs in 2018 was primarily due to a commercial loan net charge-off of $10.9 million previously discussed in the Executive Overview.\nThe provision for loan and lease losses increased in 2017 due to the increased charge-offs and a $690.5 million increase in originated loans. During 2017, the Corporation charged-off $2.8 million and recognized $2.8 million in provision for loan and lease losses related to $5.0 million of software leases under a vendor referral program.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>26\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trust fee income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>5,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment advisory commission and fee income\n</td> <td>15,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance commission and fee income\n</td> <td>15,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other service fee income\n</td> <td>9,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance income\n</td> <td>3,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(814\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sales of investment securities\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on mortgage banking activities\n</td> <td>3,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(898\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,004\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(484\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 versus 2017\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $60.2 million, an increase of $933 thousand, or 1.6%, compared to 2017. Investment advisory commission and fee income increased $1.6 million, or 12.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to new customer relationships and favorable market performance for the majority of 2018. Insurance commission and fee income increased $870 thousand, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in group life and health premiums and an increase in contingent commission income of $371 thousand, which is largely recognized in the first quarter of the year. Other service fee income increased $676 thousand, or 7.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in debit card interchange income, mortgage servicing fees and human resource and payroll consulting services within the insurance line of business. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $150 thousand, or 2.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased fee income on cash management accounts.\nBOLI income decreased $814 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to proceeds from death benefits of $446 thousand in 2018 as compared to $889 thousand in 2017 and a decrease in value of our non-qualified annuity portfolio of $109 thousand in 2018 compared to an increase of $343 thousand in 2017. The net gain on mortgage banking decreased $898 thousand, or 22.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in refinance mortgage volume, a shortage of housing supply and the Bank retaining, on balance-sheet, a higher percentage of its mortgage originations. Such on balance-sheet loans are predominantly hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. Other income decreased $484 thousand, or 64.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a net loss of $355 thousand related to valuations and sales of other real estate owned and sales of closed branches as compared to a net loss of $31 thousand of such assets in the prior year.\n2017 versus 2016\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $59.2 million, an increase of $3.3 million, or 5.9%, compared to 2016. Trust fee income increased $314 thousand, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in trust assets under management during 2017. Service charges on deposits increased $791 thousand, or 16.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to fees on deposit accounts acquired from Fox Chase. Investment advisory commission and fee income increased $2.0 million, or 17.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to new customer relationships and favorable market performance during 2017. Insurance commission and fee income increased $185 thousand, or 1.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Insurance contingent commission income was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $363 thousand from the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the decrease in contingent commission income, insurance commission and fee income increased $548 thousand or 4.2%. Other service fee income increased $820 thousand, or 10.5%, primarily due to interchange fee income, partially related to Fox Chase customers and an increase in mortgage servicing fee income mainly due to higher volume and lower amortization expense as a result of reduced loan prepayments. BOLI income increased $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to proceeds from BOLI death benefits of $889 thousand recognized in the second quarter of 2017 and policies acquired from Fox Chase. BOLI death benefits of $450 thousand were recognized in 2016. Other income increased $554 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly due to an increase in swap fee income of $308 thousand and an increase in net gains on sales of other real estate owned of $524 thousand partially offset by the loss on the sale of a closed Fox Chase branch of $309 thousand.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>27\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a decrease in the net gain on sale of securities of $470 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017.

the year ended December 31, 2018 was $137.2 million, an increase of $6.5 million, or 5.0%, compared to 2017. Salaries, benefits and commissions increased $4.6 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily attributable to additional staff hired to support revenue generation across all business lines, expansion of our financial center footprint in Lancaster County and annual merit increases. Data processing expense increased $514 thousand, or 6.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to increased investments in customer relationship management software, internal infrastructure improvements and outsourced data processing solutions. Marketing and advertising expense increased $315 thousand, or 21.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to deposit product campaigns and expenses related to re-branding our wealth management division during the fourth quarter of 2018. Other expense increased $804 thousand, or 3.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in Bank shares tax, loan processing expenses and increased corporate development expenses. Restructuring costs related to financial center closures and staffing rationalization were $571 thousand during the first quarter of 2018. There were no restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 versus 2016\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $130.7 million, a decrease of $11.3 million, or 7.9%, compared to 2016. Acquisition and integration costs related to the Fox Chase acquisition and restructuring costs were $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no acquisition, integration costs or restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, intangible expense decreased $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the settlement of the Girard Partners acquisition earn-out in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the conclusion of the earn-out period for the Sterner Insurance Associates acquisition, which resulted in a reversal of a prior accrual of $303 thousand during the second quarter of 2017.\nThese decreases were partially offset by the following increases in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Salaries, benefits and commissions increased $6.7 million, or 9.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily attributable to higher staffing levels resulting from the Fox Chase acquisition, additional staff hired to support revenue generation across all business lines and the expansion into Lancaster County. Premises and equipment expenses increased $1.4 million, or 10.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher premises expense related to Fox Chase locations and continued expansion into Philadelphia, Lancaster County and the Lehigh Valley. Data processing expense increased $1.5 million, or 21.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to increased investments in customer relationship management software and outsourced data processing solutions as well as the addition of Fox Chase processing expense. Other expense decreased $529 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the cost of a pension settlement of $1.4 million in 2016 partially offset by an increase\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>28\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nof $1.1 million related to Bank shares tax as a result of a statutory rate increase in 2017 and the Bank's growth following the Fox Chase acquisition.\nTax Provision\nThe provision for income taxes was $10.1 million, $17.7 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, at effective rates of 16.7%, 28.7%, and 16.6%, respectively. The effective tax rates reflect the reduction in the statutory federal tax rate to 21% in 2018 compared to 35% in 2017 and 2016. Additionally, the effective tax rates reflect the excess tax benefits from equity compensation activity and the benefits of tax-exempt income from investments in municipal securities and loans and leases and bank-owned life insurance. For 2016, these benefits were partially offset by non-deductible merger expenses.\nThe Corporation's effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was favorably impacted by discrete tax benefits and proceeds from BOLI death benefits. Excluding these discrete items, the effective tax rate was 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Corporation completed the calculations of provisional items with the completion of the 2017 tax returns. The impact of the completed calculations to the re-measurement of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset resulted in an income tax benefit of $300 thousand which the Corporation recorded in 2018.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was impacted by the TCJA due to the re-measurement of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset. The re-measurement adjustment of the net deferred tax asset was recorded as additional income tax expense of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, the Corporation recognized a BOLI death benefit of $889 thousand in the second quarter of 2017 and a discrete tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock and exercise of stock options of $684 thousand for 2017 which provided a tax deduction greater than previously recorded. This change was in accordance with ASU No. 2016-09, which was implemented by the Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2016 and requires the impact of such equity-based compensation activities to be recorded as an adjustment to the income tax provision in the period incurred, rather than an adjustment to equity. Excluding these items, the effective tax rate was 28.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Condition\nASSETS\nThe following table presents assets at the dates indicated:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and interest-earning deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities\n</td> <td>473,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>454,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank and other stock, at cost\n</td> <td>28,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans held for sale\n</td> <td>1,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans and leases held for investment\n</td> <td>4,006,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,620,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserve for loan and lease losses\n</td> <td>(29,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,555\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,809\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premises and equipment, net\n</td> <td>59,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and other intangibles, net\n</td> <td>184,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,919\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance\n</td> <td>111,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued interest receivable and other assets\n</td> <td>38,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,984,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,554,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>429,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Securities\nTotal investment securities at December 31, 2018 increased $19.2 million from December 31, 2017.

Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because debt issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties. Therefore, the stated yield may not be recognized in future periods. Additionally, residential mortgage-backed securities, which are collateralized by residential mortgage loans, typically prepay at a rate faster than stated maturity. Equity securities have no stated maturity and the current dividend yields may not be recognized in future periods. The weighted average yield is calculated by dividing income, which has not been tax equated on tax-exempt obligations, within each contractual maturity range by the outstanding amount of the related investment.

for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans and leases. Performance of the loan and lease portfolio is monitored on a regular basis by Bank management and lending officers.\nLoans and leases are deemed impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all proceeds due according to the contractual terms of the agreement or when a loan or lease is classified as a troubled debt restructuring. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, borrower cash flows, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.\nWhen a loan or lease, including a loan or lease that is impaired, is classified as nonaccrual, the accrual of interest on such a loan or lease is discontinued. A loan or lease is typically classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan or lease is currently performing. A loan or lease may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed and the amortization of net deferred fees and costs is suspended. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans and leases are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management's judgment as to the ultimate collectability of principal.\nLoans or leases are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.\nAt December 31, 2018, the recorded investment in loans and leases held for investment that were considered to be impaired was $26.6 million. The related reserve for loan and lease losses was $1.4 million. At December 31, 2017, the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired was $29.7 million. The related reserve for loan and lease losses was $131\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>31\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthousand. During 2018, one commercial real estate loan in the amount of $12.3 million was placed on non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2018, the loan had a carrying balance of $11.5 million due to pay-downs during 2018. This was partially offset by an accruing troubled debt restructured commercial real estate loans for another borrower totaling $10.3 million being returned to performing status during the first quarter of 2018 as the borrower was in compliance with the modified terms of the restructuring for the required time period. The impaired loan and lease balances consisted mainly of commercial real estate loans and business loans. Impaired loans and leases include nonaccrual loans and leases and accruing troubled debt restructured loans and lease modifications for which it is probable that not all principal and interest payments due will be collectible in accordance with the contractual terms. The amount of the specific reserve needed for these credits could change in future periods subject to changes in facts and judgments related to these credits. Specific reserves have been established based on current facts and management's judgments about the ultimate outcome of these credits. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, additional interest income that would have been recognized under the original terms for impaired loans was $1.7 million, $889 thousand and $909 thousand, respectively. Interest income recognized on impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $382 thousand, $1.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\nOther real estate owned was $1.2 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $1.8 million at December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, two residential properties with a carrying value of $403 thousand and two parcels of land with a carrying value of $74 thousand were transferred to other real estate owned and four residential properties with a carrying value of $423 thousand were sold for a net gain of $67 thousand. Additionally, the market value of a parcel of land was written down by $460 thousand based on an agreement to sell the property. The carrying value of four other properties were written down by $233 thousand to reflect current market conditions for the underlying properties.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>32\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 7-Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans and Leases; Troubled Debt Restructured Loans and Lease Modifications; Other Real Estate Owned; and Related Ratios\nThe following table details information pertaining to the Corporation's nonperforming assets at the dates indicated.

at a level representing management's best estimate of known risks and inherent losses in the portfolio, based upon management's evaluation of the portfolio's collectability. Management evaluates the need to establish reserves against losses on loans and leases on a quarterly basis. When changes in the reserve are necessary, an adjustment is made.\nThe reserve for loan and lease losses consists of a reserve for impaired loans and leases and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the originated portfolio. Although management determines the amount of each element of the reserve separately, the entire reserve for loan and lease losses is available for losses on the portfolio. The Corporation does not provide a reserve for loan loss for acquired loans unless additional deterioration of the portfolio is identified over the projections utilized in the initial fair value analysis. After the acquisition measurement period, the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows of acquired credit impaired loans will generally result in an impairment charge recorded as a provision for loan losses.\nReserve Required for Impaired Loans and Leases\nA loan or lease is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect future payments of principal or interest as contractually due. The Bank applies its normal loan review procedures in determining if a loan is impaired, which includes reviewing the collectability of delinquent and internally classified loans on a regular basis and at least quarterly. In determining the likelihood of collecting principal and interest, the Bank considers all available and relevant information, including the borrower's actual and projected cash flows, balance sheet strength, liquidity and overall financial position. Additionally, all loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired. When a loan is classified as impaired, an impairment analysis is performed within the quarter in which a loan is identified as impaired to determine if a specific reserve is needed. The Bank re-examines each impaired loan on a quarterly basis to determine if any adjustment to the valuation allowance or net carrying amount of a loan is required. The Bank recognizes charge-offs associated with impaired loans when all or a portion of a loan is considered to be uncollectible. In measuring impairment, the Bank determines whether or not the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is collateral dependent if repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral, which includes repayment from the proceeds from the sale of the collateral, cash flows from the continued operation of the collateral, or both, and there are no other available and reliable repayment sources. To determine the initial amount of impairment for a collateral dependent loan, the Bank utilizes a recent appraisal, an agreement of sale or a letter of intent. If the fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell, is less than the loan's carrying amount, the Bank adds a provision to the reserve for loan and lease losses in the amount of the difference between fair value, less costs to sell, and the loan or lease's carrying amount. In subsequent periods, the Bank takes into consideration current facts and circumstances in analyzing whether the fair value of the collateral has increased or decreased significantly such that a change to the corresponding valuation allowance is required. If current facts and circumstances are insufficient to determine fair value, the Bank obtains a new appraisal.\nFor loans that are not collateral dependent, the Bank establishes a specific reserve on impaired loans based on management's estimate of the discounted cash flows the Bank expects to receive from the borrower. Factors considered in evaluating such cash flows include: (1) the strength of the customer's personal or business cash flows and personal guarantees; (2) the borrower's effort to cure the delinquency; (3) the availability of other sources of repayment; (4) the type and value of collateral, if applicable; and (5) the strength of our collateral position, if applicable.\nGeneral Reserve on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio\nThe Bank establishes a general reserve for loans and leases that are not considered impaired to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities. This general reserve is determined by segmenting the loan portfolio and assigning reserve factors to each category. The reserve factors are calculated using the Bank's historical losses and loss emergence periods, and are adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors include:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio and in the terms of loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>34\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the quality of the institution's loan review system;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the institution's existing portfolio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporation maintains a reserve in other liabilities for off-balance sheet credit exposures that currently are unfunded in categories with historical loss experience.

charged-off $12.7 million related to a commercial loan borrower. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Corporation recovered $1.8 million related to this previously charged-off loan. See Note 5, \"Loans and Leases\" of the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. During 2017, the Corporation charged-off $2.8 million related to $5.0 million of software leases under a vendor referral program. The decrease in charge-off activity in commercial, financial and agricultural loans during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to improvements in asset quality.\nTable 9-Loan and Lease Loss Reserves\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the percentage of loans and leases in each major loan category to total loans and leases held for investment at the dates indicated.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial and agricultural loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate loans\n</td> <td>19,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans to individuals\n</td> <td>484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financings\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses to nonaccrual loans and leases, including nonaccrual troubled debt restructured loans and lease modifications, was 112.04% at December 31, 2018, 148.48% at December 31, 2017 and 97.67% at December 31, 2016.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>35\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2018, the specific allowance on impaired loans was $1.4 million, or 5.3% of the balance of impaired loans of $26.6 million.

The allocated reserves for real estate loans increased by $6.1 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to growth in real estate loans and a $902 increase in specific reserves for impaired loans.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets have been recorded on the books of the Corporation in connection with acquisitions. The Corporation has core deposit and customer-related intangibles and servicing rights, which are not deemed to have an indefinite life and therefore will continue to be amortized over their useful life using the present value of projected cash flows. The amortization of these intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $3.4 million, $4.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively. The Corporation also has goodwill with a net carrying value of $172.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, which is deemed to be an indefinite intangible asset and is not amortized.\nThe Corporation completes a goodwill impairment analysis at least on an annual basis, or more often, if events and circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. The Corporation also completes an impairment test for other identifiable intangible assets on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate there may be impairment. There was no impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangibles recorded during 2016 through 2018. There can be no assurance that future impairment assessments or tests will not result in a charge to earnings.\nBank Owned Life Insurance\nThe Bank purchases bank owned life insurance to protect itself against the loss of key employees due to death and to offset or finance the Corporation's future costs and obligations to employees under its benefit plans. Bank owned life insurance increased $3.4 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to $1.6 million of policies purchased during 2018 and BOLI income on the underlying policies.\nLIABILITIES\nThe following table presents liabilities at the dates indicated:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,885,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,554,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>189,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>145,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes\n</td> <td>94,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued interest payable and other liabilities\n</td> <td>44,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,360,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,951,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits\nTotal deposits grew $331.0 million, or 9.3%, from December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in commercial, public funds and consumer time deposits.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>36\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 10-Deposits\nThe following table summarizes the average amount of deposits for the periods indicated:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,069,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>751,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing checking deposits\n</td> <td>461,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market savings\n</td> <td>764,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>582,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>414,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regular savings\n</td> <td>798,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>847,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>601,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>566,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>512,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total average deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,696,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,407,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,779,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits with balances of $100 thousand or more.

December 31, 2017 was primarily related to an increase in retained earnings of $31.4 million. Retained earnings was impacted by net income of $50.5 million and the reclassification of $3.9 million and $433 thousand from accumulated other comprehensive income related to the January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-02, respectively, partially offset by cash dividends declared of $23.5 million. Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by $10.6 million from December 31, 2017 mainly attributable to decreases in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities of $5.8 million, net of tax, and the reclassification of retained earnings from the previously discussed adoption of ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-02 ($3.0 million related to the defined benefit pension plans and $1.4 million related to investment securities). Treasury stock increased $2.3 million from December 31, 2017 primarily related to purchases of $3.6 million under the Corporation's share repurchase program partially offset by a reduction in treasury stock of $1.2 million related to the issuance of restricted stock.\nDiscussion of Segments\nThe Corporation has three operating segments: Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance. Detailed segment information appears in Note 22, \"Segment Reporting\" included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K (Note 22 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nBanking segment, as presented in Note 22 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, reports a pre-tax income of $56.0 million in 2018, $59.0 million in 2017 and $31.5 million in 2016. See the section of this MD&A under the heading Net Interest Income\", Interest Income\u201d, Interest Expense\u201d, and Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d for a discussion of the Banking Segment.\nWealth Management segment, as presented in Note 22 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, reports a pre-tax income of $7.2 million in 2018, $6.7 million in 2017 and $2.4 million in 2016 and noninterest income of $23.2 million in 2018, $21.7 million in 2017 and $19.3 million in 2016. Noninterest income has increased primarily due to new customer relationships and favorable market performance throughout 2016, 2017 and most of 2018. Intangible expense decreased $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the settlement of the Girard Partners acquisition earn-out in the fourth quarter of 2016. Wealth Management assets under management and supervision were $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2018, $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2017, and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in assets under management and supervision as of December 31, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017, was primarily a result of the decrease in the equity markets in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nInsurance segment, as presented in Note 22 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, reports a pre-tax income of $7.2 million in 2018, $6.7 million in 2017 and $2.4 million in 2016 and noninterest income of $16.4 million in 2018, $15.3 million in 2017 and $15.2 million in 2016. Noninterest income has increased primarily due to increases in group life and health premiums, contingent commission income, and payroll and human resources consulting services.\nCapital Adequacy\nCapital guidelines, which banking regulators have adopted, assign minimum capital requirements for categories of assets depending on their assigned risks. The components of risk-based capital for the Corporation are Tier 1 and Tier 2. Minimum required total risk-based capital is 8.00%. In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules revising the agencies' capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules, designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. The rules are discussed in Note 20, Regulatory Matters,\u201d included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Corporation adopted the new Basel III regulatory capital rules during the first quarter of 2015 under the transition rules,\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>38\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nprimarily relating to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting common equity tier 1 capital and tier 1 capital, to be phased in over a four-year period beginning January 1, 2015. Additionally under Basel III rules, the decision was made to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. During 2018, the Corporation and the Bank were required to hold a capital conservation buffer greater than 1.875% above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions. The Corporation and the Bank were in compliance with these requirements for 2018. During 2019, the Corporation and the Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.50% above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Corporation had a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.88% and total risk-based capital ratio of 13.70%. At December 31, 2017, the Corporation had a Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.11% and total risk-based capital ratio of 14.00%. The Corporation continues to be in the well-capitalized\u201d category under regulatory standards. Details on the capital ratios can be found in Note 20, Regulatory Matters,\u201d included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K along with a discussion on dividend and other restrictions.\nAsset/Liability Management\nThe primary functions of Asset/Liability Management are to assure adequate earnings, capital and liquidity while maintaining an appropriate balance between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Liquidity management involves the ability to meet the Corporation's cash flow requirements, including those of our customers. Management's objective with regard to interest rate risk is to understand the Corporation's sensitivity to changes in interest rates and develop and implement strategies to minimize volatility while maximizing net interest income.\nThe Corporation uses gap analysis and earnings at risk simulation modeling to quantify exposure to interest rate risk. The Corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long-term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short-term rate exposures. The Corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the impact of declining or rising interest rates on net interest income over a one-year and two-year horizon. The simulation uses expected cash flows and repricing characteristics for all financial instruments at a point in time and incorporates company developed, market-based assumptions regarding growth, pricing, and optionality such as prepayment speeds. As interest rates increase, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to decrease in value; conversely, as interest rates decline, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to increase in value.\nCredit Risk\nExtending credit exposes the Corporation to credit risk, which is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan. The Corporation manages credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to consistent standards, guidelines and limitations established by the Board of Directors. Written loan policies establish underwriting standards, lending limits and other standards or limits as deemed necessary and prudent. While the Corporation has strict underwriting, review, and monitoring procedures in place, these procedures cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these lending activities.\nThe loan review department conducts ongoing, independent reviews of the lending process to ensure adherence to established policies and procedures, monitors compliance with applicable laws and regulations, provides objective measurement of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, and ensures that proper documentation exists.\nThe Corporation focuses on both assessing the borrower's capacity and willingness to repay and on obtaining sufficient collateral. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans are generally secured by the borrower's assets and by personal guarantees. Commercial real estate loans are originated primarily within the Southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey market areas at prudent loan-to-value ratios and are often supported by a guarantee of the borrowers. Management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that any credit concentrations by borrower or industry are closely monitored.\nThe Corporation originates fixed-rate and adjustable-rate real estate-residential mortgage loans that are secured by the underlying 1- to 4-family residential properties for personal purposes. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-equity ratios, credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than 80%. Residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the 80% loan-to-value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance.\nCredit risk in the consumer loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and, if secured, collateral values. In the home equity loan portfolio, combined loan-to-value ratios are generally limited to 80%, but increased to 85% for the Corporation's strongest profile borrower. Other credit considerations and compensating factors may warrant higher combined loan-to-value ratios.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>39\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe primary risks that are involved with lease financing receivables are credit underwriting and borrower industry concentrations. The Corporation has strict underwriting, review, and monitoring procedures in place to mitigate this risk. Risk also lies in the residual value of the underlying equipment. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, the Corporation bears the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value. The Corporation greatly reduces this risk primarily by using $1.00 buyout leases, in which the entire cost of the leased equipment is included in the contractual payments, leaving no residual payment at the end of the lease term.\nThe Corporation closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining asset quality. Collection efforts begin after a loan payment is missed, by attempting to contact all borrowers. If collection attempts fail, the Corporation will proceed to gain control of any and all collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses. While liquidation and recovery efforts continue, officers continue to work with the borrowers, if appropriate, to recover all monies owed to the Corporation.\nLiquidity\nThe Corporation, in its role as a financial intermediary, is exposed to certain liquidity risks. Liquidity refers to the Corporation's ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demand for loans, deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and certificates of deposit at maturity, operating expense, and capital expenditures. The Corporation manages liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring liquidity sources and estimated funding needs on a daily basis. The Corporation has a contingency funding plan in place to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution-specific or a systemic financial crisis.\nSources of Funds\nCore deposits continue to be the largest significant funding source for the Corporation. These deposits are primarily generated from a base of individuals, businesses, municipalities and non-profit customers located in our primary service areas. The Corporation faces increased competition for these deposits from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mutual funds, security dealers and others.\nAs part of its diversified funding strategy, the Corporation also utilizes a mix of short-term and long-term wholesale funding providers. Wholesale funding includes federal funds purchases from correspondent banks, secured borrowing lines from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and, at times, brokered deposits and other similar sources.\nThe Corporation, through the Bank, has a credit facility with the FHLB with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying amount of overnight borrowings with the FHLB was $108.3 million and $30.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying amount of long-term borrowings with the FHLB was $125.0 million. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank had outstanding short-term letters of credit with the FHLB totaling $347.5 million and $234.2 million, respectively, which were utilized to collateralize public funds deposits. The maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB changes as a function of qualifying collateral assets as well as the FHLB's internal credit rating of the Bank.\nThe Corporation, through the Bank, maintains uncommitted federal fund lines with several correspondent banks that totaled $367.0 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had outstanding federal funds purchased with these correspondent banks of $60.0 million and $55.0 million, respectively. Future availability under these lines is subject to the prerogatives of the granting banks and may be withdrawn at will.\nThe Corporation, through the Bank, holds collateral at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in order to access the Discount Window Lending program. The collateral consisting of investment securities was valued at $69.5 million and $52.0 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this program.\nThe Corporation has a $10.0 million line of credit with a correspondent bank. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this line.\nCash Requirements\nThe Corporation has cash requirements for various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that require cash payments. The following contractual obligations and commitments table presents, at December 31, 2018, significant\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>40\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nfixed and determinable contractual obligations and commitments to third parties. The most significant contractual obligation, in both the under and over one year time period, is for the Bank to repay its certificates of deposit and short-term and long-term borrowings. The Bank anticipates meeting these obligations by continuing to provide convenient depository and cash management services through its financial center network, thereby replacing these contractual obligations with similar fund sources at rates that are competitive in our market. The Bank will also use borrowings and brokered deposits to meet its obligations.\nThe table also shows the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments at December 31, 2018. These commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. Commitments to extend credit are the Bank's most significant commitment in both the under and over one year time periods.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe Corporation enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and its asset/liability management and to meet required capital needs. These obligations require the Corporation to make cash payments over time as detailed in the table that follows.\nThe Corporation is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to manage the Corporation's exposure to fluctuation in interest rates and to support loan growth. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby and performance letters of credit and forward loan sale contracts. These financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of these financial instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Corporation has in particular classes of financial instruments.\nThe Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby and performance letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, the Corporation does not require and is not required to pledge collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. These commitments expire over time as detailed in Table 12.\nTable 12-Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows, including interest payable, at December 31, 2018. The contractual amounts to be paid on variable rate obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. Future changes in the market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due in One Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after One Year to Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after Three Years to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due in Over Five Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt and interest\n</td> <td>151,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes (a)\n</td> <td>133,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits (b)\n</td> <td>691,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>401,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>55,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby, performance and other letters of credit\n</td> <td>61,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to extend credit (c)\n</td> <td>1,276,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>594,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net asset/liability derivative loan commitments (d)\n</td> <td>437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term obligations (e)\n</td> <td>14,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,575,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,058,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>526,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>744,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotes: (a) Includes interest for fixed and variable rate components.

Minimizing the balance sheet's maturity and repricing risk is a continual focus in a changing interest rate environment. The Corporation uses a variety of techniques to assist in identifying the potential range of risk. A simulation model is utilized to prepare a maturity/repricing Gap analysis as well as an Earnings at Risk analysis under various interest rate scenarios.\nThe gap analysis identifies interest rate risk by identifying re-pricing gaps in the Corporation's balance sheet. The model is based on expected cash flows and re-pricing characteristics for all financial instruments at a point in time and incorporates Corporation developed, market influenced assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on these financial instruments. All assets and liabilities are modeled to reflect some level of behavioral optionality, such as prepayments on loans, early call features on investments or potential pricing change and/or product change to interest bearing deposits. The Corporation projects all non-interest bearing deposits to be considered non-rate sensitive. These assumptions are based upon historic behavior; however, they are inherently uncertain and thus cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates. While actual results will differ from simulated results due to customer behavioral change and/or market and regulatory influences, the following models are important tools to guide management.\nTable

The following table demonstrates the anticipated impact of an instantaneous and parallel interest rate shift, or \"shock,\" to the yield curve on the Corporation's net interest income over the next twelve months. This simulation incorporates the same assumptions noted above and assumes a static balance sheet with no incremental growth in interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities over the next twelve months.\nThe changes to net interest income are shown in the below table at December 31, 2018. The results suggest the Corporation's year-end balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive as net interest income is projected to increase in a rising rate environment. The level of asset sensitivity decreased slightly from prior year-end results as a loan beta of 50% was recently added to new loan volume in the model to reflect competitive pricing in a changing rate environment. The changes to net interest income shown below are in compliance with the Corporation's policy guidelines.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Change in Net Interest Income Over Next 12 Months\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate shock - Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+300 basis points\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200 basis points\n</td> <td>8,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100 basis points\n</td> <td>3,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100 basis points\n</td> <td>(7,178\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.23\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-200 basis points\n</td> <td>(15,829\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe down 200 basis points rate scenario was included in the above table as short-term rates have exceeded 2.00% during the latter half of 2018.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>", "summary": "The report contains Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Univest Financial Corporation.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(All dollar amounts presented in tables are in thousands, except per share data.

The Corporation's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected or projected as discussed in forward-looking statements. A discussion of forward-looking statements and factors that might cause such a difference includes those discussed in Part I, Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d as well as those within this Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion below outlines the Corporation's critical accounting policies. For further information regarding accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nManagement, in order to prepare the Corporation's financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Corporation's financial statements. There are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions. Certain critical accounting policies, discussed below, could materially affect the results of operations and financial position of the Corporation should changes in circumstances require a change in related estimates or assumptions. The Corporation has identified the fair value measurement of investment securities available-for-sale, reserve for loan and lease losses and purchase accounting as areas with critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurement of Investment Securities Available-for-Sale: The Corporation designates its investment securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading. Each of these designations affords different treatment in the balance sheet and statement of income for market value changes affecting securities. Should evidence emerge that indicates that management's intent or ability to manage the securities as originally asserted is not supportable, securities in the held-to-maturity or available-for-sale designations may be re-categorized so that adjustments to either the balance sheet or statement of condition may be required.\nFair values for securities are determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers. The Corporation's independent pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flows and, when available, loan performance data. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service's evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. If at any time, the pricing service determines that it does have not sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security, the Corporation will utilize valuations from another pricing service. Management has a sufficient understanding of the third party service's valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of securities to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control.\nReserve for Loan and Lease Losses: Reserves for loan and lease losses are provided using techniques that specifically identify losses on impaired loans and leases, estimate losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases, and estimate the amount of unallocated reserve necessary to account for losses that are present in the loan and lease portfolio but not yet currently identifiable. The adequacies of these reserves are sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may affect the ability of borrowers to make contractual payments as well as the value of the collateral committed to secure such payments. Although management believes it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and the Corporation's results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while management believes it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with GAAP, our regulators, in reviewing the loan portfolio, may request us to increase our reserve for loan and lease losses based on judgments different from ours. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing reserve for loan and lease losses may not be adequate or increases may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\n 20 \nPurchase Accounting: The Corporation accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase accounting method. Purchase accounting requires the total purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including certain intangible assets that must be recognized. The Corporation completed the acquisitions of Fox Chase in July 2016 and Valley Green in January 2015, which generated significant amounts of fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities. The fair value adjustments assigned to assets and liabilities, as well as their related useful lives, are subject to judgment and estimation by management. In many cases, determining the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the Corporation to estimate cash flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest, which requires the utilization of significant estimates and judgment in accounting for the acquisition.\nThe most significant fair value determination relates to the valuation of acquired loan portfolios. Level 3 inputs are utilized to value the portfolio and include the use of present value techniques employing cash flow estimates and incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in estimating fair values. Specifically, management utilizes three separate fair value analyses which a market participant would employ in estimating the total fair value adjustment, which are: 1) interest rate loan fair value analysis; 2) general credit fair value analysis; and 3) specific credit fair value analysis. For loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration, the Corporation prepares a specific credit fair value adjustment. Actual performance of loans could differ from management's initial estimates. If a loan outperforms the original fair value estimate, the difference between the original estimate and the actual performance of the loan is accreted into net interest income. Therefore, the net interest margin may initially increase due to the discount accretion. The yields on acquired loans are expected to decline as the acquired loan portfolio pays down or matures and the discount decreases. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest rate margins and lower interest income in future periods. For more information, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under Item 8.\nValuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets, while the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The most significant other intangible asset is the core deposit intangible (CDI). In order to initially record the fair value of the CDI, the income approach is used. Estimates are based upon financial, economic, market and other conditions that exist at the time of the acquisition to develop the projected market interest rate, future interest and maintenance costs, and attrition rates. Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of the benefit of the asset or liability, the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset or liability, including the historical cash flows.\nReaders of the Corporation's financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the Corporation's current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances, business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the Corporation at that time.\nGeneral\nThe Corporation earns revenues primarily from the margins and fees generated from the lending and depository services to customers as well as fee-based income from trust, insurance, mortgage banking and investment services to customers. The Corporation seeks to achieve adequate and reliable earnings through business growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk to Board of Directors approved levels. Growth is pursued through expansion of current customer relationships and development of additional relationships with new offices and strategic acquisitions.\nThe principal component of earnings for the Corporation is net interest income, the income earned on loans and investments less the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin, the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, is impacted by several factors including market interest rates, economic conditions, loan and lease demand, and deposit activity. As interest rates increase, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to decrease in value; conversely, as interest rates decline, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to increase in value. The Corporation is in a slightly asset sensitive position and net interest income is projected to increase in a rising rate environment, however, actual results could be materially different than modeled, due to numerous factors influencing interest rates earned on new loans and investments as well as rates paid on new and existing deposits and new borrowings.\n 21 \nExecutive Overview\nThe Corporation's consolidated net income, earnings per share and return on average assets and average equity were as follows:\n\n2018 versus 2017\nThe Corporation reported net income of $50.5 million, or $1.72 diluted earnings per share, for 2018 compared to net income of $44.1 million, or $1.64 diluted earnings per share for 2017. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 included a pre-tax charge to the provision for loan and lease losses of $10.9 million (after-tax charge of $8.6 million) which represented $0.29 diluted earnings per share, related to fraudulent activities by employees of a borrower. In addition, the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 included tax-free bank owned life insurance (BOLI) death benefit of $446 thousand during the second quarter of 2018, which represented $0.02 diluted earnings per share, offset by restructuring costs related to financial center closures of $451 thousand, net of tax, or $0.02 diluted earnings per share, recognized in the first quarter of 2018. There were no restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included a reduction in the Corporation's statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).\nThe financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a revaluation of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset associated with the passage of the TCJA. The revaluation, which was recorded as additional income tax expense, was $1.1 million, or $0.04 diluted earnings per share in 2017. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a tax-free BOLI death benefit of $889 thousand recognized in the second quarter of 2017, which represented $0.03 diluted earnings per share.\n2017 versus 2016\nThe Corporation reported net income of $44.1 million, or $1.64 diluted earnings per share, for 2017 compared to net income of $19.5 million, or $0.84 diluted earnings per share, for 2016. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a re-measurement of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset associated with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The re-measurement, which was recorded as additional income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017, was $1.1 million, or $0.04 diluted earnings per share. The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 also included a tax-free bank owned life insurance death benefit of $889 thousand recognized in the second quarter of 2017, which represented $0.03 diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016 included acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Fox Chase plus restructuring costs related to facility closures and staffing rationalization of $11.8 million, net of tax, or $0.51 diluted earnings per share. There were no acquisition, integration costs or restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. The results for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included a charge of $1.2 million, net of tax, or $0.05 diluted earnings per share related to the Corporation's agreement to settle its future obligations related to the acquisition of Girard Partners.\nIn December 2017, the Corporation completed its public offering of 2,645,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.25 per share, which resulted in an increase in shareholders' equity of $70.5 million. In July 2016, the Corporation issued 6,857,529 shares of common stock related to the Fox Chase acquisition, which resulted in an increase in shareholders' equity of $144.1 million.\nResults of Operations\nThe Corporation acquired Fox Chase on July 1, 2016. The comparative results of operations for 2017 versus 2016 include a full year of operations for the combined entities for the year ended December 31, 2017 and six months of combined operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n 22 \nNet Interest Income\nTable 1 presents a summary of the Corporation's average balances, tax-equivalent interest income, interest expense, the tax-equivalent yields earned on average assets, the cost of average liabilities, and shareholders' equity on a tax-equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The tax-equivalent net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The tax-equivalent net interest spread represents the weighted average tax-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets less the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of net interest-free funding sources represents the effect on the net interest margin of net funding provided by noninterest-earning assets, noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders' equity. Table 2 analyzes the changes in the tax-equivalent net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components.\nTable 1, Table 2, and the interest income and net interest income analysis contains tax-equivalent financial information and measures determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The management of the Corporation uses this non-GAAP financial information and measures in its analysis of the Corporation's performance. This financial information and measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis financial information or measures nor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of the non-GAAP financial information and measures provide useful information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of the Corporation.\nThe statutory federal tax rate utilized in the respective tables and analyses was 21% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 35% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\n2018 versus 2017\nReported net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $158.1 million, an increase of $14.9 million, or 10.4%, from the prior year. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $160.7 million, an increase of $11.9 million, or 8.0%, from the prior year. The increase in reported and tax-equivalent net interest income was primarily due to the growth in average loans of 10.4%, growth in interest free funding and 16.1% growth in average equity. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 3.72% compared to 3.78% for 2017 which incorporates the utilization of a 21% tax rate for 2018 and 35% for 2017. The favorable impact of purchase accounting accretion was two basis points ($1.0 million) for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to eight basis points ($3.0 million) for 2017.\n2017 versus 2016\nNet interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $148.8 million, an increase of $29.1 million, or 24.3%, from the prior year. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.78% compared to 3.82% for 2016. The increase in net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was mainly due to the impact of the Fox Chase acquisition, which occurred on July 1, 2016, organic loan growth and increases in loan yields partially offset by deposit growth and higher deposit costs. The favorable impact of purchase accounting accretion was eight basis points ($3.0 million) for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to nine basis points ($2.8 million) for 2016.\n 23 \nTable 1-Average Balances and Interest Rates-Tax-Equivalent Basis\n\n(1) The average rate for these categories utilizes a statutory federal tax rate of 21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and 2016, which reduces the reported Average Rate for 2018 as compared to 2017 and 2016.\nNotes: For rate calculation purposes, average loan and lease categories include deferred fees and costs, purchase accounting adjustments, and unearned discount.\nNonaccrual loans and leases have been included in the average loan and lease balances.\nLoans held for sale have been included in the average loan balances.\nTax-equivalent amounts for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 have been calculated using the Corporation's federal applicable rate of 21%, 35% and 35%, respectively.\n 24 \nTable 2-Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\nThe rate-volume variance analysis set forth in the table below compares changes in tax-equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, indicated by their rate and volume components. The change in interest income/expense due to both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

The Corporation's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected or projected as discussed in forward-looking statements. A discussion of forward-looking statements and factors that might cause such a difference includes those discussed in Part I, Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d as well as those within this Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion below outlines the Corporation's critical accounting policies. For further information regarding accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nManagement, in order to prepare the Corporation's financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Corporation's financial statements. There are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions. Certain critical accounting policies, discussed below, could materially affect the results of operations and financial position of the Corporation should changes in circumstances require a change in related estimates or assumptions. The Corporation has identified the fair value measurement of investment securities available-for-sale, reserve for loan and lease losses and purchase accounting as areas with critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurement of Investment Securities Available-for-Sale: The Corporation designates its investment securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading. Each of these designations affords different treatment in the balance sheet and statement of income for market value changes affecting securities. Should evidence emerge that indicates that management's intent or ability to manage the securities as originally asserted is not supportable, securities in the held-to-maturity or available-for-sale designations may be re-categorized so that adjustments to either the balance sheet or statement of condition may be required.\nFair values for securities are determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers. The Corporation's independent pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flows and, when available, loan performance data. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service's evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. If at any time, the pricing service determines that it does have not sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security, the Corporation will utilize valuations from another pricing service. Management has a sufficient understanding of the third party service's valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of securities to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control.\nReserve for Loan and Lease Losses: Reserves for loan and lease losses are provided using techniques that specifically identify losses on impaired loans and leases, estimate losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases, and estimate the amount of unallocated reserve necessary to account for losses that are present in the loan and lease portfolio but not yet currently identifiable. The adequacies of these reserves are sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may affect the ability of borrowers to make contractual payments as well as the value of the collateral committed to secure such payments. Although management believes it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and the Corporation's results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while management believes it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with GAAP, our regulators, in reviewing the loan portfolio, may request us to increase our reserve for loan and lease losses based on judgments different from ours. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing reserve for loan and lease losses may not be adequate or increases may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\n 20 \nPurchase Accounting: The Corporation accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase accounting method. Purchase accounting requires the total purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including certain intangible assets that must be recognized. The Corporation completed the acquisitions of Fox Chase in July 2016 and Valley Green in January 2015, which generated significant amounts of fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities. The fair value adjustments assigned to assets and liabilities, as well as their related useful lives, are subject to judgment and estimation by management. In many cases, determining the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the Corporation to estimate cash flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest, which requires the utilization of significant estimates and judgment in accounting for the acquisition.\nThe most significant fair value determination relates to the valuation of acquired loan portfolios. Level 3 inputs are utilized to value the portfolio and include the use of present value techniques employing cash flow estimates and incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in estimating fair values. Specifically, management utilizes three separate fair value analyses which a market participant would employ in estimating the total fair value adjustment, which are: 1) interest rate loan fair value analysis; 2) general credit fair value analysis; and 3) specific credit fair value analysis. For loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration, the Corporation prepares a specific credit fair value adjustment. Actual performance of loans could differ from management's initial estimates. If a loan outperforms the original fair value estimate, the difference between the original estimate and the actual performance of the loan is accreted into net interest income. Therefore, the net interest margin may initially increase due to the discount accretion. The yields on acquired loans are expected to decline as the acquired loan portfolio pays down or matures and the discount decreases. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest rate margins and lower interest income in future periods. For more information, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under Item 8.\nValuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets, while the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The most significant other intangible asset is the core deposit intangible (CDI). In order to initially record the fair value of the CDI, the income approach is used. Estimates are based upon financial, economic, market and other conditions that exist at the time of the acquisition to develop the projected market interest rate, future interest and maintenance costs, and attrition rates. Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of the benefit of the asset or liability, the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset or liability, including the historical cash flows.\nReaders of the Corporation's financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the Corporation's current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances, business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the Corporation at that time.\nGeneral\nThe Corporation earns revenues primarily from the margins and fees generated from the lending and depository services to customers as well as fee-based income from trust, insurance, mortgage banking and investment services to customers. The Corporation seeks to achieve adequate and reliable earnings through business growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk to Board of Directors approved levels. Growth is pursued through expansion of current customer relationships and development of additional relationships with new offices and strategic acquisitions.\nThe principal component of earnings for the Corporation is net interest income, the income earned on loans and investments less the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin, the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, is impacted by several factors including market interest rates, economic conditions, loan and lease demand, and deposit activity. As interest rates increase, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to decrease in value; conversely, as interest rates decline, fixed-rate assets that banks hold will tend to increase in value. The Corporation is in a slightly asset sensitive position and net interest income is projected to increase in a rising rate environment, however, actual results could be materially different than modeled, due to numerous factors influencing interest rates earned on new loans and investments as well as rates paid on new and existing deposits and new borrowings.\n 21 \nExecutive Overview\nThe Corporation's consolidated net income, earnings per share and return on average assets and average equity were as follows:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 to 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets\n</td> <td>1.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6 BP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45 BP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average equity\n</td> <td>8.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11 BP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391 BP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 versus 2017\nThe Corporation reported net income of $50.5 million, or $1.72 diluted earnings per share, for 2018 compared to net income of $44.1 million, or $1.64 diluted earnings per share for 2017.
