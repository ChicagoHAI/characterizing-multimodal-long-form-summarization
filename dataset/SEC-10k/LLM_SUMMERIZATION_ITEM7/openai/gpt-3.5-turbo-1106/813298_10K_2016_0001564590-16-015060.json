Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nAs noted above, this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, this Item 7, contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of numerous factors, including, without limitation those risks and uncertainties set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors which you are encouraged to read. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in light of those risks and uncertainties and in conjunction with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.\nCertain figures discussed below may not add due to rounding.\nSegment Reporting\nWe report our operations as one reportable segment, Big & Tall Men's Apparel. We consider our retail and direct business, especially in our growing omni-channel environment, to be similar in terms of economic characteristics, production processes and operations, and have therefore aggregated them into a single reporting segment.\nComparable Sales Definition\nTotal comparable sales include our retail stores that have been open for at least 13 months and our direct business. Stores that have been remodeled or re-located during the period are also included in our determination of comparable sales. Stores that have been expanded by more than 25% are considered non-comparable for the first 13 months. If a store becomes a clearance center, it is also removed from the calculation of comparable sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and, as a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other retailers.\nOur customer's shopping experience continues to evolve across multiple channels and we are continually changing to meet his needs. As part of our omni-channel initiatives, beginning in fiscal 2014 the majority of our retail stores have the capability of fulfilling online orders if merchandise is not available in the warehouse. As a result, we continue to see more transactions that begin online but are ultimately completed at the store level. Similarly, if a customer visits a store and the item is out of stock, the associate can order the item through our website. A customer also has the ability to order online and pick-up in store. Because this omni-channel approach to retailing is changing the boundaries of where a sale originates and where a sale is ultimately settled, we no longer report comparable sales separately for our retail and direct businesses. We anticipate that we will continue to provide specific information on our DXL comparable store sales in the near-term, but as we near completion of our roll-out we expect to transition to one comparable sales figure for the Company.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe monitor certain non-GAAP financial measures on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business. These measures include adjusted loss from continuing operations, adjusted loss from continuing operations per diluted share, adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per diluted share, free cash flow and EBITDA from continuing operations (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and discontinued operations). We believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to the Company's operating performance and cash flows. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures is important to assist investors in comparing fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, on a comparable basis. However, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for operating loss, loss from continuing operations, net loss per diluted share or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d below for the definition of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n2015 Financial Summary\nWe are very pleased with our financial performance for fiscal 2015. In almost all areas, we met or exceeded our expectations for the year. For the retail apparel industry, as a whole, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was difficult because of the unseasonably warm weather affecting much of the United States. However, while our sales at the onset of the fourth quarter were slower than we had anticipated, the last two months of the quarter were very strong with our 137 comparable DXL stores delivering an 8.9% sales increase for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. For the full year, the DXL stores had a comparable sales increase of 9.7%, against the prior year's comparable sales increase of 13.7%. Furthermore, our merchandise margin for the full year increased 40 basis points over the prior year, as a result of a strong initial margin, controlled promotional activities and reduced markdowns.\nEBITDA for fiscal 2015 was $23.3 million as compared to $15.2 million in fiscal 2014. Due to the intensive capital requirements associated with our DXL conversion strategy, depreciation costs have increased sharply over the past 3 years. As a result, EBITDA is a key performance indicator as to how well our strategy is working.\nOur improved performance is attributable to our DXL concept, where sales per square foot increased to $177 for fiscal 2015 as compared to $165 for fiscal 2014. Overall, we are converting our traffic into top-line growth, with the total number of transactions up 6.2% and dollars spent per transaction up 3.3% for fiscal 2015. A significant contributor to that growth has been our end-of-rack\u201d customer. We define end-of-rack\u201d customer as any customer with a waist size 46 inches or less. The end-of-rack customer is very important to us as he represents our most significant customer growth opportunity. The end-of-rack customer shops 41% more often and, on an annual basis, spends two times that of our larger-waist customer. For fiscal 2015, our end-of-rack customer represented 43.6% of our sales in bottoms, compared with 41.0% for fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we opened 29 DXL retail stores, of which 14 of the stores were less than 6,500 square feet. These smaller footprint DXL stores have allowed us the ability to enter markets that otherwise could not support the larger store size, while also helping to reduce our capital costs and improve free cash flow. We also opened 7 DXL outlet stores during fiscal 2015.\nFrom an omni-channel perspective, we continue to see a significant benefit from the implementation of software in fiscal 2014, which made our inventory at the store level visible to our e-commerce customer. For fiscal 2015, the traffic to our website increased 15% over the prior year and, depending on product availability, increased demand can now be fulfilled at the store level. Another benefit we saw from our inventory being visible across all channels is that levels of clearance merchandise continued to decrease, representing only 8.1% of our inventory at January 30, 2016 as compared to 8.4% at January 31, 2015.\nFor fiscal 2015, we reported a net loss of $8.4 million, or $(0.17) per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $12.3 million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, in fiscal 2014. The comparability of our operating results year-to-year is primarily affected by our income tax provision (benefit), as a result of our valuation allowance established in fiscal 2013 against our deferred tax assets. Adjusting for a normal tax rate of 40.0% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted net loss for fiscal 2015 was $4.9 million, or $(0.10) per diluted share, as compared to an adjusted net loss of $7.7 million, or $(0.16) per diluted share. Included in the adjusted net loss for fiscal 2014 is a loss from discontinued operations of $(0.02) per share.

The increase of $28.2 million in sales was primarily due to a comparable sales increase of 4.8%, or $18.0 million. Increase in our non-comparable sales, primarily from our DXL stores that have been opened less than 13 months, of $44.2 million and other revenue of $0.6 million were partially offset by a reduction of $34.6 million in lost sales from closed and converted stores.\nComparable sales from our 137 DXL retail stores increased 9.7%, or $16.0 million in fiscal 2015, against a 13.7% comparable sales increase in fiscal 2014. The total number of transactions for these comparable stores increased 6.2% and dollars per transactions increased 3.3% over fiscal 2014. These metrics are a strong indicator that we are successfully converting our traffic into top-line sales. In addition, we continue to grow our end of rack\u201d customer base. For fiscal 2015, those customers, with waist sizes 46\u201d or less, represented 43.6% of our bottoms business as compared to 41.0% in fiscal 2014. Sales per square foot from our DXL stores increased to $177 in fiscal 2015 from $165 in fiscal 2014 and $150 in fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2015, 40 DXL stores are already producing over $200 per square foot in sales.\nAs mentioned above, although sales in the beginning of the fourth quarter were softer than expected due to the unseasonably warm weather, our sales for the last two months of the quarter, especially in our DXL stores, were very strong. While our Casual Male XL retail and outlet stores performed well in fiscal 2015, our Rochester Clothing stores were negatively impacted by the lack of international tourism and overall decrease in demand for luxury apparel.\nFiscal 2014 sales increased 7.1% to $414.0 million as compared to $386.5 million for fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to a comparable sales increase of 6.4%, or $20.8 million, an increase in our non-comparable sales of $62.1 million and other net revenue of $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by $55.9 million in sales from our closed Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores. The year-over-year comparable sales increase of 6.4% was driven by a comparable sales increase from our 93 comparable DXL stores of 13.7%. Of significance, the number of customer transactions was up 13.3% over the prior year.\nOur decision in fiscal 2014 to keep our Casual Male XL stores open until after a DXL store opens has also had a positive impact to sales in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. By remaining open, our Casual Male XL stores have been able to market the new DXL store and direct our customer to shop there. While the majority of the sales growth has been from our DXL stores, our Casual Male XL stores have also contributed to our comparable sales increase.\nGROSS MARGIN\nGross margin rate for fiscal 2015 was 46.1% as compared to 45.9% in fiscal 2014 and 45.6% for fiscal 2013.\nIncluded in the gross margin for fiscal 2014 was a $2.5 million payment we received to exit our San Francisco store prior to the end of its lease term. This payment favorably benefited the prior year's gross margin by 60 basis points. Excluding the impact of that lease termination, occupancy costs for fiscal 2015 improved 40 basis points over the prior year, primarily due to the growing sales base as well as the decrease in the average size of our DXL stores. Merchandise margins for fiscal 2015 increased 40 basis points as a result of strong initial margins, a lower markdown rate and less promotional activities.\nThe gross margin increase of 30 basis points for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was driven by a decrease of 130 basis points in occupancy costs partially offset by a decrease in merchandise margins of 100 basis points. The 130 basis point improvement in occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to the early San Francisco lease termination payment which represented 60 basis points of this improvement. Occupancy costs also included DXL transition costs related to preopening rent and landlord terminations of $2.8 million in fiscal 2014 and $4.3 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in our merchandise margin of 100 basis points was mainly due to higher markdown activity associated with our marketing initiatives and promotional activities.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 40.8%, 42.2% and 43.7%, respectively.\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $5.8 million, or 3.3%, to $180.6 million as compared to $174.8 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in SG&A expenses of $5.8 million is due to increased store payroll and other supporting store costs of approximately $5.9 million, associated with the higher sales base, an increase in incentive accruals of $1.4 million, associated with the Company's long-term incentive plans, and other corporate and supporting costs of $0.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in marketing expenses of $2.4 million.\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2014 increased $5.7 million, or 3.4%, to $174.8 million as compared to SG&A expenses of $169.1 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in SG&A expenses of $5.7 million was principally due to a greater number of DXL stores open in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and, to a lesser extent, was due to increased store payroll to support the return to standard hours in our Casual Male XL stores. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in incentive accruals and stock compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs as compared to fiscal 2013.\nSG&A expenses included approximately $3.8 million, $4.0 million and $5.3 million of DXL transition costs for increased payroll-related costs, such as pre-opening payroll, training and store operations for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $28.4 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to $24.0 million for fiscal 2014 and $20.8 million for fiscal 2013. The year-over-year increases in depreciation and amortization expense for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 are primarily related to the opening of 119 DXL stores since the end of fiscal 2012. Included in depreciation and amortization is the amortization of our Casual Male\u201d trademark of $0.5 million, $1.0 million and $1.6 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET\nNet interest expense for fiscal 2015 was $3.1 million as compared to $2.1 million for fiscal 2014 and $1.0 million for fiscal 2013. Our interest costs have increased year-over-year primarily due to the increased borrowings under our credit facility incurred to finance our DXL store openings.\nWe have funded a portion of our store growth with equipment financings of $26.4 million, a $15.0 million term loan and borrowings under our credit facility. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for more discussion regarding our credit facility, equipment financings and term loan as well as our future liquidity needs.\nINCOME TAXES\nPursuant to accounting rules, realization of our deferred tax assets, which relate principally to federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring from 2022 through 2035, is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the near term.\nAt the end of fiscal 2013, we entered a three-year cumulative loss and based on all positive and negative evidence at February 1, 2014, we recorded a charge of $51.3 million to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Based on our results for fiscal 2015 and our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016, we believe that a full valuation allowance remains appropriate at this time.\nOur tax provision for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 represents an increase in our deferred tax liability for indefinite-lived intangibles as well as current state margin tax and foreign income tax.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nDuring fiscal 2014, we exited our direct business with Sears Canada. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2014 included a charge of approximately $0.8 million related primarily to inventory reserves and sales allowances as a result of our decision to exit the business. See Note J to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure regarding discontinued operations.\nNET LOSS\nThe net loss for fiscal 2015 was $(8.4) million, or $(0.17) per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $(12.3) million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, in fiscal 2014 and $(59.8) million, or $(1.23) per diluted share, in fiscal 2013.\n(Certain amounts in the following table do not foot due to rounding)\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations, before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Provision for income taxes (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (60.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (59.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted net loss, on a non-GAAP basis (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss per diluted share (GAAP basis)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.17\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.25\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.23\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share\n(non-GAAP basis)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.16\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded a charge of $51.3 million to establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the net loss incurred in fiscal 2013, which resulted in a three-year cumulative loss position.

Our current cash needs are primarily for working capital (essentially inventory requirements), capital expenditures and growth initiatives. As discussed below, our capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $30.0 million, primarily related to the planned opening of approximately 31 new DXL retail and outlet stores and information technology projects. However, we expect to receive approximately $7.0-$8.0 million in tenant allowances to offset these capital expenditures. We expect to fund our store growth in fiscal 2016 primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings from our Credit Facility. We expect that our total debt at the end of fiscal 2016 will be approximately $64.0-$69.0 million.\nFor fiscal 2016, we expect to generate free cash flow before DXL capital expenditures (as defined above under Presentation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d) of $20.6 million to $25.6 million. We will reinvest that cash to fund our DXL store growth in fiscal 2016, which we believe provides the best opportunity for return on capital. After DXL capital expenditures, we expect positive free cash flow of breakeven to $5.0 million, and we expect that our total debt at the end of fiscal 2016 will be approximately $64.0-$69.0 million.\nThe following table sets forth financial data regarding our liquidity position at the end of the past three fiscal years:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions, except ratios)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused excess availability under Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Beginning in fiscal 2015, unamortized debt issuance costs are reflected as a deduction from the corresponding debt.

This improvement in free cash flow was due to an improvement of $4.6 million in cash flow from operations and a $7.5 million decrease in capital expenditures related to an overall decrease in the square footage of new DXL stores.\nThe following is a summary of our total debt outstanding at January 30, 2016, with the associated unamortized debt issuance costs:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Gross Debt\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Debt Issuance\nCosts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Debt\nOutstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (462\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment financing notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term loan, due 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (955\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facility\nOur Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. provides for a maximum committed borrowing of $125.0 million, which, pursuant to an accordion feature, may be increased to $175 million upon our request and the agreement of the lender(s) participating in the increase. The Credit Facility includes a sublimit of $20.0 million for commercial and standby letters of credit and a sublimit of up to $15.0 million for swingline loans. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is October 29, 2019. Our Credit Facility is described in more detail in Note C to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBorrowings made pursuant to the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the base rate (determined as the highest of (a) Bank of America N.A.'s prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the annual ICE-LIBOR ( LIBOR\u201d) rate for the respective interest period) plus a varying percentage, based on our borrowing base, of 0.50%-0.75% for prime-based borrowings and 1.50%-1.75% for LIBOR-based borrowings.\nWe had outstanding borrowings of $42.4 million under the Credit Facility at January 30, 2016. Outstanding standby letters of credit were $2.5 million and outstanding documentary letters of credit were $0.7 million. The average monthly borrowing outstanding under the Credit Facility during fiscal 2015 was approximately $42.6 million, resulting in an average unused excess availability of approximately $66.7 million. Unused excess availability at January 30, 2016 was $66.0 million. Our obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets, excluding (i) a first priority lien held by the lenders of the Term Loan Facility described below on certain equipment of the Company and (ii) intellectual property.\nEquipment Financing Loans\nWe have entered into twelve Equipment Security Notes (the Notes\u201d), whereby we borrowed an aggregate of $26.4 million. The Notes, which were issued between September 2013 and June 2014, were issued pursuant to a Mater Loan and Security Agreement with Banc of America Leasing & Capital, LLC, dated July 20, 2007 and most recently amended September 30, 2013. The Notes are secured by a security interest in all of our rights, title and interest in and to certain equipment. The Notes are for 48 months and accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from 3.07% to 3.50%. Principal and interest, in arrears, are payable monthly. We are subject to a prepayment penalty equal to 1% of the prepaid principal of the Notes until the first anniversary, 0.5% of the prepaid principal from the first anniversary until the second anniversary and no prepayment penalty thereafter.\nTerm Loan, Due 2019\nWe have a $15.0 million senior secured term loan facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative and collateral agent (the Term Loan Facility\u201d). The Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) 1.00% and (b) the one month LIBOR rate, plus 6.50%. Interest payments are payable on the first business day of each calendar month, and increase by 2% following the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default,\u201d as defined in the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility, which matures October 29, 2019, provides for quarterly principal payments on the first business day of each calendar quarter, which commenced the first business day of January 2015, in an aggregate principal amount equal to $250,000, subject to adjustment, with the balance payable on the termination date.\nThe Term Loan Facility includes usual and customary mandatory prepayment provisions for transactions of this type that are triggered by the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the amounts advanced under the Term Loan Facility can be optionally prepaid in whole or part. All prepayments are subject to an early termination fee in the amount of: (a) 4% of the amount prepaid if the prepayment is prior to October 29, 2015; (b) 2% of the amount prepaid if the prepayment is after October 29, 2015, but prior to the October 29, 2016; and (c) 1% of the amount prepaid if the prepayment is after October 29, 2016, but prior to October 29, 2017. There is no prepayment penalty after October 29, 2017.\nIt is secured by a first priority lien on certain of our equipment, and a second priority lien on substantially all of our remaining assets, excluding intellectual property.\nINVENTORY\nAt January 30, 2016, total inventories increased to $125.0 million from $115.2 million at January 31, 2015. The reasons for the $9.8 million increase in inventory are due to the increase in total store square footage as well as our concerted effort to accelerate year-end merchandise receipts, allowing additional time for spring store fulfillment. At January 30, 2016, our clearance inventory represented 8.1% of our total inventory, as compared to 8.4% at January 31, 2015.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 30, 2016, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (Certain amounts in the following table do not foot due to rounding):\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 322.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-merchandise Purchase Obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merchandise Purchase Obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Commitments (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 386.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 120.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes amounts due on our lease agreement for our corporate headquarters and distribution center and operating leases for all of our current store locations and certain equipment and auto leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Includes principal payments on our outstanding secured notes and the corresponding estimated interest costs.

Approximately $20.1 million related to the opening of 29 DXL stores, 7 DXL outlets and some costs for DXL stores that are currently under construction that will open in fiscal 2016. In addition, we spent approximately $8.1 million in management information projects, which included continued enhancements for our e-commerce site, upgrades to our corporate systems and hardware for our DXL stores, with the remainder for general capital projects in our distribution center and corporate offices.\nFor fiscal 2016, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $30.0 million and we expect to receive approximately $7.0-$8.0 million in tenant allowances to offset these expenditures. Our budget includes approximately $20.6 million, excluding any allowance, related to the opening of 28 DXL retail stores and 3 DXL outlet stores, and approximately $5.9 million for continued information technology projects. The remainder of the budget is for general overhead projects and improving our distribution center. In addition, we expect to close approximately 26 Casual Male XL stores and 3 Casual Male XL outlet stores, the majority of which are in connection with the opening of the DXL retail and outlet stores in the same geographic market.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES; USE OF ESTIMATES\nOur financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies, many of which require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions (see Note A to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We believe that the following items involve some of the more critical judgments in the application of accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (the expected term\u201d), the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements ( forfeitures\u201d). Changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related amount recognized as an expense on the consolidated statements of operations. As required under the accounting rules, we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock-based awards granted in future periods. The values derived from using the Black-Scholes model are recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from these current estimates. For performance-based awards, no compensation expense is recognized until the performance targets are deemed probable. At January 30, 2016, we have not recognized any expense on our outstanding performance-based awards under the Company's 2013-2016 LTIP because the performance targets are not deemed probable. For fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized total compensation expense of $2.2 million, $3.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.\nLong-Term Incentive Plan\nOur 2016 Long-Term Incentive Wrap-Around Plan is a dollar-denominated performance-based incentive plan that is only effective if there is no vesting of the performance-based awards under the 2013-2016 LTIP, discussed above under Stock-Based Compensation. Any award earned under this plan will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of restricted stock. The plan also provides for an opportunity to receive additional shares of restricted stock if the performance targets are achieved and the Company's closing stock is $6.75 or higher on the day earnings for fiscal 2016 are publicly released. Our Company's performance against the performance targets are reviewed on a quarterly basis throughout the applicable performance period to assess whether an accrual is needed. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we accrued approximately $1.4 million for our probable level of payout, on a pro-rata basis, of the performance targets under this plan. On a quarterly basis, we will update the accrual as needed, based on the updated probability of achieving the performance targets. No awards will be granted, however, until such performance targets are achieved and the Company's Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves such grants. See Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Wrap-Around Plan.\nInventory\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or market, using a weighted-average cost method. We review our inventory to identify slow-moving and broken assortments. We use markdowns to clear merchandise and will record inventory reserves if the estimated future selling price is less than cost. In addition, an inventory shrink estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen merchandise. We perform physical inventories throughout the year and adjust the shrink reserves accordingly.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by those assets is less than the assets' carrying amount. We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment at a store level for all our retail locations. If actual market conditions are less favorable than management's projections, future write-offs may be necessary.\nFor fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, to write-down property and equipment. The impairments related to stores with carrying values which exceeded fair value. There was no material impairment charge for long-lived assets in fiscal 2015.\nIntangibles\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, we evaluate our intangible assets with indefinite-lives at least annually for impairment by analyzing the estimated fair value.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we performed our annual testing of our Rochester\u201d trademark for potential impairment. Utilizing an income approach with appropriate royalty rates applied, we concluded that the Rochester\u201d trademark, with a carrying value of $1.5 million, was not impaired.\nBased on the expected closure of our Casual Male XL retail stores, at January 28, 2012, our Casual Male\u201d trademark was reclassified as a definite-lived asset. The trademark is being amortized, on an accelerated basis, through fiscal 2018, its estimated useful life. At January 30, 2016, the carrying value of the Casual Male\u201d trademark was $0.9 million.\nDeferred Taxes\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, on a quarterly basis, we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and, if needed, establish a valuation allowance against those assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into a three-year cumulative loss position and based on forecasts at that time, we expected the cumulative three-year loss to increase as of the end of fiscal 2014. Management determined that this represented significant negative evidence at February 1, 2014. While we have projected that the Company will return to profitability, generate taxable income and ultimately emerge from a three-year cumulative loss, based on a consideration of all positive and negative evidence as of February 1, 2014, we established a full allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Based on actual results for fiscal 2015 and our forecast for fiscal 2016, we believe that a full allowance remains appropriate at this time.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWe have reviewed accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effective dates during the periods reported and in future periods. We believe that the following impending standards may have an impact on our future filings. The applicability of any standard will be evaluated by us and is still subject to our review.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d as well as various other sections of the ASC, such as, but not limited to, ASC 340-20, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Capitalized Advertising Costs\u201d. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that would result in an entity providing users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity's contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and is to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial adoption as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets on the balance sheet). Early adoption is permitted after December 15, 2016. We do not believe that there will be any material impact of ASU 2014-09 on our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period\u201d. ASU 2014-12 affects entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period, with earlier adoption permitted. We do not believe that there will be any material impact of ASU 2014-12 on our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)\u201d. ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP, which requires an entity to separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. ASU 2015-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal - Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\u201d. ASU 2015-05 provides accounting guidance on how customers should treat cloud computing arrangements. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those reporting periods. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either (1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or (2) retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-05 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\" which applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") or average cost. Under the updated guidance, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This is a change from previous measurement of lower of cost or market, where market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on our financial position but do not expect that there will be any material impact of ASU 2015-11 on our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805),\u201d which simplified the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. The guidance requires a company to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified in the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Any effect on earnings or changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, as a result of the change in provisional amounts, will be recorded as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The portion of the amount that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized will be separately presented on the face of the income statement or disclosed in the notes. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2015, and should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on our financial position but do not expect that there will be any material impact of ASU 2015-16 on our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which will require an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and will increase disclosure requirements on its leasing arrangements. The guidance requires a lessee to recognize in its statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and the right-of-use asset presenting its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term (the lease asset). When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, a lessee (and a lessor) will include payments to be made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. Similarly, optional payments to purchase the underlying asset will be included in the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that purchase option. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. In the financial statements in which the ASU is first applied, leases shall be measured and recognized at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented with an adjustment to equity. Practical expedients are available for election as a package and if applied consistently to all leases. We are currently evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nAlthough our operations are influenced by general economic trends, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of our operations in the last three fiscal years.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial performance and operations of a company in the retail apparel industry, primarily focusing on its Big & Tall Men's Apparel segment.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nAs noted above, this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, this Item 7, contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of numerous factors, including, without limitation those risks and uncertainties set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors which you are encouraged to read. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in light of those risks and uncertainties and in conjunction with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.\nCertain figures discussed below may not add due to rounding.\nSegment Reporting\nWe report our operations as one reportable segment, Big & Tall Men's Apparel. We consider our retail and direct business, especially in our growing omni-channel environment, to be similar in terms of economic characteristics, production processes and operations, and have therefore aggregated them into a single reporting segment.\nComparable Sales Definition\nTotal comparable sales include our retail stores that have been open for at least 13 months and our direct business. Stores that have been remodeled or re-located during the period are also included in our determination of comparable sales. Stores that have been expanded by more than 25% are considered non-comparable for the first 13 months. If a store becomes a clearance center, it is also removed from the calculation of comparable sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and, as a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other retailers.\nOur customer's shopping experience continues to evolve across multiple channels and we are continually changing to meet his needs. As part of our omni-channel initiatives, beginning in fiscal 2014 the majority of our retail stores have the capability of fulfilling online orders if merchandise is not available in the warehouse. As a result, we continue to see more transactions that begin online but are ultimately completed at the store level. Similarly, if a customer visits a store and the item is out of stock, the associate can order the item through our website. A customer also has the ability to order online and pick-up in store. Because this omni-channel approach to retailing is changing the boundaries of where a sale originates and where a sale is ultimately settled, we no longer report comparable sales separately for our retail and direct businesses. We anticipate that we will continue to provide specific information on our DXL comparable store sales in the near-term, but as we near completion of our roll-out we expect to transition to one comparable sales figure for the Company.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe monitor certain non-GAAP financial measures on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business. These measures include adjusted loss from continuing operations, adjusted loss from continuing operations per diluted share, adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per diluted share, free cash flow and EBITDA from continuing operations (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and discontinued operations). We believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to the Company's operating performance and cash flows. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures is important to assist investors in comparing fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, on a comparable basis. However, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for operating loss, loss from continuing operations, net loss per diluted share or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d below for the definition of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n2015 Financial Summary\nWe are very pleased with our financial performance for fiscal 2015. In almost all areas, we met or exceeded our expectations for the year. For the retail apparel industry, as a whole, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was difficult because of the unseasonably warm weather affecting much of the United States. However, while our sales at the onset of the fourth quarter were slower than we had anticipated, the last two months of the quarter were very strong with our 137 comparable DXL stores delivering an 8.9% sales increase for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. For the full year, the DXL stores had a comparable sales increase of 9.7%, against the prior year's comparable sales increase of 13.7%. Furthermore, our merchandise margin for the full year increased 40 basis points over the prior year, as a result of a strong initial margin, controlled promotional activities and reduced markdowns.\nEBITDA for fiscal 2015 was $23.3 million as compared to $15.2 million in fiscal 2014. Due to the intensive capital requirements associated with our DXL conversion strategy, depreciation costs have increased sharply over the past 3 years. As a result, EBITDA is a key performance indicator as to how well our strategy is working.\nOur improved performance is attributable to our DXL concept, where sales per square foot increased to $177 for fiscal 2015 as compared to $165 for fiscal 2014. Overall, we are converting our traffic into top-line growth, with the total number of transactions up 6.2% and dollars spent per transaction up 3.3% for fiscal 2015. A significant contributor to that growth has been our end-of-rack\u201d customer. We define end-of-rack\u201d customer as any customer with a waist size 46 inches or less. The end-of-rack customer is very important to us as he represents our most significant customer growth opportunity. The end-of-rack customer shops 41% more often and, on an annual basis, spends two times that of our larger-waist customer. For fiscal 2015, our end-of-rack customer represented 43.6% of our sales in bottoms, compared with 41.0% for fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we opened 29 DXL retail stores, of which 14 of the stores were less than 6,500 square feet. These smaller footprint DXL stores have allowed us the ability to enter markets that otherwise could not support the larger store size, while also helping to reduce our capital costs and improve free cash flow. We also opened 7 DXL outlet stores during fiscal 2015.\nFrom an omni-channel perspective, we continue to see a significant benefit from the implementation of software in fiscal 2014, which made our inventory at the store level visible to our e-commerce customer. For fiscal 2015, the traffic to our website increased 15% over the prior year and, depending on product availability, increased demand can now be fulfilled at the store level. Another benefit we saw from our inventory being visible across all channels is that levels of clearance merchandise continued to decrease, representing only 8.1% of our inventory at January 30, 2016 as compared to 8.4% at January 31, 2015.\nFor fiscal 2015, we reported a net loss of $8.4 million, or $(0.17) per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $12.3 million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, in fiscal 2014. The comparability of our operating results year-to-year is primarily affected by our income tax provision (benefit), as a result of our valuation allowance established in fiscal 2013 against our deferred tax assets. Adjusting for a normal tax rate of 40.0% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted net loss for fiscal 2015 was $4.9 million, or $(0.10) per diluted share, as compared to an adjusted net loss of $7.7 million, or $(0.16) per diluted share. Included in the adjusted net loss for fiscal 2014 is a loss from discontinued operations of $(0.02) per share. The following table is a summary EBITDA from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for each fiscal year (Certain amounts in the following table do not foot due to rounding):\n \n\n (1) All fiscal years have been adjusted to affect a normal tax rate of approximately 40.0%. Fiscal 2013 has also been adjusted to exclude charges for executive severance and asset impairment. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\u201d \nFiscal 2016 Outlook\nWe anticipate our store growth for fiscal 2016 will be very similar to fiscal 2015, with plans to open 28 DXL retail stores and 3 DXL outlet stores while closing approximately 26 Casual Male XL retail stores and 3 Casual Male XL outlet stores. A complete discussion of this business strategy and our long-term projections is also discussed above under Item 1. Business - Business Strategy.\u201d\nFor fiscal 2016, our earnings guidance is as follows:\n \u00b7 Sales are expected to range from $465.0 million to $472.0 million, with a total company comparable sales increase of approximately 4.8% to 5.5%. \n \u00b7 Gross margin rate of 46.2% to 46.5%, an increase of 10 to 40 basis points from fiscal 2015. \n \u00b7 EBITDA of $31.0 to $35.0 million, an increase of $7.7-$11.7 million as compared to fiscal 2015. \n \u00b7 Earnings, on a GAAP basis, of breakeven to a net loss of $(0.09) per diluted share. \n \u00b7 Net loss, on a non-GAAP basis, of breakeven to $(0.05) per diluted share. Because we expect to continue providing a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, we will not recognize any income tax benefit in fiscal 2016. This non-GAAP net loss was calculated, assuming a normal tax benefit of approximately 40%, by taking the 2016 forecasted earnings of breakeven to a net loss of $(0.09) and multiplying each by 40% to calculate an estimated income tax provision (benefit) of $0.00-$(0.04) per diluted share, resulting in an adjusted non-GAAP earnings of breakeven to a net loss of $(0.05) per diluted share. \n \u00b7 Capital expenditures of approximately $30.0 million, which are primarily related to opening our DXL stores, will be partially offset by approximately $7.0-$8.0 million in tenant allowances. We expect to fund our capital expenditures primarily from our operating cash flow. \n \u00b7 At the end of fiscal 2016, we expect to have total debt of approximately $64.0-$69.0 million, consisting of $12.8 million outstanding from a term loan, $6.6 million outstanding from equipment financing notes with the balance from our credit facility. From a liquidity perspective, we expect cash flow from operating activities of $30.0 million to $35.0 million (including tenant allowances), resulting in positive free cash flow, before DXL capital expenditures, of approximately $20.6 million to $25.6 million. Free cash flow (as defined below under Presentation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d) will be approximately breakeven to $5.0 million. \nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nAdjusted Loss From Continuing Operations and Adjusted Net Loss Per Diluted Share\nThe following table is a reconciliation of loss from continuing operations and net loss (both on a GAAP-basis) to adjusted loss from continuing operations and adjusted net loss (both on a non-GAAP basis). (Certain amounts do not foot due to rounding):\n\n (1) The income tax benefit for fiscal 2013 results in an effective tax rate of 38.2%, after the add-back for the incremental charge of $51.3 million for the establishment of a full valuation allowance. \nFree Cash Flow\nWe calculate free cash flow as cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. However, we believe free cash flow before DXL capital expenditures is another important metric because it demonstrates our ability to strengthen liquidity while also contributing to the funding of our DXL store growth. In 2016, we are projecting that all of our capital expenditures for DXL stores will be funded by free cash flow. Free cash flow excludes the mandatory and discretionary repayment of debt. The following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow, with our capital expenditures for our DXL stores separately reported from our other capital projects:\n\n (1) Cash flow from operating activities includes lease incentives received against our capital expenditures. Projected cash flow from operating activities for fiscal 2016 includes an estimated $7.0-$8.0 million in lease incentives. \nEBITDA from Continuing Operations\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net loss on a GAAP basis to EBITDA from continuing operations, on a non-GAAP basis, for each fiscal year. (Certain amounts in the following table do not foot due to rounding):\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were all 52-week periods.\nSALES\n\nSales for fiscal 2015 increased 6.8% to $442.2 million as compared to $414.0 million in fiscal 2014. The increase of $28.2 million in sales was primarily due to a comparable sales increase of 4.8%, or $18.0 million. Increase in our non-comparable sales, primarily from our DXL stores that have been opened less than 13 months, of $44.2 million and other revenue of $0.6 million were partially offset by a reduction of $34.6 million in lost sales from closed and converted stores.\nComparable sales from our 137 DXL retail stores increased 9.7%, or $16.0 million in fiscal 2015, against a 13.7% comparable sales increase in fiscal 2014. The total number of transactions for these comparable stores increased 6.2% and dollars per transactions increased 3.3% over fiscal 2014. These metrics are a strong indicator that we are successfully converting our traffic into top-line sales. In addition, we continue to grow our end of rack\u201d customer base. For fiscal 2015, those customers, with waist sizes 46\u201d or less, represented 43.6% of our bottoms business as compared to 41.0% in fiscal 2014. Sales per square foot from our DXL stores increased to $177 in fiscal 2015 from $165 in fiscal 2014 and $150 in fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2015, 40 DXL stores are already producing over $200 per square foot in sales.\nAs mentioned above, although sales in the beginning of the fourth quarter were softer than expected due to the unseasonably warm weather, our sales for the last two months of the quarter, especially in our DXL stores, were very strong. While our Casual Male XL retail and outlet stores performed well in fiscal 2015, our Rochester Clothing stores were negatively impacted by the lack of international tourism and overall decrease in demand for luxury apparel.\nFiscal 2014 sales increased 7.1% to $414.0 million as compared to $386.5 million for fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to a comparable sales increase of 6.4%, or $20.8 million, an increase in our non-comparable sales of $62.1 million and other net revenue of $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by $55.9 million in sales from our closed Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores. The year-over-year comparable sales increase of 6.4% was driven by a comparable sales increase from our 93 comparable DXL stores of 13.7%. Of significance, the number of customer transactions was up 13.3% over the prior year.\nOur decision in fiscal 2014 to keep our Casual Male XL stores open until after a DXL store opens has also had a positive impact to sales in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. By remaining open, our Casual Male XL stores have been able to market the new DXL store and direct our customer to shop there. While the majority of the sales growth has been from our DXL stores, our Casual Male XL stores have also contributed to our comparable sales increase.\nGROSS MARGIN\nGross margin rate for fiscal 2015 was 46.1% as compared to 45.9% in fiscal 2014 and 45.6% for fiscal 2013.\nIncluded in the gross margin for fiscal 2014 was a $2.5 million payment we received to exit our San Francisco store prior to the end of its lease term. This payment favorably benefited the prior year's gross margin by 60 basis points. Excluding the impact of that lease termination, occupancy costs for fiscal 2015 improved 40 basis points over the prior year, primarily due to the growing sales base as well as the decrease in the average size of our DXL stores. Merchandise margins for fiscal 2015 increased 40 basis points as a result of strong initial margins, a lower markdown rate and less promotional activities.\nThe gross margin increase of 30 basis points for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was driven by a decrease of 130 basis points in occupancy costs partially offset by a decrease in merchandise margins of 100 basis points. The 130 basis point improvement in occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to the early San Francisco lease termination payment which represented 60 basis points of this improvement. Occupancy costs also included DXL transition costs related to preopening rent and landlord terminations of $2.8 million in fiscal 2014 and $4.3 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in our merchandise margin of 100 basis points was mainly due to higher markdown activity associated with our marketing initiatives and promotional activities.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 40.8%, 42.2% and 43.7%, respectively.\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $5.8 million, or 3.3%, to $180.6 million as compared to $174.8 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in SG&A expenses of $5.8 million is due to increased store payroll and other supporting store costs of approximately $5.9 million, associated with the higher sales base, an increase in incentive accruals of $1.4 million, associated with the Company's long-term incentive plans, and other corporate and supporting costs of $0.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in marketing expenses of $2.4 million.\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2014 increased $5.7 million, or 3.4%, to $174.8 million as compared to SG&A expenses of $169.1 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in SG&A expenses of $5.7 million was principally due to a greater number of DXL stores open in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and, to a lesser extent, was due to increased store payroll to support the return to standard hours in our Casual Male XL stores. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in incentive accruals and stock compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs as compared to fiscal 2013.\nSG&A expenses included approximately $3.8 million, $4.0 million and $5.3 million of DXL transition costs for increased payroll-related costs, such as pre-opening payroll, training and store operations for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $28.4 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to $24.0 million for fiscal 2014 and $20.8 million for fiscal 2013. The year-over-year increases in depreciation and amortization expense for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 are primarily related to the opening of 119 DXL stores since the end of fiscal 2012. Included in depreciation and amortization is the amortization of our Casual Male\u201d trademark of $0.5 million, $1.0 million and $1.6 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET\nNet interest expense for fiscal 2015 was $3.1 million as compared to $2.1 million for fiscal 2014 and $1.0 million for fiscal 2013. Our interest costs have increased year-over-year primarily due to the increased borrowings under our credit facility incurred to finance our DXL store openings.\nWe have funded a portion of our store growth with equipment financings of $26.4 million, a $15.0 million term loan and borrowings under our credit facility. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for more discussion regarding our credit facility, equipment financings and term loan as well as our future liquidity needs.\nINCOME TAXES\nPursuant to accounting rules, realization of our deferred tax assets, which relate principally to federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring from 2022 through 2035, is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the near term.\nAt the end of fiscal 2013, we entered a three-year cumulative loss and based on all positive and negative evidence at February 1, 2014, we recorded a charge of $51.3 million to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Based on our results for fiscal 2015 and our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016, we believe that a full valuation allowance remains appropriate at this time.\nOur tax provision for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 represents an increase in our deferred tax liability for indefinite-lived intangibles as well as current state margin tax and foreign income tax.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nDuring fiscal 2014, we exited our direct business with Sears Canada. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2014 included a charge of approximately $0.8 million related primarily to inventory reserves and sales allowances as a result of our decision to exit the business. See Note J to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure regarding discontinued operations.\nNET LOSS\nThe net loss for fiscal 2015 was $(8.4) million, or $(0.17) per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $(12.3) million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, in fiscal 2014 and $(59.8) million, or $(1.23) per diluted share, in fiscal 2013.\n(Certain amounts in the following table do not foot due to rounding)\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nAs noted above, this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, this Item 7, contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of numerous factors, including, without limitation those risks and uncertainties set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors which you are encouraged to read. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in light of those risks and uncertainties and in conjunction with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.\nCertain figures discussed below may not add due to rounding.\nSegment Reporting\nWe report our operations as one reportable segment, Big & Tall Men's Apparel. We consider our retail and direct business, especially in our growing omni-channel environment, to be similar in terms of economic characteristics, production processes and operations, and have therefore aggregated them into a single reporting segment.\nComparable Sales Definition\nTotal comparable sales include our retail stores that have been open for at least 13 months and our direct business. Stores that have been remodeled or re-located during the period are also included in our determination of comparable sales. Stores that have been expanded by more than 25% are considered non-comparable for the first 13 months. If a store becomes a clearance center, it is also removed from the calculation of comparable sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and, as a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other retailers.\nOur customer's shopping experience continues to evolve across multiple channels and we are continually changing to meet his needs. As part of our omni-channel initiatives, beginning in fiscal 2014 the majority of our retail stores have the capability of fulfilling online orders if merchandise is not available in the warehouse. As a result, we continue to see more transactions that begin online but are ultimately completed at the store level. Similarly, if a customer visits a store and the item is out of stock, the associate can order the item through our website. A customer also has the ability to order online and pick-up in store. Because this omni-channel approach to retailing is changing the boundaries of where a sale originates and where a sale is ultimately settled, we no longer report comparable sales separately for our retail and direct businesses. We anticipate that we will continue to provide specific information on our DXL comparable store sales in the near-term, but as we near completion of our roll-out we expect to transition to one comparable sales figure for the Company.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe monitor certain non-GAAP financial measures on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business. These measures include adjusted loss from continuing operations, adjusted loss from continuing operations per diluted share, adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per diluted share, free cash flow and EBITDA from continuing operations (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and discontinued operations). We believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to the Company's operating performance and cash flows. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures is important to assist investors in comparing fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, on a comparable basis. However, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for operating loss, loss from continuing operations, net loss per diluted share or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations\u201d below for the definition of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n2015 Financial Summary\nWe are very pleased with our financial performance for fiscal 2015. In almost all areas, we met or exceeded our expectations for the year. For the retail apparel industry, as a whole, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was difficult because of the unseasonably warm weather affecting much of the United States. However, while our sales at the onset of the fourth quarter were slower than we had anticipated, the last two months of the quarter were very strong with our 137 comparable DXL stores delivering an 8.9% sales increase for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. For the full year, the DXL stores had a comparable sales increase of 9.7%, against the prior year's comparable sales increase of 13.7%. Furthermore, our merchandise margin for the full year increased 40 basis points over the prior year, as a result of a strong initial margin, controlled promotional activities and reduced markdowns.\nEBITDA for fiscal 2015 was $23.3 million as compared to $15.2 million in fiscal 2014. Due to the intensive capital requirements associated with our DXL conversion strategy, depreciation costs have increased sharply over the past 3 years. As a result, EBITDA is a key performance indicator as to how well our strategy is working.\nOur improved performance is attributable to our DXL concept, where sales per square foot increased to $177 for fiscal 2015 as compared to $165 for fiscal 2014. Overall, we are converting our traffic into top-line growth, with the total number of transactions up 6.2% and dollars spent per transaction up 3.3% for fiscal 2015. A significant contributor to that growth has been our end-of-rack\u201d customer. We define end-of-rack\u201d customer as any customer with a waist size 46 inches or less. The end-of-rack customer is very important to us as he represents our most significant customer growth opportunity. The end-of-rack customer shops 41% more often and, on an annual basis, spends two times that of our larger-waist customer. For fiscal 2015, our end-of-rack customer represented 43.6% of our sales in bottoms, compared with 41.0% for fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we opened 29 DXL retail stores, of which 14 of the stores were less than 6,500 square feet. These smaller footprint DXL stores have allowed us the ability to enter markets that otherwise could not support the larger store size, while also helping to reduce our capital costs and improve free cash flow. We also opened 7 DXL outlet stores during fiscal 2015.\nFrom an omni-channel perspective, we continue to see a significant benefit from the implementation of software in fiscal 2014, which made our inventory at the store level visible to our e-commerce customer. For fiscal 2015, the traffic to our website increased 15% over the prior year and, depending on product availability, increased demand can now be fulfilled at the store level. Another benefit we saw from our inventory being visible across all channels is that levels of clearance merchandise continued to decrease, representing only 8.1% of our inventory at January 30, 2016 as compared to 8.4% at January 31, 2015.\nFor fiscal 2015, we reported a net loss of $8.4 million, or $(0.17) per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $12.3 million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, in fiscal 2014. The comparability of our operating results year-to-year is primarily affected by our income tax provision (benefit), as a result of our valuation allowance established in fiscal 2013 against our deferred tax assets. Adjusting for a normal tax rate of 40.0% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted net loss for fiscal 2015 was $4.9 million, or $(0.10) per diluted share, as compared to an adjusted net loss of $7.7 million, or $(0.16) per diluted share. Included in the adjusted net loss for fiscal 2014 is a loss from discontinued operations of $(0.02) per share.

See Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\u201d \nFiscal 2016 Outlook\nWe anticipate our store growth for fiscal 2016 will be very similar to fiscal 2015, with plans to open 28 DXL retail stores and 3 DXL outlet stores while closing approximately 26 Casual Male XL retail stores and 3 Casual Male XL outlet stores. A complete discussion of this business strategy and our long-term projections is also discussed above under Item 1. Business - Business Strategy.\u201d\nFor fiscal 2016, our earnings guidance is as follows:\n \u00b7 Sales are expected to range from $465.0 million to $472.0 million, with a total company comparable sales increase of approximately 4.8% to 5.5%. \n \u00b7 Gross margin rate of 46.2% to 46.5%, an increase of 10 to 40 basis points from fiscal 2015. \n \u00b7 EBITDA of $31.0 to $35.0 million, an increase of $7.7-$11.7 million as compared to fiscal 2015. \n \u00b7 Earnings, on a GAAP basis, of breakeven to a net loss of $(0.09) per diluted share. \n \u00b7 Net loss, on a non-GAAP basis, of breakeven to $(0.05) per diluted share. Because we expect to continue providing a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, we will not recognize any income tax benefit in fiscal 2016. This non-GAAP net loss was calculated, assuming a normal tax benefit of approximately 40%, by taking the 2016 forecasted earnings of breakeven to a net loss of $(0.09) and multiplying each by 40% to calculate an estimated income tax provision (benefit) of $0.00-$(0.04) per diluted share, resulting in an adjusted non-GAAP earnings of breakeven to a net loss of $(0.05) per diluted share. \n \u00b7 Capital expenditures of approximately $30.0 million, which are primarily related to opening our DXL stores, will be partially offset by approximately $7.0-$8.0 million in tenant allowances. We expect to fund our capital expenditures primarily from our operating cash flow. \n \u00b7 At the end of fiscal 2016, we expect to have total debt of approximately $64.0-$69.0 million, consisting of $12.8 million outstanding from a term loan, $6.6 million outstanding from equipment financing notes with the balance from our credit facility. From a liquidity perspective, we expect cash flow from operating activities of $30.0 million to $35.0 million (including tenant allowances), resulting in positive free cash flow, before DXL capital expenditures, of approximately $20.6 million to $25.6 million. Free cash flow (as defined below under Presentation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d) will be approximately breakeven to $5.0 million. \nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nAdjusted Loss From Continuing Operations and Adjusted Net Loss Per Diluted Share\nThe following table is a reconciliation of loss from continuing operations and net loss (both on a GAAP-basis) to adjusted loss from continuing operations and adjusted net loss (both on a non-GAAP basis).

However, we believe free cash flow before DXL capital expenditures is another important metric because it demonstrates our ability to strengthen liquidity while also contributing to the funding of our DXL store growth. In 2016, we are projecting that all of our capital expenditures for DXL stores will be funded by free cash flow. Free cash flow excludes the mandatory and discretionary repayment of debt. The following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow, with our capital expenditures for our DXL stores separately reported from our other capital projects:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Projected\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flow from operating activities (GAAP) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $30.0-$35.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures, infrastructure projects\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free Cash Flow before DXL capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $20.6-$25.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures for DXL stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20.6)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (15.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (27.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $0.0-$5.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Cash flow from operating activities includes lease incentives received against our capital expenditures.

The increase of $28.2 million in sales was primarily due to a comparable sales increase of 4.8%, or $18.0 million. Increase in our non-comparable sales, primarily from our DXL stores that have been opened less than 13 months, of $44.2 million and other revenue of $0.6 million were partially offset by a reduction of $34.6 million in lost sales from closed and converted stores.\nComparable sales from our 137 DXL retail stores increased 9.7%, or $16.0 million in fiscal 2015, against a 13.7% comparable sales increase in fiscal 2014. The total number of transactions for these comparable stores increased 6.2% and dollars per transactions increased 3.3% over fiscal 2014. These metrics are a strong indicator that we are successfully converting our traffic into top-line sales. In addition, we continue to grow our end of rack\u201d customer base. For fiscal 2015, those customers, with waist sizes 46\u201d or less, represented 43.6% of our bottoms business as compared to 41.0% in fiscal 2014. Sales per square foot from our DXL stores increased to $177 in fiscal 2015 from $165 in fiscal 2014 and $150 in fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2015, 40 DXL stores are already producing over $200 per square foot in sales.\nAs mentioned above, although sales in the beginning of the fourth quarter were softer than expected due to the unseasonably warm weather, our sales for the last two months of the quarter, especially in our DXL stores, were very strong. While our Casual Male XL retail and outlet stores performed well in fiscal 2015, our Rochester Clothing stores were negatively impacted by the lack of international tourism and overall decrease in demand for luxury apparel.\nFiscal 2014 sales increased 7.1% to $414.0 million as compared to $386.5 million for fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to a comparable sales increase of 6.4%, or $20.8 million, an increase in our non-comparable sales of $62.1 million and other net revenue of $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by $55.9 million in sales from our closed Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores. The year-over-year comparable sales increase of 6.4% was driven by a comparable sales increase from our 93 comparable DXL stores of 13.7%. Of significance, the number of customer transactions was up 13.3% over the prior year.\nOur decision in fiscal 2014 to keep our Casual Male XL stores open until after a DXL store opens has also had a positive impact to sales in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. By remaining open, our Casual Male XL stores have been able to market the new DXL store and direct our customer to shop there. While the majority of the sales growth has been from our DXL stores, our Casual Male XL stores have also contributed to our comparable sales increase.\nGROSS MARGIN\nGross margin rate for fiscal 2015 was 46.1% as compared to 45.9% in fiscal 2014 and 45.6% for fiscal 2013.\nIncluded in the gross margin for fiscal 2014 was a $2.5 million payment we received to exit our San Francisco store prior to the end of its lease term. This payment favorably benefited the prior year's gross margin by 60 basis points. Excluding the impact of that lease termination, occupancy costs for fiscal 2015 improved 40 basis points over the prior year, primarily due to the growing sales base as well as the decrease in the average size of our DXL stores. Merchandise margins for fiscal 2015 increased 40 basis points as a result of strong initial margins, a lower markdown rate and less promotional activities.\nThe gross margin increase of 30 basis points for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was driven by a decrease of 130 basis points in occupancy costs partially offset by a decrease in merchandise margins of 100 basis points. The 130 basis point improvement in occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to the early San Francisco lease termination payment which represented 60 basis points of this improvement. Occupancy costs also included DXL transition costs related to preopening rent and landlord terminations of $2.8 million in fiscal 2014 and $4.3 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in our merchandise margin of 100 basis points was mainly due to higher markdown activity associated with our marketing initiatives and promotional activities.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 40.8%, 42.2% and 43.7%, respectively.\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $5.8 million, or 3.3%, to $180.6 million as compared to $174.8 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in SG&A expenses of $5.8 million is due to increased store payroll and other supporting store costs of approximately $5.9 million, associated with the higher sales base, an increase in incentive accruals of $1.4 million, associated with the Company's long-term incentive plans, and other corporate and supporting costs of $0.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in marketing expenses of $2.4 million.\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2014 increased $5.7 million, or 3.4%, to $174.8 million as compared to SG&A expenses of $169.1 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in SG&A expenses of $5.7 million was principally due to a greater number of DXL stores open in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and, to a lesser extent, was due to increased store payroll to support the return to standard hours in our Casual Male XL stores. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in incentive accruals and stock compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in marketing costs as compared to fiscal 2013.\nSG&A expenses included approximately $3.8 million, $4.0 million and $5.3 million of DXL transition costs for increased payroll-related costs, such as pre-opening payroll, training and store operations for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $28.4 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to $24.0 million for fiscal 2014 and $20.8 million for fiscal 2013. The year-over-year increases in depreciation and amortization expense for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 are primarily related to the opening of 119 DXL stores since the end of fiscal 2012. Included in depreciation and amortization is the amortization of our Casual Male\u201d trademark of $0.5 million, $1.0 million and $1.6 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET\nNet interest expense for fiscal 2015 was $3.1 million as compared to $2.1 million for fiscal 2014 and $1.0 million for fiscal 2013. Our interest costs have increased year-over-year primarily due to the increased borrowings under our credit facility incurred to finance our DXL store openings.\nWe have funded a portion of our store growth with equipment financings of $26.4 million, a $15.0 million term loan and borrowings under our credit facility. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for more discussion regarding our credit facility, equipment financings and term loan as well as our future liquidity needs.\nINCOME TAXES\nPursuant to accounting rules, realization of our deferred tax assets, which relate principally to federal net operating loss carryforwards expiring from 2022 through 2035, is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the near term.\nAt the end of fiscal 2013, we entered a three-year cumulative loss and based on all positive and negative evidence at February 1, 2014, we recorded a charge of $51.3 million to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Based on our results for fiscal 2015 and our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016, we believe that a full valuation allowance remains appropriate at this time.\nOur tax provision for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 represents an increase in our deferred tax liability for indefinite-lived intangibles as well as current state margin tax and foreign income tax.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nDuring fiscal 2014, we exited our direct business with Sears Canada. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2014 included a charge of approximately $0.8 million related primarily to inventory reserves and sales allowances as a result of our decision to exit the business. See Note J to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure regarding discontinued operations.\nNET LOSS\nThe net loss for fiscal 2015 was $(8.4) million, or $(0.17) per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $(12.3) million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, in fiscal 2014 and $(59.8) million, or $(1.23) per diluted share, in fiscal 2013.\n(Certain amounts in the following table do not foot due to rounding)\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td>"}
