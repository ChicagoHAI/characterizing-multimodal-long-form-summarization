Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies, prospects and estimates regarding future MOB market performance. Additionally, such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as well as known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially and in adverse ways from those projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by the use of such terms as expect,\u201d project,\u201d may,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d would,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d continue,\u201d opinion,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d pro forma\u201d or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date this Annual Report is filed with the SEC. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, and we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nAny such forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are subject to unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, and are based on a number of assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately. To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual results, our ability to meet such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, provide dividends to stockholders and maintain the value of our real estate properties, may be significantly hindered. Factors that might impair our ability to meet such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors are included herein and other filings with the SEC.\nForward-looking statements express expectations of future events. All forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected. Due to these inherent uncertainties, our stockholders are urged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. In addition, we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to projections over time, except as required by law.\nThese risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Additional information concerning us and our business, including additional factors that could materially affect our financial results, is included herein and in our other filings with the SEC.\nExecutive Summary\nWe are the largest publicly-traded REIT focused on MOBs in the U.S. as measured by the GLA of our MOBs. We conduct substantially all of our operations through HTALP. We invest in MOBs that we believe will serve the future of healthcare delivery and MOBs that are primarily located on health system campuses, near university medical centers, or in core community outpatient locations. We also focus on our key markets that have certain demographic and macro-economic trends and where we can utilize our institutional full-service operating platform to generate strong tenant and health system relationships and operating cost efficiencies. Our primary objective is to maximize stockholder value with disciplined growth through strategic investments that provide an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders by consistently increasing our cash flow. In pursuing this objective, we: (i) seek internal growth through proactive asset management, leasing, building services and property management oversight; (ii) target accretive acquisitions and developments of MOBs in markets with attractive demographics that complement our existing portfolio; and (iii) actively manage our balance sheet to maintain flexibility with conservative leverage. Additionally, from time to time we consider, on an opportunistic basis, significant portfolio acquisitions that we believe fit our core business and could enhance our existing portfolio.\nSince 2006, we have invested $6.8 billion primarily in MOBs, development projects, land and other healthcare real estate assets consisting of approximately 23.2 million square feet of GLA throughout the U.S. Approximately 68% of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or adjacent to, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. Our portfolio is diversified geographically across 32 states, with no state having more than 20% of our total GLA as of December 31, 2018. We are concentrated in 20 to 25 key markets that are experiencing higher economic and demographic trends than other markets, on average, that we expect will drive demand for MOBs. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in nine of our top ten markets and approximately 93% of our portfolio, based on GLA, is located in the top 75 MSAs, with Dallas, Houston, Boston, Tampa and Atlanta being our largest markets by investment.\nCompany Highlights\nPortfolio Operating Performance\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018, total revenue increased 13.4%, or $82.4 million, to $696.4 million, compared to $614.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $217.6 million, compared to $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.02 per diluted share, or $213.5 million, compared to $0.34 per diluted share, or $63.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018, HTA's FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $335.6 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $1.53 per diluted share, or $284.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018, HTALP's FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $339.6 million, or $1.62 per diluted OP Unit, compared to $1.54 per diluted OP Unit, or $285.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018, HTA's and HTALP's Normalized FFO was $1.62 per diluted share and OP Unit, or $340.4 million, compared to $1.63 per diluted share and OP Unit, or $302.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For additional information on FFO and Normalized FFO, see FFO and Normalized FFO\u201d below, which includes a reconciliation to net income attributable to common stockholders/unitholders and an explanation of why we present this non-GAAP financial measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018, NOI increased 12.8%, or $54.0 million, to $475.8 million, compared to $421.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018, Same-Property Cash NOI increased 2.5%, or $7.5 million, to $308.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For additional information on NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI, see NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI\u201d below, which includes a reconciliation from net income and an explanation of why we present these non-GAAP financial measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Market Focused Strategy and Investments\nWe believe we have been one of the most active investors in the medical office sector over the last decade.

We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical as they may require more complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For further information on significant accounting policies that impact us, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities in which we own a majority interest with the ability control operations. We consolidate variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) when we are the primary beneficiary. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form or ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the VIE, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue is our primary source of revenue. At the inception of a new lease we assess the terms and conditions to determine proper classification. If the estimates utilized by us in our assessment were different, then our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different, which could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized. We recognize rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease (including rent holidays). Tenant reimbursement revenue, which is comprised of additional amounts recoverable from tenants for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses, is recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Effective January 1, 2018, with the adoption of Topic 606, the revenue recognition process is based on a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For more detailed information on Topic 606, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWith the adoption of ASU 2017-01 in January 2017 the majority of our investments in real estate investments have been accounted for as asset acquisitions and we record the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. Tangible assets primarily consist of land and buildings and improvements. Additionally, the purchase price includes acquisition related expenses, above or below market leases, above or below market leasehold interests, in place leases, tenant relationships, above or below market debt assumed, interest rate swaps assumed and any contingent consideration recorded when the contingency is resolved. The determination of the fair value requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions.\nThe fair value of the land and buildings and improvements is based upon our determination of the value of the property as if it were to be replaced or as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by market participants. Factors considered by us include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.\nThe value of in place leases is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. The factors considered include estimated lease-up periods, market rent and other market conditions.\nWe analyze the acquired leases to determine whether the rental rates are above or below market. The value associated with above or below market leases is based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) our estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease.\nWe analyze the acquired leasehold interests to determine whether the rental rates are above or below market. The value associated with above or below market leasehold interests is based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) our estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease.\nWe record debt or interest rate swaps assumed at fair value. The amount of above or below market debt is determined based upon the present value of the difference between the cash flow stream of the assumed mortgage and the cash flow stream of a market rate mortgage. The value of interest rate swaps is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows, taking into account interest rate curves and the period to maturity.\nWe are required to make certain estimates in order to determine the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired in a business investment. Our assumptions directly impact our results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation and amortization lives. In addition, the amortization and depreciation of these assets and liabilities are recorded in different line items in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRecoverability of Real Estate Investments\nReal estate investments are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the sum of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset over the remaining expected holding period. We would recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount is not recoverable to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the property. The fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analyses. In performing the analysis we consider executed sales agreements or management's best estimate of market comparables, future occupancy levels, rental rates, capitalization rates, lease-up periods and capital requirements.\nRecently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for a discussion of recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements.\nFactors Which May Influence Results of Operations\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally and the risk factors previously listed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the investment, management and operation of our properties.\nRental Income\nThe amount of rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that will become available from unscheduled lease terminations at the then applicable rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had investments with an aggregate purchase price of $17.8 million, $2.7 billion and $700.8 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had dispositions with an aggregate gross sales price of $308.6 million, $85.2 million and $39.5 million, respectively. The amount of any future acquisitions or dispositions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nAs of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we owned and operated approximately 23.2 million, 24.1 million and 17.7 million square feet of GLA, respectively, with a leased rate of 92.0%, 91.8% and 91.9%, respectively (which includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced), and an occupancy rate of 91.0%, 91.0% and 91.2%, respectively.

The increase in rental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared 2017 were primarily due to $35.3 million of additional rental expenses associated with our 2017 and 2018 acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies and a decrease in rental expense as a result of the buildings we sold during 2017 and 2018. The increase in rental expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, was primarily due to $51.4 million of additional rental expenses associated with our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies and a decrease in rental expenses as a result of the buildings we sold during 2016 and 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 general and administrative expenses were $35.2 million, $33.4 million and $28.8 million, respectively. These increases were primarily due to an increase in non-cash compensation expense and an overall increase in head count due to the continued growth of the company. General and administrative expenses include such costs as salaries, corporate overhead and professional fees, among other items.\nTransaction Expenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, transaction expenses were $1.0 million, $5.9 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The increase in 2017 compared to 2018 was primarily due to $4.6 million of non-incremental costs related to the Duke acquisition. Additionally, in 2017, transaction costs reflect the prospective presentation of the early adoption of ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017. As a result of the adoption, a significant portion of these expenses are now capitalized as part of our investment allocations.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, depreciation and amortization expense was $279.6 million, $245.0 million and $176.9 million, respectively. These increases were associated with our 2017 and 2018 investments, partially offset by buildings we sold during 2017 and 2018.\nImpairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded impairment charges of $8.9 million which related to six MOBs located in Tennessee, Texas and South Carolina. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded impairment charges of $13.9 million related to two MOBs and a portfolio of MOBs located in Massachusetts, South Carolina and Texas. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $3.1 million that related to two MOBs in our portfolio.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $15.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the increase was primarily the result of higher weighted average debt outstanding, as a result of the full year impact of the issuance of two long-term senior unsecured notes, a $400.0 million and $500.0 million 5-year and 10-year senior unsecured notes issued in June 2017 at a coupon rate of 2.95% per annum and 3.75% per annum, respectively and a $300.0 million unsecured term loan we obtained in July 2017. Interest expense, excluding the impact of the net change in fair value of derivative financial instruments, increased by $24.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily the result of higher average debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of partially funding our investments over the last 12 months with debt and a change in the composition of debt, driven by an increase in long-term senior unsecured notes, including the $350.0 million 10-year senior unsecured notes issued by HTALP in July 2016 at a coupon rate of 3.50% per annum, the $400.0 million and $500.0 million 5-year and 10-year senior unsecured notes issued by HTALP in June 2017 at a coupon rate of 2.95% per annum and 3.75% per annum, respectively.\nTo achieve our objectives, we borrow at both fixed and variable rates. From time to time, we also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we realized a net gain on the sale of real estate of $166.0 million. These gains were primarily the result of the Greenville Disposition. See Note 4 - Impairment and Dispositions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for more detail on the Greenville Disposition. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we realized a net gain of $37.8 million from the disposition of four MOBs located in Wisconsin, California and Texas. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized a net gain of $9.0 million from the disposition of six senior care facilities located in Texas and California.\nGain (loss) on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, we realized a net gain on the extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we realized a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of $11.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The gain in 2018 was primarily due to the prepayment of fixed rate mortgages which we had associated above market debt, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the Greenville Disposition. The increased loss in 2017 over 2016 was primarily due to fees we incurred in connection with the execution and our termination of a bridge loan facility we entered into as part of the Duke acquisition.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $152.0 million to $217.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income increased $18.2 million to $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. These increases were primarily the result of continued growth in our operations, improved operating efficiencies, and the $166.0 million net gain on the sale of real estate we realized for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNOI and Same-Property Cash NOI\nNOI increased $54.0 million to $475.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to $60.1 million of additional NOI from our 2017 and 2018 acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by a decrease in NOI as a result of the buildings we sold during 2017 and 2018 and a reduction in straight-line rent from properties we owned more than a year. NOI increased $104.7 million to $421.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to $96.2 million of additional NOI from our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by a decrease in NOI as a result of the buildings we sold during 2016 and 2017 and a reduction in straight-line rent from properties we owned more than a year.\nSame-Property Cash NOI increased $7.5 million, or 2.5%, to $308.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Same-Property Cash NOI increased $8.0 million, or 2.9%, to $284.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. These increases were primarily the result of rent escalations, an increase in average occupancy, and improved operating efficiencies.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFFO and Normalized FFO\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the current standards established by NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property and impairment write-downs of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization related to investments in real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, among other items, it provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders.\nWe also compute Normalized FFO, which excludes from FFO: (i) transaction expenses; (ii) gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative financial instruments; (iii) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (iv) noncontrolling income or loss from OP Units included in diluted shares (only applicable to the Company); and (v) other normalizing items, which include items that are unusual and infrequent in nature. Our methodology for calculating Normalized FFO may be different from the methods utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to other REITs.\nWe present FFO and Normalized FFO because we consider them important supplemental measures of our operating performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Historical cost accounting assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen based on market conditions, many industry investors have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance, nor are they indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. FFO and Normalized FFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nIn addition, the amounts included in the calculation of FFO and Normalized FFO are generally the same for HTALP and HTA, except for net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders, noncontrolling income or loss from OP Units included in diluted shares (only applicable to the Company) and the weighted average shares of our common stock or HTALP OP Units outstanding.\nThe following is the reconciliation of HTA's FFO and Normalized FFO to net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

financial measure that is defined as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) before: (i) general and administrative expenses; (ii) transaction expenses; (iii) depreciation and amortization expense; (iv) impairment; (v) interest expense and net change in fair value of derivative financial instruments; (vi) gain or loss on sales of real estate; (vii) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (viii) income or loss from unconsolidated joint venture; and (ix) other income or expense. We believe that NOI provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of our properties. Additionally, we believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of REITs. However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance. NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes from NOI: (i) straight-line rent adjustments; (ii) amortization of below and above market leases/leasehold interests; (iii) notes receivable interest income; and (iv) other GAAP adjustments. Contractual base rent, contractual rent increases, contractual rent concessions and changes in occupancy or lease rates upon commencement and expiration of leases are a primary driver of our revenue performance. We believe that Cash NOI, which removes the impact of straight-line rent adjustments, provides another measurement of the operating performance of our operating assets. Additionally, we believe that Cash NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of REITs. However, our use of the term Cash NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance. Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nTo facilitate the comparison of Cash NOI between periods, we calculate comparable amounts for a subset of our owned and operational properties referred to as Same-Property\u201d. Same-Property Cash NOI excludes (i) properties which have not been owned and operated by us during the entire span of all periods presented and disposed properties, (ii) our share of unconsolidated joint ventures, (iii) development, redevelopment and land parcels, (iv) properties intended for disposition in the near term which have (a) been approved by the Board of Directors, (b) is actively marketed for sale, and (c) an offer has been received at prices we would transact and the sales process is ongoing, and (v) certain non-routine items. Same-Property Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance. Same-Property Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nThe following is the reconciliation of HTA's and HTALP's NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI to net income

During the next 12 months our primary uses of cash are expected to include: (a) the funding of acquisitions of MOBs, development properties and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry; (b) capital expenditures; (c) the payment of operating expenses; (d) debt service payments, including principal payments; and (e) the payment of dividends to our stockholders. We anticipate cash flow from operations, restricted cash and reserve accounts and our unsecured revolving credit facility, if needed, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders. Investments and maturing indebtedness may require funds from the issuance of debt and/or equity securities or proceeds from sales of real estate.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had liquidity of $1.1 billion, including $1.0 billion available under our unsecured revolving credit facility and $126.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nIn addition, we had unencumbered assets with a gross book value of $6.6 billion. The unencumbered properties may be used as collateral to secure additional financings in future periods or refinance our current debt as it becomes due. Our ability to raise funds from future debt and equity issuances is dependent on our investment grade credit ratings, general economic and market conditions and our operating performance.\nWhen we acquire a property, we prepare a capital plan that contemplates the estimated capital needs of that investment. In addition to operating expenses, capital needs may also include costs of refurbishment, tenant improvements or other major capital expenditures. The capital plan for each investment will be adjusted through ongoing, regular reviews of our portfolio or as necessary to respond to unanticipated additional capital needs. As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that our expenditures for capital improvements for 2019 will range from $70 million to $80 million depending on leasing activity. Although we cannot provide assurance that we will not exceed these estimated expenditure levels, our liquidity of $1.1 billion allows us the flexibility to fund such capital expenditures.\nIf we experience lower occupancy levels, reduced rental rates, reduced revenues as a result of asset sales, or increased capital expenditures and leasing costs compared to historical levels due to competitive market conditions for new and renewal leases, the effect would be a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities. If such a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities is realized, we may have a cash flow deficit in subsequent periods. Our estimate of net cash available is based on various assumptions which are difficult to predict, including the levels of our leasing activity and related leasing costs. Any changes in these assumptions could impact our financial results and our ability to fund working capital and unanticipated cash needs\nCash Flows\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively (in thousands): Table 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Year Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prior Year Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash - beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,917\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>337,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>176,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,455,096\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(608,393\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,631,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,846,703\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(498,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,241,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,739,803\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,840,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash - end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased in 2018 primarily due to the impact of our 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, contractual rent increases and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by our 2017 and 2018 dispositions. We anticipate cash flows from operating activities to increase as a result of the above items and continued leasing activity in our existing portfolio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities primarily related to proceeds from the sale of real estate of $305.1 million, which was partially offset by capital expenditures of $77.9 million and development of real estate of $34.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities primarily related to the investment in real estate of $2.4 billion, investment in unconsolidated joint venture of $68.8 million, and capital expenditures of $64.8 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real estate of $80.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities primarily related to the investment in real estate of $592.0 million and capital expenditures of $43.0 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real estate of $26.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities primarily related to dividends paid to holders of our common stock of $252.7 million, payments on our secured mortgage loans of $241.0 million, and repurchases of our common stock of $70.3 million, which was partially offset by net proceeds of shares of common stock issued of $72.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities primarily related to the net proceeds of shares of common stock issued of $1.7 billion and net proceeds on the issuance of senior notes of $900.0 million, which was partially offset by dividends paid to holders of our common stock of $207.1 million, net payments on our unsecured revolving credit facility of $88.0 million and payments on our secured mortgage loans of $77.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities primarily related to the net proceeds of shares of common stock issued of $418.9 million and proceeds from unsecured senior notes of $347.7 million, which was partially offset by dividends paid to holders of our common stock of $159.2 million, net payments on our unsecured revolving credit facility of $130.0 million, and payments on our secured mortgage loans of $110.9 million.\nDividends\nThe amount of dividends we pay to our stockholders is determined by our Board of Directors, in their sole discretion, and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual dividend distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have paid monthly or quarterly dividends since February 2007, and if our investments produce sufficient cash flow, we expect to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders. Because our cash available for dividend distributions in any year may be less than 90% of our taxable income for the year, we may obtain the necessary funds through borrowings, issuing new securities or selling assets to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy our dividend distribution requirement. Our organizational documents do not establish a limit on dividends that may constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. The dividend we pay to our stockholders is equal to the distributions received from HTALP in accordance with the terms of the HTALP partnership agreement. It is our intention to continue to pay dividends. However, our Board of Directors may reduce our dividend rate and we cannot guarantee the timing and amount of dividends that we may pay in the future, if any.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid cash dividends of $252.7 million on our common stock. In January 2019, we paid cash dividends on our common stock of $63.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.\nFinancing\nWe have historically maintained a low leveraged balance sheet and intend to continue to maintain this structure in the long term. However, our total leverage may fluctuate on a short-term basis as we execute our business strategy. As of December 31, 2018, our leverage ratio, measured by debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization, was 31.3%.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had debt outstanding of $2.5 billion and the weighted average interest rate therein was 3.47% per annum, inclusive of the impact of our cash flow hedges. The following is a summary of our unsecured and secured debt. See Note 7 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for a further discussion of our debt.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2018, $1.0 billion was available on our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Our unsecured revolving credit facility matures in June 2022.\nUnsecured Term Loans\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $500.0 million of unsecured term loans outstanding, comprised of $300.0 million under our Unsecured Credit Agreement maturing in 2023, and $200.0 million under our unsecured term loan maturing in 2024.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.85 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding, comprised of $300.0 million of senior notes maturing in 2021, $400.0 million of senior notes maturing in 2022, $300.0 million of senior notes maturing in 2023, $350.0 million of senior notes maturing in 2026, and $500.0 million of senior notes maturing in 2027.\nFixed and Variable Rate Mortgages\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we made payments on our fixed and variable rate mortgages of $241.0 million and have $97.4 million of principal payments due in 2019.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nSee Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for a further discussion of our commitments and contingencies.\nDebt Service Requirements\nWe are required by the terms of our applicable loan agreements to meet certain financial covenants, such as minimum net worth and liquidity, and reporting requirements, among others. As of December 31, 2018, we believe that we were in compliance with all such covenants and we are not aware of any covenants that it is reasonably likely that we would not be able to meet in accordance with our loan agreements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below presents our obligations and commitments to make future payments under our debt obligations and lease agreements as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>399,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,014,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,050,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,561,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (1)\n</td> <td>88,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>482,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground lease and other operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>10,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>639,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>689,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,150,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,801,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,733,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Interest on variable rate debt is calculated using the forward rates in effect at December 31, 2018 and excludes the impact of our interest rate swaps.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor more detail regarding our adoption of Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 see Topic 842, Leases\u201d subsection of the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d within Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of and during the year ended December 31, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, other than operating lease arrangements consisting primarily of ground leases which as of December 31, 2018 were not carried on our consolidated balance sheets.\nInflation\nWe are exposed to inflation risk as income from future long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that protect us from the impact of normal inflation. These provisions include rent escalations, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges and real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot allowance. However, due to the long-term nature of our leases, among other factors, the leases may not reset frequently enough to cover inflation.", "summary": "The report, which includes Management's Discussion and Analysis, details the financial condition and results of operations of HTA and HTALP as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

We conduct substantially all of our operations through HTALP. We invest in MOBs that we believe will serve the future of healthcare delivery and MOBs that are primarily located on health system campuses, near university medical centers, or in core community outpatient locations. We also focus on our key markets that have certain demographic and macro-economic trends and where we can utilize our institutional full-service operating platform to generate strong tenant and health system relationships and operating cost efficiencies. Our primary objective is to maximize stockholder value with disciplined growth through strategic investments that provide an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders by consistently increasing our cash flow. In pursuing this objective, we: (i) seek internal growth through proactive asset management, leasing, building services and property management oversight; (ii) target accretive acquisitions and developments of MOBs in markets with attractive demographics that complement our existing portfolio; and (iii) actively manage our balance sheet to maintain flexibility with conservative leverage. Additionally, from time to time we consider, on an opportunistic basis, significant portfolio acquisitions that we believe fit our core business and could enhance our existing portfolio.\nSince 2006, we have invested $6.8 billion primarily in MOBs, development projects, land and other healthcare real estate assets consisting of approximately 23.2 million square feet of GLA throughout the U.S. Approximately 68% of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or adjacent to, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. Our portfolio is diversified geographically across 32 states, with no state having more than 20% of our total GLA as of December 31, 2018. We are concentrated in 20 to 25 key markets that are experiencing higher economic and demographic trends than other markets, on average, that we expect will drive demand for MOBs. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in nine of our top ten markets and approximately 93% of our portfolio, based on GLA, is located in the top 75 MSAs, with Dallas, Houston, Boston, Tampa and Atlanta being our largest markets by investment.\nCompany Highlights\nPortfolio Operating Performance\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, total revenue increased 13.4%, or $82.4 million, to $696.4 million, compared to $614.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $217.6 million, compared to $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.02 per diluted share, or $213.5 million, compared to $0.34 per diluted share, or $63.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, HTA's FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $335.6 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $1.53 per diluted share, or $284.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, HTALP's FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $339.6 million, or $1.62 per diluted OP Unit, compared to $1.54 per diluted OP Unit, or $285.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, HTA's and HTALP's Normalized FFO was $1.62 per diluted share and OP Unit, or $340.4 million, compared to $1.63 per diluted share and OP Unit, or $302.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For additional information on FFO and Normalized FFO, see FFO and Normalized FFO\u201d below, which includes a reconciliation to net income attributable to common stockholders/unitholders and an explanation of why we present this non-GAAP financial measure. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, NOI increased 12.8%, or $54.0 million, to $475.8 million, compared to $421.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, Same-Property Cash NOI increased 2.5%, or $7.5 million, to $308.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For additional information on NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI, see NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI\u201d below, which includes a reconciliation from net income and an explanation of why we present these non-GAAP financial measures. \nKey Market Focused Strategy and Investments\nWe believe we have been one of the most active investors in the medical office sector over the last decade. This has enabled us to create a high quality portfolio focused on MOBs serving the future of healthcare with scale and significance in 20 to 25 key markets.\n \u2022 Our investment strategy includes alignment with key healthcare systems, hospitals, and leading academic medical universities. We are the largest owner of on-campus or adjacent MOBs in the country, with approximately 16 million square feet of GLA, or 68% of our portfolio, located in these locations. The remaining 32% of our portfolio is located in core community outpatient locations where healthcare is increasingly being delivered. \n \u2022 Over the last several years, our investments have been focused in our 20 to 25 key markets which we believe will outperform the broader U.S. from an economic and demographic perspective. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 93% of our portfolio's GLA is located in the top 75 MSAs. Our key markets represent top MSAs with strong growth metrics in jobs, household income and population, as well as low unemployment and mature healthcare infrastructures. Many of our key markets are also supported by strong university systems. \n \u2022 Our key market focus has enabled us to establish scale and effectively utilize our asset management and leasing platform to deliver consistent same store growth and additional yield on investments, and also cost effective service to tenants. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in nine of our top ten markets and approximately 0.5 million square feet in each of our top 15 markets. We expect to establish this scale across 20 to 25 key markets as our portfolio expands. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, HTA completed the disposition of 20 MOBs, primarily located in Greenville, South Carolina for an aggregate gross sales price of $308.6 million, representing approximately 1.2 million square feet of GLA, and generating net gains of $166.0 million. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we (i) announced a new development in our key gateway market of Miami, Florida and (ii) commenced two redevelopments, including an agreement to build a new on-campus MOB in Raleigh, North Carolina. These projects will have total expected construction costs of approximately $70.6 million and are approximately 78% pre-leased to major health systems.  Internal Growth through Proactive In-House Property Management and Leasing\nWe believe we have the largest full-service operating platform in the medical office sector that consists of our in-house property management and leasing which allows us to better manage and service our existing portfolio. In each of these markets, we have established a strong in-house asset management and leasing platform that has allowed us to develop valuable relationships with health systems, physician practices, universities, and regional development firms that have led to investment and leasing opportunities. Our full-service operating platform has also enabled us to focus on generating cost efficiencies as we gain scale across individual markets and regions.\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, our in-house asset management and leasing platform operated approximately 21.6 million square feet of GLA, or 93%, of our total portfolio, a significant increase from 8.8 million square feet, or 70%, of GLA managed in-house in 2012. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, our leased rate (which includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced) was 92.0% by GLA, an increase of 20 basis points, compared to December 31, 2017, and our occupancy rate was 91.0% by GLA. \n \u2022 We entered into new and renewal leases on approximately 2.8 million square feet of GLA, or over 12%, of the GLA of our total portfolio, during the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio was 81%, which included approximately 2.4 million square feet of GLA of expiring leases, which we believe is indicative of our commitment to maintaining buildings in desirable locations and fostering strong tenant relationships. Tenant retention is defined as the sum of the total leased GLA of tenants that renewed a lease during the period over the total GLA of leases that renewed or expired during the period.  Financial Strategy and Balance Sheet Flexibility\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, we had total leverage, measured by debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization, of 31.3%. Total liquidity was $1.1 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $126.2 million and $1.0 billion available on our unsecured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average remaining term of our debt portfolio was 5.0 years, including extension options. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid down approximately $241.0 million of outstanding secured mortgage loans, including the settlement of three cash flow hedges, utilizing net proceeds from our Greenville Disposition to do so. Additionally, in August 2018, HTALP entered into a modification of our $200.0 million unsecured term loan previously due in 2023. The modification decreased pricing at our current credit rating by 65 basis points and extended the maturity date to 2024. The other material terms of the unsecured term loan prior to the modification remained substantially unchanged. \n \u2022 In August 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing us to purchase up to $300.0 million of our common stock from time to time prior to the expiration thereof on June 7, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock, at an average price of $26.12 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $67.2 million, pursuant to this stock repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining amount of common stock available for repurchase under the stock repurchase plan was approximately $232.8 million. \n \u2022 In December 2018, we entered into new equity distribution agreements with various sales agents with respect to our at the market ( ATM\u201d) offering program of common stock with an aggregate sales amount of up to $500.0 million. We contemporaneously terminated our prior ATM equity distribution agreements. \n \u2022 In June 2018, we settled a forward sale arrangement pursuant to a forward equity agreement that was entered into in October 2017, which included approximately 2.6 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $73.8 million, adjusted for costs to borrow equating to a net price to us of $28.94 per share of common stock. \n \u2022 On February 14, 2019, our Board of Directors announced a quarterly dividend of $0.310 per share of common stock and per OP Unit.  Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting principles, including making estimates. We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical as they may require more complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For further information on significant accounting policies that impact us, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities in which we own a majority interest with the ability control operations. We consolidate variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) when we are the primary beneficiary. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form or ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the VIE, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue is our primary source of revenue. At the inception of a new lease we assess the terms and conditions to determine proper classification. If the estimates utilized by us in our assessment were different, then our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different, which could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized. We recognize rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease (including rent holidays). Tenant reimbursement revenue, which is comprised of additional amounts recoverable from tenants for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses, is recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Effective January 1, 2018, with the adoption of Topic 606, the revenue recognition process is based on a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For more detailed information on Topic 606, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWith the adoption of ASU 2017-01 in January 2017 the majority of our investments in real estate investments have been accounted for as asset acquisitions and we record the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. Tangible assets primarily consist of land and buildings and improvements. Additionally, the purchase price includes acquisition related expenses, above or below market leases, above or below market leasehold interests, in place leases, tenant relationships, above or below market debt assumed, interest rate swaps assumed and any contingent consideration recorded when the contingency is resolved. The determination of the fair value requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions.\nThe fair value of the land and buildings and improvements is based upon our determination of the value of the property as if it were to be replaced or as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by market participants. Factors considered by us include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.\nThe value of in place leases is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. The factors considered include estimated lease-up periods, market rent and other market conditions.\nWe analyze the acquired leases to determine whether the rental rates are above or below market. The value associated with above or below market leases is based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) our estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease.\nWe analyze the acquired leasehold interests to determine whether the rental rates are above or below market. The value associated with above or below market leasehold interests is based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) our estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease.\nWe record debt or interest rate swaps assumed at fair value. The amount of above or below market debt is determined based upon the present value of the difference between the cash flow stream of the assumed mortgage and the cash flow stream of a market rate mortgage. The value of interest rate swaps is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows, taking into account interest rate curves and the period to maturity.\nWe are required to make certain estimates in order to determine the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired in a business investment. Our assumptions directly impact our results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation and amortization lives. In addition, the amortization and depreciation of these assets and liabilities are recorded in different line items in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRecoverability of Real Estate Investments\nReal estate investments are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the sum of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset over the remaining expected holding period. We would recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount is not recoverable to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the property. The fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analyses. In performing the analysis we consider executed sales agreements or management's best estimate of market comparables, future occupancy levels, rental rates, capitalization rates, lease-up periods and capital requirements.\nRecently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for a discussion of recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements.\nFactors Which May Influence Results of Operations\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally and the risk factors previously listed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the investment, management and operation of our properties.\nRental Income\nThe amount of rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that will become available from unscheduled lease terminations at the then applicable rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had investments with an aggregate purchase price of $17.8 million, $2.7 billion and $700.8 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had dispositions with an aggregate gross sales price of $308.6 million, $85.2 million and $39.5 million, respectively.

We conduct substantially all of our operations through HTALP. We invest in MOBs that we believe will serve the future of healthcare delivery and MOBs that are primarily located on health system campuses, near university medical centers, or in core community outpatient locations. We also focus on our key markets that have certain demographic and macro-economic trends and where we can utilize our institutional full-service operating platform to generate strong tenant and health system relationships and operating cost efficiencies. Our primary objective is to maximize stockholder value with disciplined growth through strategic investments that provide an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders by consistently increasing our cash flow. In pursuing this objective, we: (i) seek internal growth through proactive asset management, leasing, building services and property management oversight; (ii) target accretive acquisitions and developments of MOBs in markets with attractive demographics that complement our existing portfolio; and (iii) actively manage our balance sheet to maintain flexibility with conservative leverage. Additionally, from time to time we consider, on an opportunistic basis, significant portfolio acquisitions that we believe fit our core business and could enhance our existing portfolio.\nSince 2006, we have invested $6.8 billion primarily in MOBs, development projects, land and other healthcare real estate assets consisting of approximately 23.2 million square feet of GLA throughout the U.S. Approximately 68% of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or adjacent to, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. Our portfolio is diversified geographically across 32 states, with no state having more than 20% of our total GLA as of December 31, 2018. We are concentrated in 20 to 25 key markets that are experiencing higher economic and demographic trends than other markets, on average, that we expect will drive demand for MOBs. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in nine of our top ten markets and approximately 93% of our portfolio, based on GLA, is located in the top 75 MSAs, with Dallas, Houston, Boston, Tampa and Atlanta being our largest markets by investment.\nCompany Highlights\nPortfolio Operating Performance\n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, total revenue increased 13.4%, or $82.4 million, to $696.4 million, compared to $614.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $217.6 million, compared to $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.02 per diluted share, or $213.5 million, compared to $0.34 per diluted share, or $63.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, HTA's FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $335.6 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $1.53 per diluted share, or $284.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, HTALP's FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $339.6 million, or $1.62 per diluted OP Unit, compared to $1.54 per diluted OP Unit, or $285.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, HTA's and HTALP's Normalized FFO was $1.62 per diluted share and OP Unit, or $340.4 million, compared to $1.63 per diluted share and OP Unit, or $302.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For additional information on FFO and Normalized FFO, see FFO and Normalized FFO\u201d below, which includes a reconciliation to net income attributable to common stockholders/unitholders and an explanation of why we present this non-GAAP financial measure. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, NOI increased 12.8%, or $54.0 million, to $475.8 million, compared to $421.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For the year ended December 31, 2018, Same-Property Cash NOI increased 2.5%, or $7.5 million, to $308.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 For additional information on NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI, see NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI\u201d below, which includes a reconciliation from net income and an explanation of why we present these non-GAAP financial measures. \nKey Market Focused Strategy and Investments\nWe believe we have been one of the most active investors in the medical office sector over the last decade. This has enabled us to create a high quality portfolio focused on MOBs serving the future of healthcare with scale and significance in 20 to 25 key markets.\n \u2022 Our investment strategy includes alignment with key healthcare systems, hospitals, and leading academic medical universities. We are the largest owner of on-campus or adjacent MOBs in the country, with approximately 16 million square feet of GLA, or 68% of our portfolio, located in these locations. The remaining 32% of our portfolio is located in core community outpatient locations where healthcare is increasingly being delivered. \n \u2022 Over the last several years, our investments have been focused in our 20 to 25 key markets which we believe will outperform the broader U.S. from an economic and demographic perspective. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 93% of our portfolio's GLA is located in the top 75 MSAs. Our key markets represent top MSAs with strong growth metrics in jobs, household income and population, as well as low unemployment and mature healthcare infrastructures. Many of our key markets are also supported by strong university systems. \n \u2022 Our key market focus has enabled us to establish scale and effectively utilize our asset management and leasing platform to deliver consistent same store growth and additional yield on investments, and also cost effective service to tenants. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in nine of our top ten markets and approximately 0.5 million square feet in each of our top 15 markets. We expect to establish this scale across 20 to 25 key markets as our portfolio expands. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, HTA completed the disposition of 20 MOBs, primarily located in Greenville, South Carolina for an aggregate gross sales price of $308.6 million, representing approximately 1.2 million square feet of GLA, and generating net gains of $166.0 million. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we (i) announced a new development in our key gateway market of Miami, Florida and (ii) commenced two redevelopments, including an agreement to build a new on-campus MOB in Raleigh, North Carolina. These projects will have total expected construction costs of approximately $70.6 million and are approximately 78% pre-leased to major health systems.  Internal Growth through Proactive In-House Property Management and Leasing\nWe believe we have the largest full-service operating platform in the medical office sector that consists of our in-house property management and leasing which allows us to better manage and service our existing portfolio. In each of these markets, we have established a strong in-house asset management and leasing platform that has allowed us to develop valuable relationships with health systems, physician practices, universities, and regional development firms that have led to investment and leasing opportunities. Our full-service operating platform has also enabled us to focus on generating cost efficiencies as we gain scale across individual markets and regions.\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, our in-house asset management and leasing platform operated approximately 21.6 million square feet of GLA, or 93%, of our total portfolio, a significant increase from 8.8 million square feet, or 70%, of GLA managed in-house in 2012. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, our leased rate (which includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced) was 92.0% by GLA, an increase of 20 basis points, compared to December 31, 2017, and our occupancy rate was 91.0% by GLA. \n \u2022 We entered into new and renewal leases on approximately 2.8 million square feet of GLA, or over 12%, of the GLA of our total portfolio, during the year ended December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio was 81%, which included approximately 2.4 million square feet of GLA of expiring leases, which we believe is indicative of our commitment to maintaining buildings in desirable locations and fostering strong tenant relationships. Tenant retention is defined as the sum of the total leased GLA of tenants that renewed a lease during the period over the total GLA of leases that renewed or expired during the period.  Financial Strategy and Balance Sheet Flexibility\n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, we had total leverage, measured by debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization, of 31.3%. Total liquidity was $1.1 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $126.2 million and $1.0 billion available on our unsecured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average remaining term of our debt portfolio was 5.0 years, including extension options. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid down approximately $241.0 million of outstanding secured mortgage loans, including the settlement of three cash flow hedges, utilizing net proceeds from our Greenville Disposition to do so. Additionally, in August 2018, HTALP entered into a modification of our $200.0 million unsecured term loan previously due in 2023. The modification decreased pricing at our current credit rating by 65 basis points and extended the maturity date to 2024. The other material terms of the unsecured term loan prior to the modification remained substantially unchanged. \n \u2022 In August 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing us to purchase up to $300.0 million of our common stock from time to time prior to the expiration thereof on June 7, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock, at an average price of $26.12 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $67.2 million, pursuant to this stock repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining amount of common stock available for repurchase under the stock repurchase plan was approximately $232.8 million. \n \u2022 In December 2018, we entered into new equity distribution agreements with various sales agents with respect to our at the market ( ATM\u201d) offering program of common stock with an aggregate sales amount of up to $500.0 million. We contemporaneously terminated our prior ATM equity distribution agreements. \n \u2022 In June 2018, we settled a forward sale arrangement pursuant to a forward equity agreement that was entered into in October 2017, which included approximately 2.6 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $73.8 million, adjusted for costs to borrow equating to a net price to us of $28.94 per share of common stock. \n \u2022 On February 14, 2019, our Board of Directors announced a quarterly dividend of $0.310 per share of common stock and per OP Unit.  Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting principles, including making estimates. We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical as they may require more complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For further information on significant accounting policies that impact us, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities in which we own a majority interest with the ability control operations. We consolidate variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) when we are the primary beneficiary. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form or ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the VIE, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue is our primary source of revenue. At the inception of a new lease we assess the terms and conditions to determine proper classification. If the estimates utilized by us in our assessment were different, then our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different, which could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized. We recognize rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease (including rent holidays). Tenant reimbursement revenue, which is comprised of additional amounts recoverable from tenants for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses, is recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Effective January 1, 2018, with the adoption of Topic 606, the revenue recognition process is based on a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. Topic 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For more detailed information on Topic 606, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWith the adoption of ASU 2017-01 in January 2017 the majority of our investments in real estate investments have been accounted for as asset acquisitions and we record the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. Tangible assets primarily consist of land and buildings and improvements. Additionally, the purchase price includes acquisition related expenses, above or below market leases, above or below market leasehold interests, in place leases, tenant relationships, above or below market debt assumed, interest rate swaps assumed and any contingent consideration recorded when the contingency is resolved. The determination of the fair value requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions.\nThe fair value of the land and buildings and improvements is based upon our determination of the value of the property as if it were to be replaced or as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by market participants. Factors considered by us include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.\nThe value of in place leases is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. The factors considered include estimated lease-up periods, market rent and other market conditions.\nWe analyze the acquired leases to determine whether the rental rates are above or below market. The value associated with above or below market leases is based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) our estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease.\nWe analyze the acquired leasehold interests to determine whether the rental rates are above or below market. The value associated with above or below market leasehold interests is based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) our estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease.\nWe record debt or interest rate swaps assumed at fair value. The amount of above or below market debt is determined based upon the present value of the difference between the cash flow stream of the assumed mortgage and the cash flow stream of a market rate mortgage. The value of interest rate swaps is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows, taking into account interest rate curves and the period to maturity.\nWe are required to make certain estimates in order to determine the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired in a business investment. Our assumptions directly impact our results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation and amortization lives. In addition, the amortization and depreciation of these assets and liabilities are recorded in different line items in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRecoverability of Real Estate Investments\nReal estate investments are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the sum of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset over the remaining expected holding period. We would recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount is not recoverable to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the property. The fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analyses. In performing the analysis we consider executed sales agreements or management's best estimate of market comparables, future occupancy levels, rental rates, capitalization rates, lease-up periods and capital requirements.\nRecently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 for a discussion of recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements.\nFactors Which May Influence Results of Operations\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally and the risk factors previously listed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the investment, management and operation of our properties.\nRental Income\nThe amount of rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that will become available from unscheduled lease terminations at the then applicable rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had investments with an aggregate purchase price of $17.8 million, $2.7 billion and $700.8 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had dispositions with an aggregate gross sales price of $308.6 million, $85.2 million and $39.5 million, respectively. The amount of any future acquisitions or dispositions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nAs of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we owned and operated approximately 23.2 million, 24.1 million and 17.7 million square feet of GLA, respectively, with a leased rate of 92.0%, 91.8% and 91.9%, respectively (which includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced), and an occupancy rate of 91.0%, 91.0% and 91.2%, respectively. All explanations are applicable to both HTA and HTALP unless otherwise noted.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, is set forth below:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td>
