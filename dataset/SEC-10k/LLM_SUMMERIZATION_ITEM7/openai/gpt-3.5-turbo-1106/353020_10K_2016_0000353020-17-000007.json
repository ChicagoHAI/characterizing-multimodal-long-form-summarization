Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nExecutive Summary\nAegion combines innovative technologies with market leading expertise to maintain, rehabilitate and strengthen infrastructure around the world. Since 1971, we have played a pioneering role in finding innovative solutions to rehabilitate aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in the wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries. We also maintain the efficient operation of refineries and other industrial facilities and provide innovative solutions for the strengthening of buildings, bridges and other structures. We are committed to Stronger. Safer. Infrastructure\u00ae. Our products and services are currently utilized in approximately 80 countries across six continents. We believe the depth and breadth of our products and services make us a leading provider for the world's infrastructure rehabilitation and protection needs.\nBusiness Outlook\nWe believe favorable end markets and the progress made over the last two years to advance our long-term strategy give us the opportunity to grow revenue and operating income across all three platforms in 2017, which is expected to result in strong earnings per share growth, greater cash generation and an increase in return on invested capital.\nInfrastructure Solutions\nWe will make investments in 2017 to expand the use of Insituform\u00ae CIPP in several regions currently underserved by Insituform in the North American wastewater pipeline market. Our objective is to maintain growth and our leading share in a large and mature market. Outside North America, we are selectively targeting markets in Europe for contract installation of Insituform\u00ae CIPP to compliment a strategy to grow third-party product sales across the continent. We are also pursuing additional contract installations opportunities in Australia and plan to grow third-party CIPP sales in several Asian countries.\nOne of the most attractive areas for growth is in the rehabilitation of municipal pressure pipelines, primarily in North America. We have a diverse portfolio of solutions in a highly fragmented and growing North American market. We also have an attractive market in Asia-Pacific for large-diameter pressure pipe strengthening. We completed a research and development effort in 2016 that is expected to significantly reduce material and installation costs for Tyfo\u00ae Fibrwrap\u00ae while maintaining the superior material properties and quality of the technology. We also improved our InsituMain\u00ae CIPP technology to give customers a more robust solution. These enhancements and favorable market conditions support our expectations for growth in 2017.\nWith favorable end markets, strategic investments and technology enhancements, we expect Infrastructure Solutions in 2017 to grow revenues faster than the low-to-mid-single digit three-year target. However, operating margins will likely be slightly lower than in 2016 due to potential increases in petroleum-based input and construction labor costs, especially in North America. We are employing continuous improvement processes in our CIPP manufacturing and operations to partially offset these expected cost headwinds.\nCorrosion Protection\nWe expect a modest recovery in 2017 from the impact caused by depressed oil prices over the last two years, which will be aided by the anticipated completion of a $130 million deepwater pipe coating and insulation project.\nOver 50 percent of Corrosion Protection's revenues come from cathodic protection services for midstream oil and gas pipelines in North America, an attractive and growing market that we believe justifies further investment to outpace market growth. To that end, we plan to roll out a new asset integrity management program in 2017 for pipeline corrosion inspections. The new service will improve data accuracy and processing efficiency, customize the data transfer format (including geospatial mapping) and provide faster access to the information by customers. Corrosion Protection's pipeline inspection services are expected to create a multiplier effect for our other capabilities in direct pipeline inspections, engineering, cathodic protection system installation and pipeline corrosion remediation. Our objective is to expand the relationships with our top customers, who are the leading pipeline owners in North America, to accelerate revenue growth. Asset integrity management is an important element of that strategy and we expect to transition a number of those customers to the new system in 2017.\nWith oil prices trading in a stable range since the fall of 2016, we have responded to more customer inquiries for our Tite Liner\u00ae lining pipeline protection system, pipe coatings and insulation for the United States Gulf Coast region and field pipe coatings domestically and overseas. We are encouraged by the growing customer interest and believe this can lead to a modestly improved energy market in 2017, especially in North America. The planned contribution from the deepwater project and anticipated modest recovery in the energy markets establishes our Corrosion Protection expectations for mid-teens revenue growth and mid-single digit operating margins in 2017. The outlook is in line with the three-year targets for revenue growth and operating margin expansion.\nEnergy Services\nWe expect Energy Services to build on the momentum achieved in the second half of 2016 after completing the downsizing of its upstream operations in Central California and the Permian Basin as part of the 2016 Restructuring. The outlook for day-to-day downstream refinery maintenance remains robust based on long-term contracts and our position as the lead maintenance provider in 13 out of the 17 refineries on the United States West Coast. We have an effort underway to expand our services to those customers in mechanical maintenance, turnaround support, electrical and instrumentation maintenance and small capital construction activities. We also expect growth in 2017 from a greater number of turnaround, or refinery shutdown, activities. We will continue to improve operating efficiencies to maximize margins and cash generation. The favorable outlook we expect in 2017 supports low to mid-single digit revenue growth and operating margins above the results achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAcquisitions/Strategic Initiatives/Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nOur recent acquisition strategy has focused on the world's aging infrastructure and the investment needed to maintain infrastructure in North America and overseas. During 2016, we targeted strategic acquisitions in the infrastructure sector by:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>i.\n</td> <td>adding patented Fusible PVC\u00ae pipe technology to our pressure pipe rehabilitation portfolio through the acquisition of Underground Solutions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ii.\n</td> <td>expanding our CIPP presence in Europe by acquiring the CIPP contracting operations of LMJ, a Danish company;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>iii.\n</td> <td>gaining worldwide rights to market, manufacture and install the patented Tyfo\u00ae Fibrwrap\u00ae FRP technology by acquiring Fyfe Europe; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>iv.\n</td> <td>expanding our FRP presence in Asia through the acquisition of Concrete Solutions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for additional information and disclosures regarding our acquisitions.\n2016 Restructuring\nDuring 2016, we completed our 2016 Restructuring, which (i) repositioned Energy Services' upstream operations in California, (ii) reduced Corrosion Protection's upstream exposure by divesting our interest in Bayou Perma-Pipe Canada, Ltd. ( BPPC\u201d), our Canadian pipe coating joint venture, (iii) right-sized Corrosion Protection to compete more effectively and (iv) reduced corporate and other operating costs. The 2016 Restructuring reduced consolidated annual costs by approximately $17.4 million, of which approximately $1.2 million, $6.6 million and $5.6 million related to recognized savings within Infrastructure Solutions, Corrosion Protection and Energy Services, respectively, and $4.0 million related to reduced corporate costs. Cost savings were achieved primarily through office closures and reducing headcount by approximately 964 employees, or 15.5% of our total workforce as of December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2016, we recorded pre-tax charges of $16.1 million ($10.3 million after tax), most of which were cash charges, consisting primarily of employee severance and benefits, early lease termination and other costs associated with the restructuring efforts as described above. We do not expect to incur any future charges related to the 2016 Restructuring.\n2014 Restructuring\nThe 2014 Restructuring generated annual operating cost savings of approximately $10.8 million and consisted of approximately $8.4 million and $2.4 million of recognized savings within Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection, respectively. We achieved these cost savings by (i) exiting certain unprofitable international locations for our CIPP business and consolidating our worldwide FRP business with the global CIPP business, all of which is in Infrastructure Solutions; and (ii) eliminating certain idle facilities in our pipe coating and insulation operation in Louisiana, which is in Corrosion Protection.\nWe have substantially completed all of the aforementioned objectives related to the 2014 Restructuring. Total headcount reductions were 86 as of December 31, 2016 and total pre-tax 2014 Restructuring charges since inception were $60.3 million ($44.8 million after tax) and consisted of non-cash charges totaling $48.3 million and cash charges totaling $12.0 million. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for additional information on the charges related to the 2014 Restructuring. Remaining headcount reductions and cash costs related to the 2014 Restructuring are not expected to be material. We expect to incur additional non-cash charges in 2017, primarily related to the potential release of cumulative currency translation adjustments resulting from the restructured locations as well as the foreign currency impact from settlement of inter-company loans. All such charges will be recognized in Infrastructure Solutions.\nSee Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions and strategic initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nIn 2016, Infrastructure Solutions experienced increased revenues and profitability due to favorable market conditions primarily in our CIPP business in North America. In February 2016, we added Fusible PVC\u00ae to our pressure pipe rehabilitation portfolio through the acquisition of Underground Solutions.\nEnergy Services and Corrosion Protection continued to experience upstream, and to a lesser extent midstream, market challenges as a result of low oil prices. In response to these market challenges, we successfully executed our 2016 Restructuring which included cost reductions, mainly from employee headcount reductions and office closures, and the divestiture of our Canadian joint venture interest in BPPC.\nSignificant Events\n2016 Restructuring - As part of the 2016 Restructuring, we recorded pre-tax charges of $16.1 million ($10.3 million post-tax) during 2016 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\n2014 Restructuring - As part of the 2014 Restructuring, we recorded pre-tax charges (credits) of $(0.2) million ($(0.1) million post-tax), $11.0 million ($8.7 million post-tax) and $26.7 million ($22.5 million post-tax) during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These charges exclude long-lived asset impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2014 for the Bayou, Europe and Asia-Pacific reporting units noted below. Including those charges, total 2014 Restructuring pre-tax charges were $49.5 million ($36.2 million post-tax) in 2014 (see Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\nImpairment of goodwill - We recorded pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $43.5 million ($35.7 million post-tax) and $51.5 million ($45.8 million post-tax) during 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report). These charges were recorded as follows:\nEnergy Services Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $33.5 million. In response to contract losses in the Central California upstream energy market during the fourth quarter of 2015 and our subsequent decision to reduce exposure to the upstream market, we performed a market assessment of our energy-related businesses and concluded that sustained low oil prices will continue to create market challenges for the foreseeable future, including a continued reduction in spending by certain of our customers in 2016. The loss of contracts, coupled with the decision to downsize, caused us to perform an interim impairment review of the goodwill and long-lived assets of our operations affected by these circumstances. As a result of the review, we determined that goodwill was impaired; however, there were no impairment charges related to long-lived assets. The Energy Services reporting unit is included in the Energy Services reportable segment.\nCRTS Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash charges of $10.0 million and $5.7 million, respectively. For both periods, we performed an impairment review for goodwill and long-lived assets as a result of customer-driven work delays, work order cancellations and canceled sales opportunities as a result of declining oil prices. In 2015, the impairment resulted from our annual assessment of goodwill. In 2014, the impairment resulted from an interim impairment review. For each period, we determined that goodwill was impaired; however, there were no impairment charges related to long-lived assets in either period. The CRTS reporting unit is included in the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.\nBayou Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $29.7 million. We performed an interim impairment review of Bayou's goodwill as a result of customer-driven work delays, work order cancellations and canceled sales opportunities stemming from declining oil prices. As a result of our review, we determined that goodwill was impaired. The Bayou reporting unit is included in the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.\nFyfe Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $16.1 million as part of our annual impairment assessment for goodwill. Fair value had fallen due to lower long-term expectations for the Fyfe businesses, primarily in North America. As a result of our assessment, we determined that goodwill was impaired. The Fyfe reporting unit is included in the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment.\nImpairment of long-lived assets - During 2014, we recorded pre-tax, non-cash long-lived asset impairment charges of $24.0 million ($14.5 million post-tax) (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report). These charges were recorded as follows:\nBayou, Europe and Asia-Pacific Reporting Units - In the third quarter of 2014, as part of our 2014 Restructuring, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment impairment charges of $11.9 million related to (i) our Bayou and Bayou Delta asset groups within our Bayou reporting unit, (ii) our France asset group within our Europe reporting unit, and (iii) our Malaysia and India asset groups within our Asia-Pacific reporting unit. We\nevaluated the property and equipment of our global operations affected by the 2014 Restructuring and determined that these asset groups were impaired. The Europe and Asia-Pacific reporting units and their related assets groups are included in the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment. Also included in the impairment assessment were Bayou-related intangible assets such as tradenames and customer relationships that were also tested on an undiscounted cash flow basis. Based on the results of the valuation, the carrying amount of the customer relationship intangible asset at Bayou exceeded the fair value and resulted in a full impairment as of September 30, 2014. Accordingly, we recorded a $10.9 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2014.\nFyfe Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $1.2 million as a result of our annual impairment assessment for goodwill. During the goodwill assessment, the Fyfe reporting unit had a fair value below its carrying value, which caused us to perform an impairment review of long-lived assets. As a result of our review, we determined that the customer relationship intangible asset related to our Fyfe Latin America asset group had been fully impaired.\nBrinderson escrow settlement - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we finalized the settlement ( Brinderson escrow settlement\u201d) of negotiated working capital for the Brinderson acquisition in 2013 as well as escrow claims made pursuant to the purchase agreement. As a result of the settlement, we received proceeds of approximately $5.5 million, $1.0 million of which was recorded as a purchase price adjustment related to working capital, and the remaining $4.5 million was recorded as an offset to operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Brinderson is reported in the Energy Services reportable segment.\nLegal settlement - In December 2016, we settled two lawsuits related to the December 2012 departure of several key leaders in sales and operations for the Tyfo\u00ae Fibrwrap\u00ae technology, which is part of the Infrastructure Solutions platform. Under the settlement, we will receive $6.6 million; and accordingly, recorded the gain to Gain on litigation settlement\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The initial $3.6 million cash payment was received in December 2016 and the remainder is to be paid in $750,000 installments over the next four years.\nDivestitures - In December 2015, we recognized a loss of $0.6 million related to the sale of our 51% joint venture interest in BPPC, which transaction closed in February 2016 (see Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\nIn March 2014, we recognized a loss of $0.5 million related to the sale of our 49% joint venture interest in Bayou Coating.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report.\nOperating Results\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

8.4%, to $1,221.9 million in 2016 compared to $1,333.6 million in 2015. The decrease in revenues was due to a $90.5 million decline in Energy Services' revenues primarily resulting from our first quarter 2016 decision to downsize our exposure to the upstream energy market due to the effects of lower oil prices and a decrease in refinery clean-up, construction and turnaround activities. Revenues in Corrosion Protection decreased $36.4 million mainly due to (i) a decrease in Canadian upstream, and to a lesser extent midstream, project activity attributable to a decline in client spending on crude oil projects as well as a $25.3 million revenue decline associated with the sale of our Canadian pipe coating joint venture interest in February 2016, (ii) a decrease in domestic upstream project activity and (iii) the completion of certain large international projects performed primarily in 2015 and completed in early 2016. Revenues in Infrastructure Solutions increased $15.3 million primarily due to our acquisition of Underground Solutions in February 2016 and an increase in CIPP contracting installation services activity in North America, partially offset by decreases in FRP project activity in North America and international CIPP contracting installation services activity. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated revenues, as well as individual segment revenues, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit decreased $22.6 million, or 8.2%, to $253.2 million in 2016 compared to $275.8 million in 2015. As part of the 2016 Restructuring and 2014 Restructuring, we recognized charges totaling $0.3 million and $2.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges, gross profit decreased $25.0 million, or 9.0%, to $253.5 million in 2016 compared to $278.5 million in 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a $10.0 million decrease in Corrosion Protection and a $14.5 million decrease in Energy Services primarily due to declines in revenues, as noted above, and added costs associated with certain challenging international projects in Corrosion Protection. Gross profit in Infrastructure Solutions increased $1.8 million largely driven by an increase in CIPP contracting installation services activity in North America and the contribution from Underground Solutions, partially offset by a decline in emergency large diameter pressure pipe projects in our North American FRP business. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated gross profit, as well as individual segment gross profit, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nGross profit margin remained consistent at 20.7% in 2016 and 2015. Excluding restructuring charges, gross profit margin declined 20 basis points to 20.7% in 2016 from 20.9% in 2015. Gross profit margin declined primarily due to the negative impacts from challenging upstream energy market conditions in Corrosion Protection and decreased labor and equipment utilization in our international CIPP operations in Infrastructure Solutions, partially offset by the higher margin contribution from Infrastructure Solutions' Underground Solutions business and improved margins in Energy Services.\nSee Segment Results below for broader discussion regarding changes in gross profit and gross profit margin by segment.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $12.4 million, or 5.9%, to $197.1 million in 2016 compared to $209.5 million in 2015. As part of the 2016 Restructuring and 2014 Restructuring, we recognized charges of $6.2 million and $4.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2015, we recorded a loss reserve of $2.9 million related to a long-dated accounts receivable in Corrosion Protection and a loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in Infrastructure Solutions. Excluding restructuring charges and noted loss reserves, operating expenses decreased $8.5 million, or 4.3%, to $190.9 million in 2016 compared to $199.4 million in 2015.\nThe decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to our restructuring efforts, which generated cost savings mainly in Energy Services' upstream operation and Corrosion Protection's upstream and midstream operations. Included in the decrease in operating expenses was an offset to operating expenses related to favorable reductions in reserves for certain Brinderson pre-acquisition matters in Energy Services and a decrease related to the sale of our Canadian pipe coating operation in Corrosion Protection. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating expenses was an increase in Infrastructure Solutions primarily related to the acquisition of Underground Solutions. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated operating expenses, as well as individual segment operating expenses, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 16.1% and 15.7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges and loss reserves noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.6% and 15.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations\nConsolidated income from continuing operations increased $37.2 million, or 465.0%, to $29.2 million in 2016, from a consolidated loss of $8.0 million in 2015.\nIncluded in consolidated income from continuing operations were the following pre-tax items: (i) 2016 Restructuring and 2014 Restructuring charges of $15.9 million ($10.2 million post-tax) and $11.0 million ($8.7 million post-tax) in 2016 and 2015, respectively, (ii) goodwill impairment charges of $43.5 million ($35.7 million post-tax) in 2015, (iii) loss reserves of $2.9 million ($2.0 million post-tax) in 2015 related to long-dated accounts receivable, (iv) a loss reserve of $2.8 million ($1.7 million post-tax) related to a legal matter in 2015, (v) gain on a litigation settlement of $6.6 million ($4.0 million post-tax) in 2016, (vi) the loss on the sale of BPPC of $0.6 million ($0.4 million post-tax) in 2015 and (vii) acquisition-related expenses of $2.7 million ($2.2 million post-tax) and $1.9 million ($1.2 million post-tax) in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nExcluding the above items, consolidated income from continuing operations decreased $8.2 million, or 17.8%, to $37.9 million in 2016 from $46.1 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to declining revenues and gross profit related to the negative impacts from the low oil price environment in Energy Services and Corrosion Protection, partially offset by an increase in revenues and gross profit in Infrastructure Solutions. Operating expenses favorably impacted consolidated income as a result of operating expense savings associated with our restructuring efforts and decreases in reserves for certain Brinderson pre-acquisition matters noted above, partially offset by the operating expense contribution from Underground Solutions. Consolidated income from continuing operations in 2016, as compared to 2015, was negatively impacted by an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowing costs and higher debt balances, but positively benefited from the $4.2 million reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance due to changes in the realization of future tax benefits. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated income from continuing operations in 2016 compared to 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $2.1 million, or 0.2%, to $1,333.6 million in 2015 compared to $1,331.4 million in 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily due to increased maintenance and turnaround services activity in our downstream operation within Energy Services, increased North American CIPP contracting installation services activity within Infrastructure Solutions, and increased project activity in our pipe coating and insulation operation in Louisiana within Corrosion Protection. Partially offsetting the increase in revenues were negative impacts from foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar which equated to a $51.8 million decline in revenues in 2015 compared to 2014. Revenues also declined as a result of our 2014 Restructuring as we exited or were in the process of exiting, certain under-performing operations located in European and Asia-Pacific regions in 2015. Additionally, revenues declined in our upstream and midstream oil and gas operations within Energy Services and Corrosion Protection.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit decreased $4.2 million, or 1.5%, to $275.8 million in 2015 compared to $280.0 million in 2014. Excluding 2014 Restructuring charges of $2.7 million and $4.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, within Infrastructure Solutions and long-lived asset impairment charges of $11.3 million in 2014 within Corrosion Protection, gross profit decreased $17.2 million, or 5.8%, to $278.5 million in 2015 compared to $295.7 million in 2014.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross profit by $10.6 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nGross profit margin declined 30 basis points to 20.7% in 2015 from 21.0% in 2014. Excluding 2014 Restructuring charges and long-lived asset impairment charges noted above, gross profit margin declined 130 basis points to 20.9% in 2015 from 22.2% in 2014.\nSee Segment Results below for broader discussion regarding changes in gross profit and gross profit margin by segment.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $24.6 million, or 10.5%, to $209.5 million in 2015 compared to $234.1 million in 2014. In 2015, we recorded a loss reserve of $2.9 million related to a long-dated accounts receivable in Corrosion Protection and a loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in Infrastructure Solutions. In 2014, we recorded a loss reserve of $7.5 million related to a disputed and long-dated accounts receivable in Infrastructure Solutions and an offset to operating expenses of $4.5 million related to the Brinderson escrow settlement in Energy Services. Excluding (i) the loss reserves of $2.9 million and $7.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (ii) the loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in 2015, (iii) the Brinderson escrow settlement offset of $4.5 million in 2014, and (iv) 2014 Restructuring charges of $4.4 million and $20.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, within Infrastructure Solutions; operating expenses decreased $11.2 million, or 5.3%, to $199.4 million in 2015 compared to $210.6 million in 2014.\nThe decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of cost savings achieved in our European, Asia-Pacific and North American operations as part of the 2014 Restructuring, as well as favorable impacts from foreign currency rates in\nrelation to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, operating expenses in Corrosion Protection decreased as a result of controlled spending efforts in our operations servicing the upstream market given the challenging market conditions. Partially offsetting these decreasing factors was an increase in operating expenses related to additional staff to support growth in the downstream refining market serviced by Energy Services.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted operating expenses by $4.7 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.7% and 17.6% in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Excluding the loss reserve for long-dated accounts receivable, the Brinderson escrow settlement and the 2014 Restructuring charges as noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.0% and 15.8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations was $8.0 million in 2015, an improvement of $23.6 million, or 74.7%, from a consolidated loss of $31.6 million in 2014.\nIncluded in consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations were the following pre-tax items: (i) 2014 Restructuring charges of $11.0 million ($8.7 million post-tax) and $26.7 million ($22.5 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (ii) goodwill impairment charges of $43.5 million ($35.7 million post-tax) and $51.5 million ($45.8 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (iii) definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $24.0 million ($14.5 million post-tax) in 2014, (iv) loss reserves of $2.9 million ($2.0 million post-tax) and $7.5 million ($4.5 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to long-dated accounts receivable, (v) a loss reserve of $2.8 million ($1.7 million post-tax) related to a legal matter in 2015, (vi) Brinderson escrow settlement gain of $4.5 million ($2.8 million post-tax) in 2014, (vii) the loss on the sale of BPPC of $0.6 million ($0.4 million post-tax) in 2015 and (viii) acquisition-related expenses of $1.9 million ($1.2 million post-tax) and $1.4 million ($0.8 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nExcluding the above items, consolidated income from continuing operations was $46.1 million in 2015, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 13.3%, from $53.1 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the decline in project activities in our upstream, and to a lesser extent midstream, operations within Corrosion Protection and Energy Services, which were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in oil prices during the second half of 2014 and reduced customer spending. Partially offsetting the decrease in consolidated income from continuing operations was an increase in CIPP contracting installation services activity in Infrastructure Solutions and increased customer demand for services provided by our downstream operation in Energy Services.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted consolidated income from continuing operations by $4.2 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nContract Backlog\nContract backlog is our expectation of revenues to be generated from received, signed and uncompleted contracts, the cancellation of which is not anticipated at the time of reporting. We assume these signed contracts are funded. For government or municipal contracts, our customers generally obtain funding through local budgets or pre-approved bond financing. We have not undertaken a process to verify funding status of these contracts and, therefore, cannot reasonably estimate what portion, if any, of contracts in backlog have not been funded. However, we have little history of signed contracts being canceled due to the lack of funding. Contract backlog excludes any term contract amounts for which there are not specific and determinable work releases and projects where we have been advised that we are the low bidder, but have not formally been awarded the contract.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated backlog by segment for each of the last three years (in millions):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infrastructure Solutions (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>311.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corrosion Protection (2)\n</td> <td>213.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy Services (3)\n</td> <td>192.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total backlog\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>689.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>776.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included backlog from restructured entities of zero, $0.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016 and 2015 included backlog from our large domestic pipe coating and insulation contract of $96.8 million and $134.3 million, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included upstream-related backlog of $29.8 million, $41.1 million and $96.5 million, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Included within backlog for Energy Services are amounts that represent expected revenues to be realized under long-term Master Service Agreements ( MSAs\u201d) and other signed contracts. If the remaining term of these arrangements exceeds 12 months, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such arrangements included in backlog are limited to only the next 12 months of expected revenues. Although backlog represents only those contracts and MSAs that are considered to be firm, there can be no assurance that cancellation or scope adjustments will not occur with respect to such contracts.\nWithin our Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection segments, certain contracts are performed through our variable interest entities, in which we own a controlling portion of the entity. As of December 31, 2016, 1.2% and 29.8% of our Infrastructure Solutions backlog and Corrosion Protection backlog, respectively, related to these variable interest entities. With the exception of Energy Services, a substantial majority of our contracts in these two segments are fixed price contracts with individual private businesses and municipal and federal government entities across the world. Energy Services, on the other hand, generally enters into cost reimbursable contracts that are based on costs incurred at agreed upon contractual rates.\nIn accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the customer. In a situation where a customer terminates a contract, we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and, in certain circumstances, we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs. There were no significant cancellations in 2016.\nWhile management uses all information available to it to determine backlog, our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Accordingly, backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues.\nTotal contract backlog decreased $86.9 million, or 11.2%, to $689.6 million at December 31, 2016 from $776.5 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in backlog was due to several factors, including (i) work performed during 2016 on the large domestic pipe coating and insulation contract included in backlog at December 31, 2015 within Corrosion Protection ; (ii) the 2016 completion of large coating services projects in the Middle East and South America within Corrosion Protection; (iii) the 2016 completion of large projects in our other pipe coating and insulation operations within Corrosion Protection; and (iv) record 2016 revenues and the timing of awards in our North American CIPP operations within Infrastructure Solutions. Partially offsetting the decrease in total backlog was an increase in cathodic protection awards, primarily in the United States, within Corrosion Protection, and the increases within Infrastructure Solutions attributable to Underground Solutions, LMJ and Concrete Solutions, which were acquired in 2016. Energy Services overall backlog remained unchanged, however, declines related to upstream activities were largely offset by more activity in the downstream market boosted by the renewal of a large maintenance contract in December 2016. A higher and more stable oil price environment has the potential for customers to increase spending on pipeline assets. In the event crude oil prices remain depressed, however, our outlook and contract backlog could continue to be be negatively impacted. Market conditions continue to be favorable across most geographies for Infrastructure Solutions as municipal spending activity generally remains strong as a result of steady local economies and increased environmental enforcement.\nSubject to factors discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d, we estimate that approximately $677.7 million, or 98.3%, of total backlog at December 31, 2016 will be realized as revenues in 2017.\nSegment Results\nInfrastructure Solutions Segment\nKey financial data for Infrastructure Solutions was as follows:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>571,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>556,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>567,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,971\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>141,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>89,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,451\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Definite-lived intangible asset impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,220\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on litigation settlement\n</td> <td>(6,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expenses\n</td> <td>2,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>2,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>53,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,194\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(856.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>950\n</td> <td>bp\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________\nN/A\u201d represents not applicable.\nN/M\u201d represents not meaningful.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenues\nRevenues in Infrastructure Solutions increased $15.3 million, or 2.8%, to $571.6 million in 2016 compared to $556.2 million in 2015. As part of the 2014 Restructuring, we exited certain foreign operations primarily in 2015. Excluding revenues from restructured operations, revenues in Infrastructure Solutions increased $23.3 million, or 4.3%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the $29.4 million contribution from Underground Solutions, which was acquired in February 2016, and record revenues in our North American CIPP operation. Revenues in our European operation increased primarily due to the $4.9 million contribution from LMJ, which was acquired in June 2016. Partially offsetting the increase in revenues was a decrease in FRP project activity in North America compared to 2015, which included the completion of a large industrial project that was performed and completed in 2015, and a decrease in CIPP project activity in our Asia-Pacific operation.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit in Infrastructure Solutions increased $1.8 million, or 1.3%, to $141.7 million in 2016 compared to $139.9 million in 2015. As part of the 2014 Restructuring, we recognized charges of $0.1 million and $2.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to costs associated with the exiting of certain foreign locations. Excluding restructuring charges, gross profit decreased $0.9 million, or 0.6%, to $141.7 million in 2016 compared to $142.6 million in 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to: (i) a decline in emergency large diameter pressure pipe activity in our North American FRP business, (ii) a decline in CIPP contracting installation services activity in our Asia-Pacific operation primarily related to project execution, (iii) a decline in gross profit in our European operation primarily due to lower labor and equipment utilization, and (iv) an expense of $3.6 million in the first half of 2016 for the recognition of inventory step up related to the Underground Solutions acquisition. Substantially offsetting the decrease in gross profit were increases in our North American operation, which included the contribution from Underground Solutions and increased CIPP contracting installation services activity.\nGross profit margin declined 40 basis points to 24.8% in 2016 from 25.2% in 2015. Excluding restructuring charges, gross profit margin declined 80 basis points to 24.8% in 2016 from 25.6% in 2015. Gross profit margin declined mainly as a result of a decline in FRP project activity in our North American operation and, to a lesser extent, lower labor and equipment utilization in our European and Asia-Pacific CIPP operations. Partially offsetting the decline in gross profit margin were increases related to higher margin project activity in Underground Solutions and greater efficiencies in CIPP project activity in our North American operation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in Infrastructure Solutions decreased $1.5 million, or 1.6%, to $89.5 million in 2016 compared to $90.9 million 2015. As part of the 2016 Restructuring, we recognized charges totaling $0.6 million in 2016 related to cost reduction efforts. As part of the 2014 Restructuring, we recognized expense reversals totaling $0.3 million and charges totaling $4.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, associated with the exiting of certain foreign locations. In 2015, we recorded a loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter. Excluding restructuring charges and the loss reserve for the legal matter in 2015, operating expenses increased $5.4 million, or 6.5%, to $89.2 million in 2016 compared to $83.8 million in 2015. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the contribution from Underground Solutions since its acquisition in February 2016 and, to a lesser extent, operating expense contributions related to the acquisitions of LMJ, Concrete Solutions and Fyfe Europe in 2016. Partially offsetting the increase in operating expenses were decreases related to cost savings in our FRP and CIPP operations in North America.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.7% and 16.3% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges and the loss reserve noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.6% and 15.1% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\nOperating income in Infrastructure Solutions increased $6.6 million, or 14.2%, to $53.5 million in 2016 compared to $46.9 million in 2015. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 9.4% in 2016 compared to 8.4% in 2015.\nIncluded in operating income were the following pre-tax items: (i) gain on litigation settlement of $6.6 million related to our FRP business in North America, (ii) 2016 Restructuring charges of $3.1 million primarily related to severance, extension of benefits, employee assistance programs, wind-down and other restructuring costs in 2016, (iii) 2014 Restructuring expense reversals of $0.2 million in 2016 and charges of $8.1 million in 2015, (iv) inventory step-up expense of $3.6 million associated with the acquisition of Underground Solutions, (v) acquisition-related expenses of $2.7 million and $1.1 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and (vi) a loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in 2015.\nExcluding the above items, operating income decreased $2.8 million, or 4.7%, to $56.1 million in 2016 compared to $58.8 million in 2015 and operating margin declined 80 basis points to 9.8% in 2016 from 10.6% in 2015. These decreases were primarily driven by a decline in FRP project activity in North America, a decline in profitability in our European operation related to lower labor and equipment utilization, and a decline in CIPP contracting installation services activity in Asia-Pacific mainly due to delays in project timing. Partially offsetting the decreases in operating income and operating margin were increases primarily related to our North American operation, which benefited from increased CIPP contracting installation services activity, improved efficiencies and the contribution from Underground Solutions. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on operating income in 2016 compared to 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues in Infrastructure Solutions decreased $11.0 million, or 1.9%, to $556.2 million in 2015 from $567.2 million in 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily the result of negative impacts from foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar, which equated to a $22.3 million decline in revenues in 2015 compared to 2014. Revenues also declined as a result of our 2014 Restructuring as we exited, or were in the process of exiting, certain under-performing operations located in the European and Asia-Pacific regions in 2015. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenues was an increase related to growth in CIPP contracting installation services activity in our North American operation. Our North American operation benefited in 2015 from an increased backlog primarily due to favorable market conditions and improved market share.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit in Infrastructure Solutions increased $4.0 million, or 3.0%, to $139.9 million in 2015 compared to $135.9 million in 2014. Excluding 2014 Restructuring charges of $2.7 million and $4.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, gross profit increased $2.4 million, or 1.7%, to $142.6 million in 2015 compared to $140.2 million in 2014. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased revenues in our North American operation, supply cost savings related to resin, fuel and fiber costs as a result of lower commodity prices in 2015 compared to 2014, and improved project execution. Partially offsetting the increase in gross profit was a decrease related to a decline in CIPP contracting installation services activity in our European operation, which was part of the 2014 Restructuring. The change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross profit for the segment by $4.6 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nGross profit margin improved 120 basis points to 25.2% in 2015 from 24.0% in 2014. Excluding 2014 Restructuring charges, gross profit margin improved 90 basis points to 25.6% in 2015 from 24.7% in 2014. The increase in gross profit\nmargin was primarily due to efficiencies, cost saving efforts, including cost savings from our 2014 Restructuring, and lower supply costs within our North American, European and Asia-Pacific operations.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in Infrastructure Solutions decreased $33.2 million, or 26.7%, to $90.9 million in 2015 compared to $124.1 million 2014. In 2015, we recorded a loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter. In 2014, we recorded a loss reserve of $7.5 million within operating expenses related to disputed and long-dated accounts receivables. Excluding (i) the loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in 2015, (ii) the loss reserve of $7.5 million in 2014, and (iii) 2014 Restructuring charges of $4.4 million and $20.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively; operating expenses decreased $12.3 million, or 12.8%, to $83.8 million in 2015 compared to $96.1 million in 2014. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of cost savings achieved in our European, Asia-Pacific and North American operations as part of the 2014 Restructuring, partially offset by increased information technology investments and other costs allocated from our corporate administrative function. The change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted operating expenses for the segment by $2.5 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 16.3% and 21.9% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding the loss reserves and 2014 Restructuring charges as noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.1% and 16.9% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Income (Loss) and Operating Margin\nOperating income in Infrastructure Solutions increased $53.1 million, or 856.6%, to $46.9 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $6.2 million in 2014. Operating margin increased 950 basis points to 8.4% in 2015 from (1.1)% in 2014.\nIncluded in operating income (loss) were the following pre-tax items: (i) 2014 Restructuring charges of $8.1 million and $25.6 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (ii) loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in 2015, (iii) loss reserve related to a disputed and long-dated accounts receivable of $7.5 million in 2014, (iv) goodwill impairment charges of $16.1 million in 2014, (v) definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $1.2 million in 2014, and (vi) acquisition-related expenses of $1.1 million in 2015.\nExcluding the above items, operating income increased $14.7 million, or 33.3%, to $58.8 million in 2015 compared to $44.1 million in 2014 and operating margin improved 280 basis points to 10.6% in 2015 from 7.8% in 2014. These increases were primarily the result of cost savings achieved in our European, Asia-Pacific and North American operations as part of the 2014 Restructuring, supply cost savings and improved project execution. The change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted operating income for the segment by $2.0 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nCorrosion Protection Segment\nKey financial data for Corrosion Protection was as follows:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>401,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,452\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,488\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>83,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,951\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60\n</td> <td>)bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>77,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,920\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,486\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Definite-lived intangible asset impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,896\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expenses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(457\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>3,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>1,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,771\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,010\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640\n</td> <td>bp\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________\nN/A\u201d represents not applicable.\nN/M\u201d represents not meaningful.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenues\nRevenues in Corrosion Protection decreased $36.5 million, or 8.3%, to $401.5 million in 2016 compared to $437.9 million in 2015. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a $43.2 million decline in revenues generated from our Canadian operations, which included a $25.3 million decline related to the sale of our Canadian pipe coating operation in February 2016, as weak Canadian market conditions negatively impacted our cathodic protection and industrial linings operations. Also contributing to the decrease in revenues was a decline in project activities in the Middle East primarily in our cathodic protection and industrial linings operations and the completion of a large coating services project in South America. Partially offsetting the decreases in revenues were increases primarily related to production on a large domestic project in our pipe coating and insulation operation, increased project activities in our domestic and European cathodic protection operations and increased project activities in our coating services operation in the Middle East.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit in Corrosion Protection decreased $10.0 million, or 10.7%, to $83.3 million in 2016 compared to $93.2 million in 2015. As part of the 2016 Restructuring, we recognized charges of $0.3 million in 2016 related to the downsizing of certain upstream and midstream operations. Excluding restructuring charges, gross profit decreased $9.7 million, or 10.4%. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a $11.7 million decline in gross profit generated from our Canadian operations, which included a $4.7 million decline related to the sale of our Canadian pipe coating operation, as project activity in Canada declined as noted above. Also contributing to the decrease in gross profit were added costs on certain challenging coating services projects in the Middle East and a large coating services project in South America performed mostly in 2015 and completed in early 2016. Partially offsetting the decreases in gross profit were increases primarily related to production on a large domestic project in our pipe coating and insulation operation, increased project activities in our domestic as well as European cathodic protection operation and increased project activities in our domestic industrial linings operation. Improved efficiencies resulting from our 2016 Restructuring efforts also led to higher gross profit generated in our cathodic protection operation.\nGross profit margin declined 60 basis points to 20.7% in 2016 from 21.3% in 2015. Excluding 2016 Restructuring charges, gross profit margin declined 50 basis points in 2016 from 2015. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to added costs on certain coating services projects in the Middle East as well as lower labor and equipment utilization in our Canadian operations. Partially offsetting the decrease in gross profit margin were increases primarily related to production on a large domestic project with a higher margin profile in our pipe coating and insulation operation, higher margin work in our domestic industrial linings operation and improved efficiencies resulting from our 2016 Restructuring efforts in our cathodic protection operation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in Corrosion Protection decreased $6.9 million, or 8.2%, to $77.7 million in 2016 compared to $84.6 million in 2015. Excluding 2016 Restructuring charges of $0.5 million related to the downsizing of certain midstream and upstream operations in 2016 and loss reserves of $2.9 million related to long-dated accounts receivable in 2015, operating expenses decreased $4.5 million, or 5.5%, to $77.2 million in 2016 compared to $81.7 million in 2015. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to cost savings associated with our 2016 Restructuring and other controlled spending efforts in a period of declining revenues. Also contributing to the decrease in operating expenses was $1.6 million related to the sale of our Canadian pipe coating operation.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 19.3% and 19.3% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding 2016 Restructuring charges and the loss reserves in 2015, as noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 19.2% and 18.7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Income (Loss) and Operating Margin\nOperating income in Corrosion Protection increased $3.6 million, or 202.1%, to $1.8 million in 2016 compared to a loss of $1.8 million in 2015. Operating margin improved 90 basis points to 0.5% in 2016 compared to (0.4)% in 2015.\nIncluded in operating income (loss) were the following pre-tax items: (i) 2016 Restructuring charges of $4.6 million related to employee severance, retention, extension of benefits, employee assistance programs, wind-down and other restructuring costs related to the downsizing of certain of our upstream operations in 2016, (ii) goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 million in 2015, (iii) loss reserve of $2.9 million related to a long-dated accounts receivable in 2015, and (iv) acquisition-related expenses of $0.5 million in 2015.\nExcluding the above items, operating income decreased $5.2 million, or 44.7%, to $6.4 million in 2016 compared to $11.5 million in 2015 and operating margin declined 100 basis points to 1.6% in 2016 from 2.6% in 2015. These decreases were primarily due to declining revenues and gross profit, as noted above, partially offset by operating expense savings primarily\ngenerated from cost saving initiatives associated with the 2016 Restructuring. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on operating income in 2016 compared to 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues in Corrosion Protection decreased $20.5 million, or 4.5%, to $437.9 million in 2015 compared to $458.4 million in 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily the result of negative impacts from foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar, which equated to a $29.6 million decline in revenues in 2015 compared to 2014. Revenues also declined due to decreased project activity in our industrial linings operation, our cathodic protection operation and our Canadian pipe coating operation mainly due to challenging market conditions. These challenges were the result of decreased customer spending and customer driven delays in project start dates, particularly as it relates to our businesses tied to the upstream, and to a lesser extent midstream, energy markets, which were negatively impacted by lower oil prices. Partially offsetting the decreases in revenues were increases primarily related to project activity in our pipe coating and insulation operation and our coating services operation, the later of which benefited from a large project in South America.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit in Corrosion Protection decreased $6.1 million, or 6.1%, to $93.2 million in 2015 compared to $99.3 million in 2014. In 2014, as part of our 2014 Restructuring, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $11.3 million related to certain fixed assets in our pipe coating and insulation operation in Louisiana. Excluding long-lived asset impairment charges, gross profit decreased $17.4 million, or 15.7%, to $93.2 million in 2015 compared to $110.6 million in 2014. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to (i) a decline in revenues in our cathodic protection operation, our industrial linings operation and our Canadian pipe coating operation mainly due to challenging market conditions noted previously, (ii) a shift in higher margin offshore work to lower margin onshore work in our coating services operation, (iii) lower labor and equipment utilization in our cathodic protection operation as projects were delayed or canceled, thereby making it increasingly difficult to remain efficient, and (iv) impacts from unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting the decrease in gross profit were improved results in our domestic pipe coating and insulation operation and our Canadian cathodic protection operation, notwithstanding unfavorable foreign currency rates between the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar in 2015.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross profit for the segment by $6.1 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nGross profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 21.3% in 2015 from 21.7% in 2014. Excluding long-lived asset impairment charges in 2014, gross profit margin decreased 280 basis points to 21.3% in 2015 from 24.1% in 2014. The decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the same factors impacting gross profit as noted above with the primary driver being the shift in higher margin offshore work to lower margin onshore work in our coating services operation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in Corrosion Protection increased $1.3 million, or 1.6%, to $84.6 million in 2015 compared to $83.3 million in 2014 primarily due to a loss reserve of $2.9 million recorded in 2015 related to a long-dated accounts receivable. Additionally, operating expenses increased as a result of increased sales and administrative functions in our cathodic protection operation and increased information technology investments and other costs allocated from our corporate administrative function. Partially offsetting the increase in operating expenses was a decrease resulting from controlled spending efforts in response to market challenges in our coating services operation, our industrial linings operation and our pipe coating and insulation operation.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted operating expenses for the segment by $2.1 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 19.3% and 18.2% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Income (Loss) and Operating Margin\nCorrosion Protection recognized a operating loss of $1.8 million in 2015 compared to a operating loss of $31.0 million in 2014. Operating margin increased 640 basis points to (0.4)% in 2015 compared to (6.8)% in 2014.\nIncluded in operating income (loss) were the following pre-tax items: (i) loss reserve of $2.9 million related to a long-dated accounts receivable in 2015, (ii) long-lived asset impairment charges of $11.3 million in 2014, (iii) goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 million and $35.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (iv) definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $10.9 million in 2014, and (v) acquisition-related expenses of $0.5 million and $0.7 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nExcluding the above items, operating income decreased $15.9 million, or 58.0%, to $11.5 million in 2015 from $27.4 million in 2014 and operating margin declined 340 basis points to 2.6% in 2015 from 6.0% in 2014. These decreases were primarily due to a decline in revenues and related gross profit as a result of challenging market conditions. As noted above, these declines were mainly the result of decreased customer spending and customer driven delays in project start dates, particularly as it relates to our businesses tied to the upstream, and to a lesser extent midstream, energy markets which were negatively impacted by low oil prices.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted operating income for the segment by $3.9 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nEnergy Services Segment\nEnergy Services operates solely in the United States and generates all revenues and incurs all expenses in U.S. dollars. There were no impacts from foreign currencies in relation to the U.S dollar for the segment for the reported periods.\nKey financial data for Energy Services was as follows:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90,515\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>28,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,458\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,124\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130\n</td> <td>)bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>29,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,527\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expenses\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(323\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(333\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>2,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>(4,486\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,542\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(244.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>560\n</td> <td>bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,310\n</td> <td>)bp\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________\nN/A\u201d represents not applicable.\nN/M\u201d represents not meaningful.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenues\nRevenues in Energy Services decreased $90.5 million, or 26.7%, to $248.9 million in 2016 compared to $339.4 million in 2015. The decrease was due to a revenue decline of $68.3 million in our upstream operation, located primarily in Central California and the Permian Basin. As part of the 2016 Restructuring, we significantly reduced our exposure to the upstream energy market in response to challenging upstream energy market conditions. Also contributing to the decrease in revenues was a decline of $22.2 million in our downstream operation primarily due to reduced refinery clean-up, construction and turnaround activities.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit in Energy Services decreased $14.5 million, or 33.9%, to $28.2 million in 2016 compared to $42.7 million in 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to declining revenues, as noted above, and cost overruns mainly on certain isolated lump sum construction projects in the first half of 2016 associated with the downsizing of our upstream operation.\nGross profit margin declined 130 basis points to 11.3% in 2016 compared to 12.6% in 2015 primarily due to the cost overruns mentioned above and a decline in higher margin clean-up, construction and turnaround activities in our downstream operation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in Energy Services decreased $4.0 million, or 11.8%, to $30.0 million in 2016 compared to $34.0 million in 2015. As part of the 2016 Restructuring, we recognized charges of $5.4 million in 2016 primarily related to the downsizing our upstream operation. Excluding restructuring charges, operating expenses decreased $9.4 million, or 27.8%,\nprimarily due to controlled spending efforts as well as reserve decreases totaling $4.1 million in 2016 for certain Brinderson pre-acquisition matters and a $0.7 million expense in 2015 for severance related costs due to organizational leadership changes.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 12.0% and 10.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.9% and 10.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Loss and Operating Margin\nOperating loss in Energy Services decreased $20.7 million, or 82.2%, to a loss of $4.5 million in 2016 compared to a loss of $25.2 million in 2015. Operating margin improved 560 basis points to (1.8)% in 2016 from (7.4)% in 2015.\nIncluded in operating income (loss) were the following pre-tax items: (i) 2016 Restructuring charges of $8.2 million primarily related to severance, retention, extension of benefits, employee assistance programs, wind-down, early lease termination and other restructuring costs related to the downsizing of our upstream operation in 2016, (ii) reserve decreases totaling $4.1 million in 2016 for certain Brinderson pre-acquisition matters, (iii) goodwill impairment charges of $33.5 million in 2015, and (iv) acquisition-related expenses of $0.3 million in 2015 related to the purchase of Schultz.\nExcluding the above items, operating income decreased $9.2 million, or 105.2%, to a loss of $0.5 million in 2016 compared to income of $8.7 million in 2015 and operating margin declined 280 basis points to (0.2)% in 2016 compared to 2.6% in 2015. These decreases were primarily due to decreases in revenues and related impacts to gross profit and gross profit margins as noted above, partially offset by reduced operating expenses resulting from restructuring and a reduction in reserves related to certain Brinderson pre-acquisition matters.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues in Energy Services increased $33.6 million, or 11.0%, to $339.4 million in 2015 compared to $305.8 million in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by a $55.8 million increase in refining maintenance and turnaround service activities in our downstream operation in the western United States. Robust demand for our downstream services resulted in record billable hours in 2015 as our customers operated refineries at high utilization. Partially offsetting the increase in revenues was a $21.9 million revenue decline in our upstream operation as customers curtailed project activities in response to lower crude oil prices. The steep and rapid decline in crude oil prices beginning in late 2014 caused customers to tighten their capital expenditures, delay project start dates or renegotiate contract terms, including reductions in the prices of our products and services, or in some instances, contract cancellations or revisions.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit in Energy Services decreased $2.1 million, or 4.7%, to $42.7 million in 2015 compared to $44.8 million in 2014. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower revenues and price pressures in our upstream operation, partially offset by higher revenues and related gross profit in our downstream operation.\nGross profit margin declined 200 basis points to 12.6% in 2015 compared to 14.6% in 2014 primarily due to price pressures and reductions in higher margin activities in our upstream operation. The reduction in higher margin activities made it more challenging to recover our labor and equipment costs.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in Energy Services increased $7.2 million, or 27.0%, to $34.0 million in 2015 compared to $26.7 million in 2014. As part of the Brinderson escrow settlement, we recorded an offset to operating expenses of $4.5 million in 2014. Excluding the Brinderson escrow settlement, operating expenses increased $2.7 million, or 8.7%, to $34.0 million in 2015 compared to $31.2 million in 2014. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of additional support costs including sales staff, human resources and finance personnel to support growth in the downstream refining market, as well as increased corporate allocation costs as described earlier. Included in operating expenses for 2015 were expenses totaling $1.8 million related to Schultz, which was acquired in March 2015. Additionally, we recognized $0.7 million for employee severance costs related to organizational leadership changes in early 2015.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.0% and 8.7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding the Brinderson escrow settlement, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.0% and 10.2% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Income (Loss) and Operating Margin\nOperating income in Energy Services decreased $42.5 million, or 244.6%, to a loss of $25.2 million in 2015 compared to $17.4 million of income in 2014. Operating margin declined 1,310 basis points to (7.4)% in 2015 from 5.7% in 2014.\nIncluded in operating income (loss) were goodwill impairment charges of $33.5 million in 2015 and the Brinderson escrow settlement of $4.5 million in 2014. Excluding these items, operating income decreased $4.5 million, or 35.0%, to $8.4 million in 2015 compared to $12.9 million in 2014 and operating margin declined 170 basis points to 2.5% in 2015 from 4.2% in 2014. These decreases were primarily due to price pressures and reductions in higher margin activities in our upstream operation, partially offset by robust downstream refining activities in 2015. Also contributing to the declines in operating income and operating margin was an increase in operating expenses as noted above.\nIncluded in operating income were charges for acquisition related expenses totaling $0.3 million and $0.7 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We incurred these charges mainly in connection with the Schultz acquisition in 2015 and trailing costs related to the Brinderson acquisition in 2013.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income and Expense\nInterest income decreased less than $0.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest expense decreased by $1.0 million to $15.0 million in 2016 compared to $16.0 million in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized charges of $3.4 million related to certain arrangement fees associated with securing our new $650.0 million senior secured credit facility as well as the write-off of previously unamortized deferred financing costs. Excluding these prior year charges, interest expense increased $2.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher borrowing costs under our new Credit Facility, higher debt balances resulting from the February 2016 acquisition of Underground Solutions and an increase in amortized loan fees.\nInterest income decreased $0.4 million to $0.2 million in 2015 compared to $0.6 million in 2014, primarily due to lower interest rates throughout the year. Interest expense increased by $3.1 million to $16.0 million in 2015 compared to $12.9 million in 2014 primarily due to the fourth quarter of 2015 charges mentioned above, offset by reduced outstanding loan principal balances during 2015 compared to 2014.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther expense was $0.7 million in 2016 and primarily related to foreign currency transaction losses, partially offset by the release of cumulative currency translation gains related to disposed entities.\nOther expense was $2.9 million in 2015 and primarily related to foreign currency transaction losses, the $2.9 million loss recognized on the sale of Video Injection - Insituform SAS and the $0.6 million loss recognized on the sale of BPPC (both of which are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report), partially offset by income of $0.8 million related to a settlement of escrow claims for the acquisition of CRTS, Inc. (as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report) and the recorded gains of approximately $0.7 million on the sale of certain assets related to our restructured entities.\nOther expense was $3.9 million in 2014 and primarily related to foreign currency transaction losses, the $0.5 million loss recognized on the sale of our 49% interest in Bayou Coating and the $0.5 million loss recognized on the sale of Ka-te Insituform AG (both of which are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\nTaxes on Income (Loss)\nTaxes on income decreased $3.1 million to $6.1 million in 2016 compared to $9.2 million in 2015. Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 17.3% and 757.6% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2016 was positively impacted by: (i) a $4.2 million net benefit, or 11.8% benefit to the effective tax rate, related to reductions of previously recorded valuation allowances in the U.S., due to changes in the realization of future tax benefits and deferred tax composition changes; and (ii) a $2.6 million net benefit from foreign tax rate differences primarily related to earnings from Europe. Partially offsetting these benefits was: (i) a $1.4 million increase in the valuation allowance on certain net operating losses and deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, primarily Europe; (ii) certain non-deductible tax items related to the 2016 Restructuring; and (iii) a higher mix of earnings toward U.S. jurisdictions, which generally have higher statutory tax rates.\nThe effective tax rate in 2015 was unfavorably impacted by: (i) significant pre-tax charges primarily related to goodwill impairments, certain of which are not deductible for tax purposes; (ii) U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings; and (iii) the impact of establishing valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we are unlikely to recognize these benefits. Partially offsetting these items was a $1.5 million net benefit from foreign tax rate differences primarily related to earnings from Europe and Canada.\nTaxes on income increased $13.0 million to $9.2 million in 2015 compared to a tax benefit of $3.8 million in 2014. Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 757.6% and 10.7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEquity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies\nEquity in earnings of affiliated companies was zero in 2016 and 2015 and $0.6 million in 2014. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies in 2014 includes three months of contributions from Bayou Coating, our former pipe coating joint venture in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which was sold on March 31, 2014 (as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\nNon-controlling Interests\nIncome and loss attributable to non-controlling interests was a loss of $0.3 million in 2016 and income of $0.1 million and $1.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, losses from our joint ventures in Mexico and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by profitability from our joint ventures in Oman and Louisiana. In 2015, profitability from our joint venture in Oman and our coating joint venture in Canada, was partially offset by losses from our joint venture in Mexico and our insulation coating joint venture in Louisiana, which experienced project inefficiencies and lower operational margins. In 2014, profitability from our joint ventures in Oman, Canada and Mexico was offset by lower income from our joint venture in Morocco and losses from the start-up of our Louisiana joint venture.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations was zero, zero and $3.8 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectfully. Our BWW business ceased bidding new work and substantially completed all ongoing projects during the second quarter of 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed final liquidation of BWW, which included the settlement of outstanding receivables with a single customer associated with a larger fabrication project. We also incurred cash charges of $1.4 million related to certain professional fees incurred during dissolution as well as in connection with the settlement discussed above. This resulted in a recorded pre-tax charge of $6.0 million within discontinued operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Equivalents\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash\n</td> <td>4,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestricted cash held in escrow primarily relates to funds reserved for legal requirements, deposits made in lieu of retention on specific projects performed for municipalities and state agencies, or advance customer payments and compensating balances for bank undertakings in Europe. Changes in restricted cash flows are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the restriction.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe expect the principal operational use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, working capital, debt service and share repurchases.\nDuring 2016, capital expenditures were primarily related to the construction of the new plant utilized for the large pipe coating and insulation project in our Corrosion Protection segment. Additionally, capital expenditures were also related to growth and maintenance capital in our Infrastructure Solutions operations. For 2017, we expect a similar overall level of capital expenditures from that in 2016, with slightly increased capital expenditures to support the growth of our Infrastructure Solutions business and to expand our domestic cathodic protection facilities, offset by the completion of the pipe coating and insulation plant.\nUnder the terms of our Credit Facility, we are authorized to annually purchase up to $40 million of our common stock in open market transactions, subject to Board of Director authorization. The shares are repurchased from time to time in the open market, subject to cash availability, market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and, subject to applicable regulatory requirements, may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases at any time without notice or authorization. During 2016, we acquired 2,226,875 shares of our common stock for $41.8 million ($18.76 average price per share) through the open market repurchase program discussed above. In October 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the open market repurchase of up to\n$40.0 million of our common stock to be made during 2017. Any shares repurchased during 2017 are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. Once repurchased, we promptly retire such shares.\nAs part of our 2016 Restructuring, we incurred $15.3 million in cash charges during 2016 related to employee severance, extension of benefits, employment assistance programs and early lease termination and other restructuring costs as we repositioned our Energy Services' upstream operations in California, right-sized Corrosion Protection to compete more effectively, and reduced corporate and other operating costs. We do not expect to incur any future cash costs related to the 2016 Restructuring. These actions reduced consolidated annual costs by approximately $17.4 million primarily through headcount reductions and office closures.\nAs part of our 2014 Restructuring, we incurred cash charges of $0.3 million in 2016 related to severance and benefits costs and other restructuring costs associated with exiting certain foreign locations. While estimated remaining cash costs to be incurred for the 2014 Restructuring are not expected to be material, we expect to incur additional non-cash charges in 2017, primarily related to the potential release of cumulative currency translation adjustments resulting from the disposal of certain entities as well as the foreign currency impact from settlement of inter-company loans.\nAt December 31, 2016, our cash balances were located worldwide for working capital and support needs. Given the breadth of our international operations, approximately $66.5 million, or 51.4%, of our cash was denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar as of December 31, 2016. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. As part of the February 2016 acquisition of Underground Solutions, we repatriated approximately $29.7 million from foreign subsidiaries to assist in funding the transaction, incurring approximately $3.2 million in additional taxes. This was viewed as a one-time, special-use transaction. With few exceptions, U.S. income taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, have not been provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. Our intention is to permanently reinvest these earnings.\nOur primary source of cash is operating activities. We occasionally borrow under our line of credit's available capacity to fund operating activities, including working capital investments. Our operating activities include the collection of accounts receivable as well as the ultimate billing and collection of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. At December 31, 2016, we believed our net accounts receivable and our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, as reported on our consolidated balance sheet, were fully collectible and a significant portion of the receivables will be collected within the next twelve months. From time to time, we have net receivables recorded that we believe will be collected but are being disputed by the customer in some manner. Disputes of this nature could meaningfully impact the timing of receivable collection or require us to invoke our contractual or legal rights in a lawsuit or alternative dispute resolution proceeding. If in a future period we believe any of these receivables are no longer collectible, we would increase our allowance for bad debts through a charge to earnings.\nIn March 2016, we settled an outstanding project dispute with a client in Infrastructure Solutions. In connection with the settlement, we agreed to forgo approximately $7.5 million in receivables owed by our client and we agreed to pay an additional $2.4 million. During April 2016, we paid the settlement amount. The customer receivable, along with the related allowance for doubtful account, was written off as of March 31, 2016.\nCash Flows from Operations\nCash flows from operating activities of continuing operations provided $73.2 million in 2016 compared to $132.0 million provided in 2015. The decrease in operating cash flow from 2016 to 2015 was primarily due to lower cash-related earnings in 2016 and lower cash flows related to working capital primarily as a result of the timing of vendor payments. Net income during 2016 was negatively impacted by $15.3 million in cash charges related to our 2016 Restructuring.\nWorking capital used $10.1 million of cash during 2016 compared to $35.5 million provided in 2015. This decrease in cash flow was primarily due to significant movements in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and prepaid expenses and other current assets. Our billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings was $62.7 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $24.8 million from December 31, 2015, due primarily to the timing of billing and advance deposits received on certain coating and insulation projects at our Bayou Louisiana facility. Our prepaid expenses and other current assets was $51.8 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $15.2 million from December 31, 2015, due primarily to the timing of advance deposits paid to suppliers on the same projects described above. Excluding the changes in the line items described above, the other elements of working capital provided $0.9 million in cash in 2016 primarily due to a focused effort on accounts receivable management, partially offset by the timing of vendor payments. Days sales outstanding decreased by approximately five days as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 partially due to the coating and insulation project activity stated above and the impact of stronger collections in nearly all operations globally, with particular\nimprovement in the North American CIPP operation. During 2015 and 2014, we improved our DSO by fifteen and eight days, respectively.\nCash flows from operating activities of continuing operations provided $81.9 million in 2014. The increase in operating cash flow from 2015 to 2014 was primarily related to increased contributions provided by working capital, partially offset by lower cash-related earnings in 2015. The net losses recorded in 2015 and 2014 primarily relate to non-cash charges of approximately $48.7 million and $97.1 million, respectively. Working capital provided $35.5 million of cash during 2015 compared to $17.9 million used in 2014. This increase in cash flow was primary due to significant movements in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and prepaid expenses and other current assets due primarily to the timing of billing and advance deposits received on the coating and insulation projects noted above. Also contributing to the increased cash flow was the focused effort on accounts receivable management, as described above.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nInvesting activities from continuing operations used $127.3 million and $39.1 million of cash in 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016, we used $96.3 million to acquire Underground Solutions, selected assets of Fyfe Europe, the CIPP business of LMJ and Concrete Solutions. During 2015, we used $6.7 million to acquire Schultz Mechanical Contractors. During 2016, we received proceeds of $6.6 million, net of cash disposed, from the sale of our interest in our Canadian pipe coating operation. We used $38.8 million in cash for capital expenditures in 2016 compared to $29.5 million used in 2015. The increase during 2016 was primarily due to investments in growth capital related to our global Infrastructure Solutions operations and $13.5 million in capital expenditures related to constructing the new pipe coating and insulation plant in our Corrosion Protection segment. In 2016 and 2015, $1.2 million and $0.9 million of non-cash capital expenditures were included in accounts payable and accrued expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2016 and 2015 were partially offset by $3.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in proceeds received from fixed asset disposals.\nIn 2014, investing activities from continuing operations used $23.2 million of cash. We used $32.9 million in cash for capital expenditures and sold our interests in Bayou Coating for a total sale price of $9.1 million.\nDuring 2017, we anticipate that we will spend approximately $40.0 million to $45.0 million for capital expenditures.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities used $25.9 million during 2016 compared to $50.2 million used in 2015. In 2016 and 2015, we used cash of $44.5 million and $27.8 million, respectively, to repurchase 2.3 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively, of our common stock through open market purchases and in connection with our equity compensation programs. We had net borrowings of $36.0 million from our line of credit during 2016, primarily to fund our acquisition activity, and we used cash of $17.5 million to pay down the principal balance of our term loan. During 2015, we amended and restated our $650.0 million credit facility and (i) borrowed $350.0 million on the term loan; (ii) used cash of $368.8 million to retire the previous credit facility; (iii) used cash of $4.4 million for facility financing fees; and (iv) made a $26.5 million mandatory prepayment on the balance of our term loan, utilizing $26.0 million from our line of credit to fund the term loan prepayment.\nIn 2014, cash flows from financing activities used $34.6 million of cash. During the year, we used cash of $31.1 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of our common stock. Additionally, we used cash of $22.0 million to pay down the principal balance of our term loans and borrowed $10.0 million on the line of credit under our credit facility for working capital needs.\nLong-Term Debt\nIn October 2015, we entered into an amended and restated $650.0 million senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The credit facility consists of a $300.0 million five-year revolving line of credit and a $350.0 million five-year term loan facility.\nOur indebtedness at December 31, 2016 consisted of $328.1 million outstanding from the $350.0 million term loan under the credit facility and $36.0 million on the line of credit under the credit facility. During 2016, we (i) borrowed $30.0 million on the line of credit to help fund the acquisition of Underground Solutions; (ii) borrowed $3.0 million on the line of credit to help fund a small acquisition; and (iii) had net borrowings of $3.0 million on the line of credit for both domestic and international working capital needs. Additionally, we designated $9.6 million of debt held by our joint venture partners (representing funds loaned by our joint venture partners) as third-party debt in the consolidated financial statements and held $0.3 million of third-party notes and bank debt at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $28.2 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under the credit facility. Of such amount, $15.4 million was collateral for the benefit of certain of our insurance carriers and $12.8 million was for letters of credit or bank guarantees of performance or payment obligations of foreign subsidiaries.\nAlso in October 2015, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of $262.5 million, which is set to expire in October 2020. The notional amount of this swap mirrored the amortization of a $262.5 million portion of our $350.0 million term loan drawn from our credit facility. The swap requires us to make a monthly fixed rate payment of 1.46% calculated on the amortizing $262.5 million notional amount, and provides for us to receive a payment based upon a variable monthly LIBOR interest rate calculated on the same amortizing $262.5 million notional amount. The receipt of the monthly LIBOR-based payment offsets the variable monthly LIBOR-based interest cost on a corresponding $262.5 million portion of our term loan from the credit facility. This interest rate swap is used to partially hedge the interest rate risk associated with the volatility of monthly LIBOR rate movement and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge.\nThe credit facility is subject to certain financial covenants, including a consolidated financial leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2016, based upon the financial covenants, we had the capacity to borrow up to $53.5 million of additional debt under our credit facility. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2016 and expect continued compliance for the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that we have adequate resources and liquidity to fund future cash requirements and debt repayments with cash generated from operations, existing cash balances and additional short- and long-term borrowing capacity for the next 12 months. We expect cash generated from operations to increase in 2017 due to improved operating income, improved working capital management initiatives and the cost savings generated through our restructuring efforts.\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for additional information and disclosures regarding our long-term debt.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe have entered into various contractual obligations and commitments in the course of our ongoing operations and financing strategies. Contractual obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that we are required to make under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities or from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue-producing activities. Commercial commitments represent contingent obligations, which become payable only if certain pre-defined events were to occur, such as funding financial guarantees. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for further discussion regarding our commitments and contingencies.\nThe following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016. This table includes cash obligations related to principal outstanding under existing debt agreements and operating leases (in thousands):\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Obligations (1) (2) (3) (4)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt and notes payable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>374,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>38,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>61,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Cash obligations are not discounted.

All debt is presented in the balance sheet. Our future commitments were $473.4 million at December 31, 2016. We have no other off-balance sheet financing arrangements or commitments. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report regarding commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement dates. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nSome accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues and costs as construction, engineering and installation contracts progress using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which relies on total expected contract revenues and estimated total costs. Under this method, estimated contract revenues and resulting gross profit margin are recognized based on actual costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs. We follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made. Since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates, which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts, recognized revenues and gross profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Total estimated costs, and thus contract gross profit, are impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling and the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, customer needs, customer delays in providing approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation and politics also may affect the progress and estimated cost of a project's completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition and gross profit. Revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. The effects of any changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of this Report, if material. When current estimates of total contract costs indicate that the contract will result in a loss, the projected loss is recognized in full in the period in which the loss becomes evident. Revenues from change orders, extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when it is probable that they will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount can be reliably estimated. Given the uncertainties associated with some of our contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made. Revisions to estimates could result in the reversal of revenues and gross profit previously recognized. Approximately 69% of our revenues were derived from percentage-of-completion accounting in each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nRevenues from Brinderson are derived mainly from multiple maintenance contracts under multi-year, long-term Master Service Agreements and alliance contracts, as well as, engineering and construction-type contracts. Brinderson enters into contracts with its customers that contain three principal types of pricing provisions: time and materials, cost plus fixed fee and fixed price. Although the terms of these contracts vary, most are made pursuant to cost reimbursable contracts on a time and materials basis under which revenues are recorded based on costs incurred at agreed upon contractual rates. Brinderson also performs services on a cost plus fixed fee basis under which revenues are recorded based upon costs incurred at agreed upon rates and a proportionate amount of the fixed fee or percentage stipulated in the contract.\nMany of our contracts provide for termination of the contract at the convenience of the customer. If a contract is terminated prior to completion, we would typically be compensated for progress up to the time of termination and any termination costs. In addition, many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements with liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances that are within our control. Losses on terminated contracts and liquidated damages have historically not been significant.\nTaxation\nWe provide for estimated income taxes payable or refundable on current year income tax returns, as well as the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards, in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes ( FASB ASC 740\u201d). FASB ASC 740 also requires that a valuation allowance be recorded against any deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized in the future. The determination is based on our ability to generate future taxable income and, at times, is dependent on our ability to implement strategic tax initiatives to ensure full utilization of recorded deferred tax assets. Should we not be able to implement the necessary tax strategies, we may need to record valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets, including those related to foreign income tax benefits. Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 740, tax benefits from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. In addition, this recognition model includes a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in accordance with FASB ASC 740. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nWe recognize tax liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC 740 and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were appropriately accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 740, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.\nWe have recorded income tax expense at U.S. tax rates on all profits, except for undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $208.4 million, which are considered indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the indefinitely reinvested profits is not feasible. A deferred tax asset is recognized only if we have definite plans to generate a U.S. tax benefit by repatriating earnings in the foreseeable future.\nPurchase Price Accounting\nWe account for our acquisitions in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations. The base cash purchase price plus the estimated fair value of any non-cash or contingent consideration given for an acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values of such assets and liabilities. The excess of the total consideration over the aggregate net fair values assigned is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration, if any, is recognized as a liability as of the acquisition date with subsequent adjustments recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Indirect and general expenses related to business combinations are expensed as incurred.\nWe typically determine the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination using independent valuations that rely on management's estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Key assumptions include cash flow projections, growth rates, asset lives, and discount rates based on an analysis of weighted average cost of capital.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment and other identified intangibles (primarily customer relationships, patents and acquired technologies, trademarks, licenses and non-compete agreements) are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment, and, except for goodwill and certain trademarks, are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates. During 2016, no such changes were noted. If we determine that the useful life of our property, plant and equipment or our identified intangible assets should be changed, we would depreciate or amortize the net book value in excess of the salvage value over its revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing or decreasing depreciation or amortization expense.\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such impairment tests are based on a comparison of undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nImpairment Reviews - 2015\nAs a result of the annual impairment assessment in accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( FASB ASC 350\u201d) as of October 1, 2015, the CRTS reporting unit had a fair value below its carrying value, which caused us to review the financial performance of at risk asset groups within that reporting unit in accordance with FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ( FASB ASC 360\u201d). The results of CRTS are reported within the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.\nIn response to contract losses in the Central California upstream energy market during the fourth quarter of 2015 and our subsequent decision to reduce exposure to the upstream market, we performed a market assessment of our energy-related businesses and concluded that sustained low oil prices would continue to create market challenges for the foreseeable future, including a continued reduction in spending by certain of our customers in 2016. The loss of the contracts, coupled with the decision to downsize, caused us to review the financial performance of at risk asset groups within the reporting unit. The results of Energy Services are reported within the Energy Services reportable segment.\nThe assets of each asset group represent the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be determined independent of other groups of assets and liabilities. We developed internal forward business plans under the guidance of local and regional leadership to determine the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from each of the at risk asset groups' long-lived assets. Such were based on our best estimates considering the likelihood of various outcomes. Based on the internal projections, we determined that the undiscounted expected future cash flows for all of the identified at risk asset groups exceeded the carrying value of the assets, and as such, no impairment to recorded long-lived assets was required.\nImpairment Review - September 30, 2014\nAs part of the 2014 Restructuring, we evaluated the long-lived assets of our global operations affected by the restructuring initiative. The affected reporting units were (i) the Bayou reporting unit ( Bayou Reporting Unit\u201d); (ii) the European Sewer and Water Rehabilitation ( Europe\u201d) reporting unit; and (iii) the Asia-Pacific Sewer and Water Rehabilitation ( Asia-Pacific\u201d) reporting unit. The results of the Bayou Reporting Unit and its related asset groups are reported within the Corrosion Protection reportable segment. The results of Europe and Asia-Pacific and their related asset groups are reported within the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment.\nWe performed an asset impairment review as of September 30, 2014 for all of our at risk asset groups within each of the affected reporting units in accordance with FASB ASC 360. We also engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of long-lived assets at these at risk asset groups. Based upon the results of the analysis, the at risk asset groups with a fair value less than the carrying value of their respective assets included Bayou and Bayou Delta of the Bayou Reporting Unit; France of the Europe reporting unit; and Malaysia and India of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit. Accordingly, we recorded a total impairment charge of $11.9 million in the third quarter of 2014, which consisted of $10.9 million related to Bayou, $0.4 million related to Bayou Delta, $0.2 million related to France, $0.3 million related to Malaysia and $0.1 million related to India. The impairment charge was primarily recorded to cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIncluded within the impairment assessment were Bayou-related intangible assets such as tradenames and customer relationships that were also tested on an undiscounted cash flow basis. For customer relationships, the undiscounted expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value; thus, we engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of customer relationships recorded at Bayou. Based on the results of the valuation, the carrying amount of the customer relationship intangible asset at Bayou exceeded the fair value and resulted in a full impairment as of September 30, 2014. Accordingly, we recorded a $10.9 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2014. The impairment charge was recorded to definite-lived intangible asset impairment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAnnual Impairment Assessment - October 1, 2014\nAs a result of the annual impairment assessment in accordance with FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ( FASB ASC 350\u201d), the Fyfe Rehabilitation ( Fyfe\u201d) reporting unit had a fair value below its carrying value, which caused us to review the financial performance of all at risk asset groups within that reporting unit in accordance with FASB ASC 360. The results of Fyfe and its related asset groups are reported within the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment. Based on the results of the valuation, the carrying amount of the customer relationship intangible asset at Fyfe Latin America exceeded the fair value and resulted in a $1.2 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2014. The impairment charge was recorded to definite-lived intangible asset impairment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment Review - December 31, 2014\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, certain reporting units operating in the energy sector experienced customer-driven delays, work order cancellations, and canceled sales opportunities as a result of declining crude oil prices since October 2014. As a result, we evaluated the long-lived assets of our operations affected by these circumstances and performed an asset impairment review as of December 31, 2014 for all of our at risk asset groups within the CRTS and Bayou reporting units. The results of these reporting units and their related asset groups are reported within the Corrosion Protection reportable segment. Based on the internal projections, we determined that the undiscounted expected future cash flows for all of the identified at risk asset groups exceeded the carrying value of the assets, and as such, no impairment to recorded long-lived assets was required.\nThe fair value estimates described above were determined using observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs, which are based on level 3 inputs as defined in Note 12.\nGoodwill\nUnder FASB ASC 350, we assess recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. An impairment charge will be recognized to the extent that the implied fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Factors that could potentially trigger an impairment review include (but are not limited to):\n\u2022significant underperformance of a segment relative to expected, historical or forecasted operating results;\n\u2022significant negative industry or economic trends;\n\u2022significant changes in the strategy for a segment including extended slowdowns in the segment's market;\n\u2022a decrease in market capitalization below our book value; and\n\u2022a significant change in regulations.\nWhether during the annual impairment assessment or during a trigger-based impairment review, we determine the fair value of our reporting units and compare such fair value to the carrying value of those reporting units to determine if there are any indications of goodwill impairment.\nFair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit's fair value. Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic outlooks, which are used to forecast future revenues, earnings and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit. These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.\nThe market approach estimates fair value by first determining earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) multiples for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit. The EBITDA multiples for comparable companies are based upon current enterprise value. The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a control premium. We believe this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to its reporting units.\nThe income approach is based on forecasted future (debt-free) cash flows that are discounted to present value using factors that consider timing and risk of future cash flows. We believe this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit's expected long-term operating cash flow performance. Discounted cash flow projections are based on financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic outlooks, growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements. Estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes to business models, changes in our weighted average cost of capital, or changes in operating performance.\nThe discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows is one of the most significant assumptions utilized under the income approach. We determine the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the pre-tax cost of debt and cost of equity (including the risk-free rate on twenty year U.S. Treasury bonds), and certain other company-specific and market-based factors. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, the WACC for each reporting unit is adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company-specific risks. Accordingly, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ.\nAnnual Impairment Assessment - October 1, 2016\nWe had nine reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill at October 1, 2016 as follows: North America Pipe Rehabilitation, Europe Pipe Rehabilitation, Asia-Pacific Pipe Rehabilitation, Fyfe, Corrpro, United Pipeline Systems, Bayou, Coating Services and Energy Services. During 2016, we acquired four businesses (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report). Underground Solutions was integrated into the North America Pipe Rehabilitation reporting unit; LMJ was integrated into the Europe Pipe Rehabilitation reporting unit; and Fyfe Europe and Concrete Solutions were integrated into the Fyfe reporting unit.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, certain leadership changes and recent acquisitions within Infrastructure Solutions caused us to assess potential reporting unit composition changes, including consideration of aggregation criteria in accordance with FASB ASC 280-10-50-11 and FASB ASC 350-20-55, for certain of our reporting units. In particular, we considered the new management structure in addition to economic similarities and related performance measurement metrics in aggregating our North America Pipe Rehabilitation, Europe Pipe Rehabilitation and Asia-Pacific Pipe Rehabilitation reporting units into a single reporting unit. As noted above, all three reporting units were tested individually during the Company's 2016 annual impairment testing. There were no indications of impairment noted during this testing, nor were there any indications of\nimpairment during the fourth quarter of 2016 leading up to the reassessment. After assessing the above criteria , we aggregated the three reporting units into a single reporting unit, Municipal Pipe Rehabilitation, as of December 31, 2016. Going forward in 2017, our annual impairment test will be performed at the Municipal Pipe Rehabilitation reporting unit level.\nSignificant assumptions used in our October 2016 goodwill review included: (i) discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 16.0%; (ii) compound annual growth rates for revenues generally ranging from 2.2% to 7.2% for a majority of the reporting units, with one reporting unit utilizing a 10.8% annual growth rate due to a lower baseline and higher growth trajectory based on recent acquisitions and market potential; (iii) gross margin stability or slight improvement in the short term related to certain reporting units in the energy sector, but sustained or slightly increased gross margins long term; (iv) peer group EBITDA multiples; and (v) terminal values for each reporting unit using a long-term growth rate of 1.0% to 3.5%. If actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.\nDuring the assessment of our reporting units' fair values in relation to their respective carrying values, three reporting units had a fair value in excess of 30% of their carrying value, five reporting units had a fair value in excess of 10%, but below 30% of their carrying value, and one reporting unit had a fair value within 10% percent of its carrying value. The reporting unit with a fair value within 10% of its carrying value was the Energy Services reporting unit. The total value of goodwill recorded at the impairment testing date for the Energy Services reporting unit was $46.7 million.\nFor the Energy Services reporting unit, excess fair value in relation to its carrying value was 9.9%. The values derived from both the income approach and the market approach increased from the December 31, 2015 goodwill impairment review, and the fair value in relation to its carrying value improved from the prior year due to the successful restructuring efforts in 2016 to reposition our upstream energy business in Central California. The fair value for Energy Services increased $11.8 million, or 8.8%, from the prior year analysis. The 2016 analysis assumed a weighted average cost of capital of 13.0% and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%, which are both consistent with the December 31, 2015 review. The income approach analysis also included an annual revenue growth rate of approximately 5.4%, which is higher than the 2.6% growth assumed in the prior year analysis; while gross margins and EBITDA margins were decreased slightly in the short term due to the continued softness in the upstream energy markets. Projected cash flows were based, in part, on favorable refinery maintenance, construction and turnaround activity in 2017 and 2018. Prolonged periods of reduced customer spending could have a material negative affect on Energy Services' projected long-term cash flows, which could lead to future impairment charges.\nAnnual Impairment Assessment - October 1, 2015\nAs a result of the annual impairment assessment in accordance with FASB ASC 350, the CRTS reporting unit had a fair value less than its carrying value. Long-term expectations for the CRTS businesses remained low due to continued uncertainty in the upstream oil markets, which caused customer-driven delays in the more profitable international offshore pipeline market and delayed or canceled sales opportunities in certain North American markets. CRTS secured sizable project wins during 2014 and 2015; however, most were situated in international onshore and mining markets, which typically offer lower margin profiles. As a result of failing Step 1, we performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. Based on this analysis, we determined that recorded goodwill at CRTS was impaired by $10.0 million, which was recorded to Goodwill impairment\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining CRTS goodwill of $4.4 million. Projected cash flows were based, in part, on maintaining a presence in the higher-margin, international offshore pipeline market and our ability to expand its technology to other applications. If these assumptions do not materialize in a manner consistent with our expectations, there is risk of further impairment to recorded goodwill.\nImpairment Review - December 31, 2015\nIn response to contract losses in the Central California upstream energy market during the fourth quarter of 2015 and our subsequent decision to reduce exposure to the upstream market, we performed a market assessment of our energy-related businesses and concluded that sustained low oil prices would continue to create market challenges for the foreseeable future, including a continued reduction in spending by certain of our customers in 2016. The loss of the contracts, coupled with the decision to downsize, caused us to review the goodwill of our operations affected by these circumstances and determined that a triggering event had occurred. As such, we performed an interim goodwill impairment review for our Energy Services reporting unit as of December 31, 2015. In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 350, we determined the fair value of the affected reporting unit and it was found to be less than the carrying value.\nFor the Energy Services reporting unit, fair value in relation to its carrying value was negative 27.6%. The values derived from the income approach and the market approach decreased 29.0% and 27.6%, respectively, from the October 1, 2015 goodwill impairment analysis. Our expected future cash flows in 2016 and beyond were lowered primarily due to the loss of two key contracts in the Central California upstream energy market in the fourth quarter of 2015. The impairment analysis assumed a weighted average cost of capital of 13.0%, compared 13.5% in the October 1, 2015 review, and a long-term growth rate of 2.0%, which is consistent with the October 1, 2015 review. The income approach analysis included a year 1 decrease in revenue of approximately $90 million and an annual revenue growth rate thereafter of approximately 2.6%, which was slightly\nlower than the 3.3% annual growth in the previous analysis. Average gross margins were generally consistent between the two analyses; however, operating expenses declined in a manner consistent with revenues as a result of the benefits expected to be achieved from the 2016 Restructuring. As a result of failing Step 1, we performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. In estimating the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit, we assign the fair value (as determined in Step1) to the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit over its implied fair value is recorded as impairment. Based on this analysis, we determined that recorded goodwill at Energy Services was impaired by $33.5 million, which was recorded to Goodwill impairment\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining Energy Services goodwill of $46.7 million. Projected cash flows were based on maintaining a smaller but profitable presence in the upstream energy market and continued strength in the Central California downstream energy market. Also included in the projected cash flows were certain cost savings expected to be achieved through the 2016 Restructuring. If these assumptions do not materialize in a manner consistent with our expectations, there is risk of further impairment to recorded goodwill.\nImpairment Review - September 30, 2014\nAs a result of the 2014 Restructuring, we evaluated the goodwill of our global operations affected by the restructuring initiative and determined that a triggering event had occurred. As such, we performed a goodwill impairment review for each affected reporting unit as of September 30, 2014. Our reporting units adversely affected by the 2014 Restructuring were Bayou, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 350, we determined the fair value of our reporting units and compared such fair value to the carrying value of those reporting units. For all three reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value, and as such, no impairment to recorded goodwill was required.\nAnnual Impairment Assessment - October 1, 2014\nAs a result of the annual impairment assessment in accordance with FASB ASC 350, the Fyfe reporting unit had a fair value less than its carrying value. Longer-term expectations for the Fyfe businesses, primarily in North America, were lowered in 2014 because investments in operational leadership and business development yielded slower than expected growth. In previous years, we expected bidding activity would increase in 2014 and result in new contract wins that would commence in 2014 and 2015. While stability was restored and improvements were made in 2014, the ability to sustain new order intake and improve gross profits did not materialize as rapidly as expected. As a result of failing Step 1, we performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. Based on this analysis, we determined that recorded goodwill at Fyfe was impaired by $16.1 million, which was recorded to Goodwill impairment\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had remaining Fyfe goodwill of $50.2 million. Future cash flows included increased revenue projections related to growth in the pipeline market, specifically industrial and municipal pipelines. Delays in those growth projections could have a material negative affect on Fyfe's projected long-term cash flows. Also included in the projected cash flows were certain cost savings expected to be achieved through the 2014 Restructuring. If any of these assumptions do not materialize in a manner consistent with our expectations, there is risk of further impairment to recorded goodwill.\nImpairment Review - December 31, 2014\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, certain reporting units operating in the energy sector experienced customer-driven delays, work order cancellations, and canceled sales opportunities as a result of declining crude oil prices since October 2014. We evaluated the goodwill of our operations affected by these circumstances and determined that a triggering event had occurred. As such, we performed a goodwill impairment review for our Bayou and CRTS reporting units as of December 31, 2014. In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 350, we determined the fair value of our affected reporting units and compared such fair value to the carrying value of those reporting units. For both reporting units, carrying value exceeded fair value.\nFor the Bayou reporting unit, uncertainty in the upstream oil markets, which caused work order cancellations and canceled sales opportunities in North America for the Bayou Canada and CCSI asset groups, affected our expected future cash flows in 2015 and 2016. As a result of failing Step 1, we performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. Based on this analysis, we determined that Bayou's goodwill was fully impaired, and as such, recorded a $29.7 million charge to Goodwill impairment\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2014. As of December 31, 2014, there was no recorded goodwill at Bayou.\nFor the CRTS reporting unit, expected future cash flows were impacted by the uncertainty in the upstream oil markets, which caused customer-driven delays in the more profitable international offshore pipeline market and delayed or canceled sales opportunities in certain North American markets. As a result of failing Step 1, we performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value. Based on this analysis, we determined that recorded goodwill at CRTS was impaired by $5.7 million, which was recorded to Goodwill impairment\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of\nOperations in 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had remaining CRTS goodwill of $14.4 million. See subsequent impairment review performed as of October 1, 2015 above.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of goodwill at January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 (in millions):\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Infrastructure\nSolutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corrosion\nProtection\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Energy\nServices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, January 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill, gross\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated impairment losses\n</td> <td>(16,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,527\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94,996\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill, net\n</td> <td>174,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions (1)\n</td> <td>50,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation\n</td> <td>(1,616\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill, gross\n</td> <td>239,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>393,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated impairment losses\n</td> <td>(16,069\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,527\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94,996\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>During 2016 , we recorded goodwill of $44.0 million, $2.4 million, $0.8 million and $3.4 million related to the acquisitions of Underground Solutions, Fyfe Europe, LMJ and Concrete Solutions, respectively (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting Standards Updates\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of Aegion's operations and strategies, outlining its focus on maintaining, rehabilitating, and strengthening infrastructure worldwide.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nExecutive Summary\nAegion combines innovative technologies with market leading expertise to maintain, rehabilitate and strengthen infrastructure around the world. Since 1971, we have played a pioneering role in finding innovative solutions to rehabilitate aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in the wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries. We also maintain the efficient operation of refineries and other industrial facilities and provide innovative solutions for the strengthening of buildings, bridges and other structures. We are committed to Stronger. Safer. Infrastructure\u00ae. Our products and services are currently utilized in approximately 80 countries across six continents. We believe the depth and breadth of our products and services make us a leading provider for the world's infrastructure rehabilitation and protection needs.\nBusiness Outlook\nWe believe favorable end markets and the progress made over the last two years to advance our long-term strategy give us the opportunity to grow revenue and operating income across all three platforms in 2017, which is expected to result in strong earnings per share growth, greater cash generation and an increase in return on invested capital.\nInfrastructure Solutions\nWe will make investments in 2017 to expand the use of Insituform\u00ae CIPP in several regions currently underserved by Insituform in the North American wastewater pipeline market. Our objective is to maintain growth and our leading share in a large and mature market. Outside North America, we are selectively targeting markets in Europe for contract installation of Insituform\u00ae CIPP to compliment a strategy to grow third-party product sales across the continent. We are also pursuing additional contract installations opportunities in Australia and plan to grow third-party CIPP sales in several Asian countries.\nOne of the most attractive areas for growth is in the rehabilitation of municipal pressure pipelines, primarily in North America. We have a diverse portfolio of solutions in a highly fragmented and growing North American market. We also have an attractive market in Asia-Pacific for large-diameter pressure pipe strengthening. We completed a research and development effort in 2016 that is expected to significantly reduce material and installation costs for Tyfo\u00ae Fibrwrap\u00ae while maintaining the superior material properties and quality of the technology. We also improved our InsituMain\u00ae CIPP technology to give customers a more robust solution. These enhancements and favorable market conditions support our expectations for growth in 2017.\nWith favorable end markets, strategic investments and technology enhancements, we expect Infrastructure Solutions in 2017 to grow revenues faster than the low-to-mid-single digit three-year target. However, operating margins will likely be slightly lower than in 2016 due to potential increases in petroleum-based input and construction labor costs, especially in North America. We are employing continuous improvement processes in our CIPP manufacturing and operations to partially offset these expected cost headwinds.\nCorrosion Protection\nWe expect a modest recovery in 2017 from the impact caused by depressed oil prices over the last two years, which will be aided by the anticipated completion of a $130 million deepwater pipe coating and insulation project.\nOver 50 percent of Corrosion Protection's revenues come from cathodic protection services for midstream oil and gas pipelines in North America, an attractive and growing market that we believe justifies further investment to outpace market growth. To that end, we plan to roll out a new asset integrity management program in 2017 for pipeline corrosion inspections. The new service will improve data accuracy and processing efficiency, customize the data transfer format (including geospatial mapping) and provide faster access to the information by customers. Corrosion Protection's pipeline inspection services are expected to create a multiplier effect for our other capabilities in direct pipeline inspections, engineering, cathodic protection system installation and pipeline corrosion remediation. Our objective is to expand the relationships with our top customers, who are the leading pipeline owners in North America, to accelerate revenue growth. Asset integrity management is an important element of that strategy and we expect to transition a number of those customers to the new system in 2017.\nWith oil prices trading in a stable range since the fall of 2016, we have responded to more customer inquiries for our Tite Liner\u00ae lining pipeline protection system, pipe coatings and insulation for the United States Gulf Coast region and field pipe coatings domestically and overseas. We are encouraged by the growing customer interest and believe this can lead to a modestly improved energy market in 2017, especially in North America. The planned contribution from the deepwater project and anticipated modest recovery in the energy markets establishes our Corrosion Protection expectations for mid-teens revenue growth and mid-single digit operating margins in 2017. The outlook is in line with the three-year targets for revenue growth and operating margin expansion.\nEnergy Services\nWe expect Energy Services to build on the momentum achieved in the second half of 2016 after completing the downsizing of its upstream operations in Central California and the Permian Basin as part of the 2016 Restructuring. The outlook for day-to-day downstream refinery maintenance remains robust based on long-term contracts and our position as the lead maintenance provider in 13 out of the 17 refineries on the United States West Coast. We have an effort underway to expand our services to those customers in mechanical maintenance, turnaround support, electrical and instrumentation maintenance and small capital construction activities. We also expect growth in 2017 from a greater number of turnaround, or refinery shutdown, activities. We will continue to improve operating efficiencies to maximize margins and cash generation. The favorable outlook we expect in 2017 supports low to mid-single digit revenue growth and operating margins above the results achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAcquisitions/Strategic Initiatives/Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nOur recent acquisition strategy has focused on the world's aging infrastructure and the investment needed to maintain infrastructure in North America and overseas. During 2016, we targeted strategic acquisitions in the infrastructure sector by:\n i. adding patented Fusible PVC\u00ae pipe technology to our pressure pipe rehabilitation portfolio through the acquisition of Underground Solutions; \n ii. expanding our CIPP presence in Europe by acquiring the CIPP contracting operations of LMJ, a Danish company; \n iii. gaining worldwide rights to market, manufacture and install the patented Tyfo\u00ae Fibrwrap\u00ae FRP technology by acquiring Fyfe Europe; and \n iv. expanding our FRP presence in Asia through the acquisition of Concrete Solutions.  See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for additional information and disclosures regarding our acquisitions.\n2016 Restructuring\nDuring 2016, we completed our 2016 Restructuring, which (i) repositioned Energy Services' upstream operations in California, (ii) reduced Corrosion Protection's upstream exposure by divesting our interest in Bayou Perma-Pipe Canada, Ltd. ( BPPC\u201d), our Canadian pipe coating joint venture, (iii) right-sized Corrosion Protection to compete more effectively and (iv) reduced corporate and other operating costs. The 2016 Restructuring reduced consolidated annual costs by approximately $17.4 million, of which approximately $1.2 million, $6.6 million and $5.6 million related to recognized savings within Infrastructure Solutions, Corrosion Protection and Energy Services, respectively, and $4.0 million related to reduced corporate costs. Cost savings were achieved primarily through office closures and reducing headcount by approximately 964 employees, or 15.5% of our total workforce as of December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2016, we recorded pre-tax charges of $16.1 million ($10.3 million after tax), most of which were cash charges, consisting primarily of employee severance and benefits, early lease termination and other costs associated with the restructuring efforts as described above. We do not expect to incur any future charges related to the 2016 Restructuring.\n2014 Restructuring\nThe 2014 Restructuring generated annual operating cost savings of approximately $10.8 million and consisted of approximately $8.4 million and $2.4 million of recognized savings within Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection, respectively. We achieved these cost savings by (i) exiting certain unprofitable international locations for our CIPP business and consolidating our worldwide FRP business with the global CIPP business, all of which is in Infrastructure Solutions; and (ii) eliminating certain idle facilities in our pipe coating and insulation operation in Louisiana, which is in Corrosion Protection.\nWe have substantially completed all of the aforementioned objectives related to the 2014 Restructuring. Total headcount reductions were 86 as of December 31, 2016 and total pre-tax 2014 Restructuring charges since inception were $60.3 million ($44.8 million after tax) and consisted of non-cash charges totaling $48.3 million and cash charges totaling $12.0 million. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for additional information on the charges related to the 2014 Restructuring. Remaining headcount reductions and cash costs related to the 2014 Restructuring are not expected to be material. We expect to incur additional non-cash charges in 2017, primarily related to the potential release of cumulative currency translation adjustments resulting from the restructured locations as well as the foreign currency impact from settlement of inter-company loans. All such charges will be recognized in Infrastructure Solutions.\nSee Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions and strategic initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nIn 2016, Infrastructure Solutions experienced increased revenues and profitability due to favorable market conditions primarily in our CIPP business in North America. In February 2016, we added Fusible PVC\u00ae to our pressure pipe rehabilitation portfolio through the acquisition of Underground Solutions.\nEnergy Services and Corrosion Protection continued to experience upstream, and to a lesser extent midstream, market challenges as a result of low oil prices. In response to these market challenges, we successfully executed our 2016 Restructuring which included cost reductions, mainly from employee headcount reductions and office closures, and the divestiture of our Canadian joint venture interest in BPPC.\nSignificant Events\n2016 Restructuring - As part of the 2016 Restructuring, we recorded pre-tax charges of $16.1 million ($10.3 million post-tax) during 2016 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\n2014 Restructuring - As part of the 2014 Restructuring, we recorded pre-tax charges (credits) of $(0.2) million ($(0.1) million post-tax), $11.0 million ($8.7 million post-tax) and $26.7 million ($22.5 million post-tax) during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These charges exclude long-lived asset impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2014 for the Bayou, Europe and Asia-Pacific reporting units noted below. Including those charges, total 2014 Restructuring pre-tax charges were $49.5 million ($36.2 million post-tax) in 2014 (see Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\nImpairment of goodwill - We recorded pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $43.5 million ($35.7 million post-tax) and $51.5 million ($45.8 million post-tax) during 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report). These charges were recorded as follows:\nEnergy Services Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $33.5 million. In response to contract losses in the Central California upstream energy market during the fourth quarter of 2015 and our subsequent decision to reduce exposure to the upstream market, we performed a market assessment of our energy-related businesses and concluded that sustained low oil prices will continue to create market challenges for the foreseeable future, including a continued reduction in spending by certain of our customers in 2016. The loss of contracts, coupled with the decision to downsize, caused us to perform an interim impairment review of the goodwill and long-lived assets of our operations affected by these circumstances. As a result of the review, we determined that goodwill was impaired; however, there were no impairment charges related to long-lived assets. The Energy Services reporting unit is included in the Energy Services reportable segment.\nCRTS Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash charges of $10.0 million and $5.7 million, respectively. For both periods, we performed an impairment review for goodwill and long-lived assets as a result of customer-driven work delays, work order cancellations and canceled sales opportunities as a result of declining oil prices. In 2015, the impairment resulted from our annual assessment of goodwill. In 2014, the impairment resulted from an interim impairment review. For each period, we determined that goodwill was impaired; however, there were no impairment charges related to long-lived assets in either period. The CRTS reporting unit is included in the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.\nBayou Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $29.7 million. We performed an interim impairment review of Bayou's goodwill as a result of customer-driven work delays, work order cancellations and canceled sales opportunities stemming from declining oil prices. As a result of our review, we determined that goodwill was impaired. The Bayou reporting unit is included in the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.\nFyfe Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $16.1 million as part of our annual impairment assessment for goodwill. Fair value had fallen due to lower long-term expectations for the Fyfe businesses, primarily in North America. As a result of our assessment, we determined that goodwill was impaired. The Fyfe reporting unit is included in the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment.\nImpairment of long-lived assets - During 2014, we recorded pre-tax, non-cash long-lived asset impairment charges of $24.0 million ($14.5 million post-tax) (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report). These charges were recorded as follows:\nBayou, Europe and Asia-Pacific Reporting Units - In the third quarter of 2014, as part of our 2014 Restructuring, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment impairment charges of $11.9 million related to (i) our Bayou and Bayou Delta asset groups within our Bayou reporting unit, (ii) our France asset group within our Europe reporting unit, and (iii) our Malaysia and India asset groups within our Asia-Pacific reporting unit. We\nevaluated the property and equipment of our global operations affected by the 2014 Restructuring and determined that these asset groups were impaired. The Europe and Asia-Pacific reporting units and their related assets groups are included in the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment. Also included in the impairment assessment were Bayou-related intangible assets such as tradenames and customer relationships that were also tested on an undiscounted cash flow basis. Based on the results of the valuation, the carrying amount of the customer relationship intangible asset at Bayou exceeded the fair value and resulted in a full impairment as of September 30, 2014. Accordingly, we recorded a $10.9 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2014.\nFyfe Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $1.2 million as a result of our annual impairment assessment for goodwill. During the goodwill assessment, the Fyfe reporting unit had a fair value below its carrying value, which caused us to perform an impairment review of long-lived assets. As a result of our review, we determined that the customer relationship intangible asset related to our Fyfe Latin America asset group had been fully impaired.\nBrinderson escrow settlement - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we finalized the settlement ( Brinderson escrow settlement\u201d) of negotiated working capital for the Brinderson acquisition in 2013 as well as escrow claims made pursuant to the purchase agreement. As a result of the settlement, we received proceeds of approximately $5.5 million, $1.0 million of which was recorded as a purchase price adjustment related to working capital, and the remaining $4.5 million was recorded as an offset to operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Brinderson is reported in the Energy Services reportable segment.\nLegal settlement - In December 2016, we settled two lawsuits related to the December 2012 departure of several key leaders in sales and operations for the Tyfo\u00ae Fibrwrap\u00ae technology, which is part of the Infrastructure Solutions platform. Under the settlement, we will receive $6.6 million; and accordingly, recorded the gain to Gain on litigation settlement\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The initial $3.6 million cash payment was received in December 2016 and the remainder is to be paid in $750,000 installments over the next four years.\nDivestitures - In December 2015, we recognized a loss of $0.6 million related to the sale of our 51% joint venture interest in BPPC, which transaction closed in February 2016 (see Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\nIn March 2014, we recognized a loss of $0.5 million related to the sale of our 49% joint venture interest in Bayou Coating.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report.\nOperating Results\n\n______________________________\nN/A\u201d represents not applicable.\nN/M\u201d represents not meaningful.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenues\nRevenues decreased $111.7 million, or 8.4%, to $1,221.9 million in 2016 compared to $1,333.6 million in 2015. The decrease in revenues was due to a $90.5 million decline in Energy Services' revenues primarily resulting from our first quarter 2016 decision to downsize our exposure to the upstream energy market due to the effects of lower oil prices and a decrease in refinery clean-up, construction and turnaround activities. Revenues in Corrosion Protection decreased $36.4 million mainly due to (i) a decrease in Canadian upstream, and to a lesser extent midstream, project activity attributable to a decline in client spending on crude oil projects as well as a $25.3 million revenue decline associated with the sale of our Canadian pipe coating joint venture interest in February 2016, (ii) a decrease in domestic upstream project activity and (iii) the completion of certain large international projects performed primarily in 2015 and completed in early 2016. Revenues in Infrastructure Solutions increased $15.3 million primarily due to our acquisition of Underground Solutions in February 2016 and an increase in CIPP contracting installation services activity in North America, partially offset by decreases in FRP project activity in North America and international CIPP contracting installation services activity. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated revenues, as well as individual segment revenues, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit decreased $22.6 million, or 8.2%, to $253.2 million in 2016 compared to $275.8 million in 2015. As part of the 2016 Restructuring and 2014 Restructuring, we recognized charges totaling $0.3 million and $2.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges, gross profit decreased $25.0 million, or 9.0%, to $253.5 million in 2016 compared to $278.5 million in 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a $10.0 million decrease in Corrosion Protection and a $14.5 million decrease in Energy Services primarily due to declines in revenues, as noted above, and added costs associated with certain challenging international projects in Corrosion Protection. Gross profit in Infrastructure Solutions increased $1.8 million largely driven by an increase in CIPP contracting installation services activity in North America and the contribution from Underground Solutions, partially offset by a decline in emergency large diameter pressure pipe projects in our North American FRP business. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated gross profit, as well as individual segment gross profit, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nGross profit margin remained consistent at 20.7% in 2016 and 2015. Excluding restructuring charges, gross profit margin declined 20 basis points to 20.7% in 2016 from 20.9% in 2015. Gross profit margin declined primarily due to the negative impacts from challenging upstream energy market conditions in Corrosion Protection and decreased labor and equipment utilization in our international CIPP operations in Infrastructure Solutions, partially offset by the higher margin contribution from Infrastructure Solutions' Underground Solutions business and improved margins in Energy Services.\nSee Segment Results below for broader discussion regarding changes in gross profit and gross profit margin by segment.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $12.4 million, or 5.9%, to $197.1 million in 2016 compared to $209.5 million in 2015. As part of the 2016 Restructuring and 2014 Restructuring, we recognized charges of $6.2 million and $4.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2015, we recorded a loss reserve of $2.9 million related to a long-dated accounts receivable in Corrosion Protection and a loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in Infrastructure Solutions. Excluding restructuring charges and noted loss reserves, operating expenses decreased $8.5 million, or 4.3%, to $190.9 million in 2016 compared to $199.4 million in 2015.\nThe decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to our restructuring efforts, which generated cost savings mainly in Energy Services' upstream operation and Corrosion Protection's upstream and midstream operations. Included in the decrease in operating expenses was an offset to operating expenses related to favorable reductions in reserves for certain Brinderson pre-acquisition matters in Energy Services and a decrease related to the sale of our Canadian pipe coating operation in Corrosion Protection. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating expenses was an increase in Infrastructure Solutions primarily related to the acquisition of Underground Solutions. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated operating expenses, as well as individual segment operating expenses, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 16.1% and 15.7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges and loss reserves noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.6% and 15.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations\nConsolidated income from continuing operations increased $37.2 million, or 465.0%, to $29.2 million in 2016, from a consolidated loss of $8.0 million in 2015.\nIncluded in consolidated income from continuing operations were the following pre-tax items: (i) 2016 Restructuring and 2014 Restructuring charges of $15.9 million ($10.2 million post-tax) and $11.0 million ($8.7 million post-tax) in 2016 and 2015, respectively, (ii) goodwill impairment charges of $43.5 million ($35.7 million post-tax) in 2015, (iii) loss reserves of $2.9 million ($2.0 million post-tax) in 2015 related to long-dated accounts receivable, (iv) a loss reserve of $2.8 million ($1.7 million post-tax) related to a legal matter in 2015, (v) gain on a litigation settlement of $6.6 million ($4.0 million post-tax) in 2016, (vi) the loss on the sale of BPPC of $0.6 million ($0.4 million post-tax) in 2015 and (vii) acquisition-related expenses of $2.7 million ($2.2 million post-tax) and $1.9 million ($1.2 million post-tax) in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nExcluding the above items, consolidated income from continuing operations decreased $8.2 million, or 17.8%, to $37.9 million in 2016 from $46.1 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to declining revenues and gross profit related to the negative impacts from the low oil price environment in Energy Services and Corrosion Protection, partially offset by an increase in revenues and gross profit in Infrastructure Solutions. Operating expenses favorably impacted consolidated income as a result of operating expense savings associated with our restructuring efforts and decreases in reserves for certain Brinderson pre-acquisition matters noted above, partially offset by the operating expense contribution from Underground Solutions. Consolidated income from continuing operations in 2016, as compared to 2015, was negatively impacted by an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowing costs and higher debt balances, but positively benefited from the $4.2 million reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance due to changes in the realization of future tax benefits. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated income from continuing operations in 2016 compared to 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $2.1 million, or 0.2%, to $1,333.6 million in 2015 compared to $1,331.4 million in 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily due to increased maintenance and turnaround services activity in our downstream operation within Energy Services, increased North American CIPP contracting installation services activity within Infrastructure Solutions, and increased project activity in our pipe coating and insulation operation in Louisiana within Corrosion Protection. Partially offsetting the increase in revenues were negative impacts from foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar which equated to a $51.8 million decline in revenues in 2015 compared to 2014. Revenues also declined as a result of our 2014 Restructuring as we exited or were in the process of exiting, certain under-performing operations located in European and Asia-Pacific regions in 2015. Additionally, revenues declined in our upstream and midstream oil and gas operations within Energy Services and Corrosion Protection.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit decreased $4.2 million, or 1.5%, to $275.8 million in 2015 compared to $280.0 million in 2014. Excluding 2014 Restructuring charges of $2.7 million and $4.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, within Infrastructure Solutions and long-lived asset impairment charges of $11.3 million in 2014 within Corrosion Protection, gross profit decreased $17.2 million, or 5.8%, to $278.5 million in 2015 compared to $295.7 million in 2014.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross profit by $10.6 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nGross profit margin declined 30 basis points to 20.7% in 2015 from 21.0% in 2014. Excluding 2014 Restructuring charges and long-lived asset impairment charges noted above, gross profit margin declined 130 basis points to 20.9% in 2015 from 22.2% in 2014.\nSee Segment Results below for broader discussion regarding changes in gross profit and gross profit margin by segment.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $24.6 million, or 10.5%, to $209.5 million in 2015 compared to $234.1 million in 2014. In 2015, we recorded a loss reserve of $2.9 million related to a long-dated accounts receivable in Corrosion Protection and a loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in Infrastructure Solutions. In 2014, we recorded a loss reserve of $7.5 million related to a disputed and long-dated accounts receivable in Infrastructure Solutions and an offset to operating expenses of $4.5 million related to the Brinderson escrow settlement in Energy Services. Excluding (i) the loss reserves of $2.9 million and $7.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (ii) the loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in 2015, (iii) the Brinderson escrow settlement offset of $4.5 million in 2014, and (iv) 2014 Restructuring charges of $4.4 million and $20.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, within Infrastructure Solutions; operating expenses decreased $11.2 million, or 5.3%, to $199.4 million in 2015 compared to $210.6 million in 2014.\nThe decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of cost savings achieved in our European, Asia-Pacific and North American operations as part of the 2014 Restructuring, as well as favorable impacts from foreign currency rates in\nrelation to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, operating expenses in Corrosion Protection decreased as a result of controlled spending efforts in our operations servicing the upstream market given the challenging market conditions. Partially offsetting these decreasing factors was an increase in operating expenses related to additional staff to support growth in the downstream refining market serviced by Energy Services.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted operating expenses by $4.7 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.7% and 17.6% in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Excluding the loss reserve for long-dated accounts receivable, the Brinderson escrow settlement and the 2014 Restructuring charges as noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.0% and 15.8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations was $8.0 million in 2015, an improvement of $23.6 million, or 74.7%, from a consolidated loss of $31.6 million in 2014.\nIncluded in consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations were the following pre-tax items: (i) 2014 Restructuring charges of $11.0 million ($8.7 million post-tax) and $26.7 million ($22.5 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (ii) goodwill impairment charges of $43.5 million ($35.7 million post-tax) and $51.5 million ($45.8 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (iii) definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $24.0 million ($14.5 million post-tax) in 2014, (iv) loss reserves of $2.9 million ($2.0 million post-tax) and $7.5 million ($4.5 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to long-dated accounts receivable, (v) a loss reserve of $2.8 million ($1.7 million post-tax) related to a legal matter in 2015, (vi) Brinderson escrow settlement gain of $4.5 million ($2.8 million post-tax)", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\nExecutive Summary\nAegion combines innovative technologies with market leading expertise to maintain, rehabilitate and strengthen infrastructure around the world. Since 1971, we have played a pioneering role in finding innovative solutions to rehabilitate aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in the wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries. We also maintain the efficient operation of refineries and other industrial facilities and provide innovative solutions for the strengthening of buildings, bridges and other structures. We are committed to Stronger. Safer. Infrastructure\u00ae. Our products and services are currently utilized in approximately 80 countries across six continents. We believe the depth and breadth of our products and services make us a leading provider for the world's infrastructure rehabilitation and protection needs.\nBusiness Outlook\nWe believe favorable end markets and the progress made over the last two years to advance our long-term strategy give us the opportunity to grow revenue and operating income across all three platforms in 2017, which is expected to result in strong earnings per share growth, greater cash generation and an increase in return on invested capital.\nInfrastructure Solutions\nWe will make investments in 2017 to expand the use of Insituform\u00ae CIPP in several regions currently underserved by Insituform in the North American wastewater pipeline market. Our objective is to maintain growth and our leading share in a large and mature market. Outside North America, we are selectively targeting markets in Europe for contract installation of Insituform\u00ae CIPP to compliment a strategy to grow third-party product sales across the continent. We are also pursuing additional contract installations opportunities in Australia and plan to grow third-party CIPP sales in several Asian countries.\nOne of the most attractive areas for growth is in the rehabilitation of municipal pressure pipelines, primarily in North America. We have a diverse portfolio of solutions in a highly fragmented and growing North American market. We also have an attractive market in Asia-Pacific for large-diameter pressure pipe strengthening. We completed a research and development effort in 2016 that is expected to significantly reduce material and installation costs for Tyfo\u00ae Fibrwrap\u00ae while maintaining the superior material properties and quality of the technology. We also improved our InsituMain\u00ae CIPP technology to give customers a more robust solution. These enhancements and favorable market conditions support our expectations for growth in 2017.\nWith favorable end markets, strategic investments and technology enhancements, we expect Infrastructure Solutions in 2017 to grow revenues faster than the low-to-mid-single digit three-year target. However, operating margins will likely be slightly lower than in 2016 due to potential increases in petroleum-based input and construction labor costs, especially in North America. We are employing continuous improvement processes in our CIPP manufacturing and operations to partially offset these expected cost headwinds.\nCorrosion Protection\nWe expect a modest recovery in 2017 from the impact caused by depressed oil prices over the last two years, which will be aided by the anticipated completion of a $130 million deepwater pipe coating and insulation project.\nOver 50 percent of Corrosion Protection's revenues come from cathodic protection services for midstream oil and gas pipelines in North America, an attractive and growing market that we believe justifies further investment to outpace market growth. To that end, we plan to roll out a new asset integrity management program in 2017 for pipeline corrosion inspections. The new service will improve data accuracy and processing efficiency, customize the data transfer format (including geospatial mapping) and provide faster access to the information by customers. Corrosion Protection's pipeline inspection services are expected to create a multiplier effect for our other capabilities in direct pipeline inspections, engineering, cathodic protection system installation and pipeline corrosion remediation. Our objective is to expand the relationships with our top customers, who are the leading pipeline owners in North America, to accelerate revenue growth. Asset integrity management is an important element of that strategy and we expect to transition a number of those customers to the new system in 2017.\nWith oil prices trading in a stable range since the fall of 2016, we have responded to more customer inquiries for our Tite Liner\u00ae lining pipeline protection system, pipe coatings and insulation for the United States Gulf Coast region and field pipe coatings domestically and overseas. We are encouraged by the growing customer interest and believe this can lead to a modestly improved energy market in 2017, especially in North America. The planned contribution from the deepwater project and anticipated modest recovery in the energy markets establishes our Corrosion Protection expectations for mid-teens revenue growth and mid-single digit operating margins in 2017. The outlook is in line with the three-year targets for revenue growth and operating margin expansion.\nEnergy Services\nWe expect Energy Services to build on the momentum achieved in the second half of 2016 after completing the downsizing of its upstream operations in Central California and the Permian Basin as part of the 2016 Restructuring. The outlook for day-to-day downstream refinery maintenance remains robust based on long-term contracts and our position as the lead maintenance provider in 13 out of the 17 refineries on the United States West Coast. We have an effort underway to expand our services to those customers in mechanical maintenance, turnaround support, electrical and instrumentation maintenance and small capital construction activities. We also expect growth in 2017 from a greater number of turnaround, or refinery shutdown, activities. We will continue to improve operating efficiencies to maximize margins and cash generation. The favorable outlook we expect in 2017 supports low to mid-single digit revenue growth and operating margins above the results achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAcquisitions/Strategic Initiatives/Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nOur recent acquisition strategy has focused on the world's aging infrastructure and the investment needed to maintain infrastructure in North America and overseas. During 2016, we targeted strategic acquisitions in the infrastructure sector by:\n i. adding patented Fusible PVC\u00ae pipe technology to our pressure pipe rehabilitation portfolio through the acquisition of Underground Solutions; \n ii. expanding our CIPP presence in Europe by acquiring the CIPP contracting operations of LMJ, a Danish company; \n iii. gaining worldwide rights to market, manufacture and install the patented Tyfo\u00ae Fibrwrap\u00ae FRP technology by acquiring Fyfe Europe; and \n iv. expanding our FRP presence in Asia through the acquisition of Concrete Solutions.  See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for additional information and disclosures regarding our acquisitions.\n2016 Restructuring\nDuring 2016, we completed our 2016 Restructuring, which (i) repositioned Energy Services' upstream operations in California, (ii) reduced Corrosion Protection's upstream exposure by divesting our interest in Bayou Perma-Pipe Canada, Ltd. ( BPPC\u201d), our Canadian pipe coating joint venture, (iii) right-sized Corrosion Protection to compete more effectively and (iv) reduced corporate and other operating costs. The 2016 Restructuring reduced consolidated annual costs by approximately $17.4 million, of which approximately $1.2 million, $6.6 million and $5.6 million related to recognized savings within Infrastructure Solutions, Corrosion Protection and Energy Services, respectively, and $4.0 million related to reduced corporate costs. Cost savings were achieved primarily through office closures and reducing headcount by approximately 964 employees, or 15.5% of our total workforce as of December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2016, we recorded pre-tax charges of $16.1 million ($10.3 million after tax), most of which were cash charges, consisting primarily of employee severance and benefits, early lease termination and other costs associated with the restructuring efforts as described above. We do not expect to incur any future charges related to the 2016 Restructuring.\n2014 Restructuring\nThe 2014 Restructuring generated annual operating cost savings of approximately $10.8 million and consisted of approximately $8.4 million and $2.4 million of recognized savings within Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection, respectively. We achieved these cost savings by (i) exiting certain unprofitable international locations for our CIPP business and consolidating our worldwide FRP business with the global CIPP business, all of which is in Infrastructure Solutions; and (ii) eliminating certain idle facilities in our pipe coating and insulation operation in Louisiana, which is in Corrosion Protection.\nWe have substantially completed all of the aforementioned objectives related to the 2014 Restructuring. Total headcount reductions were 86 as of December 31, 2016 and total pre-tax 2014 Restructuring charges since inception were $60.3 million ($44.8 million after tax) and consisted of non-cash charges totaling $48.3 million and cash charges totaling $12.0 million. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report for additional information on the charges related to the 2014 Restructuring. Remaining headcount reductions and cash costs related to the 2014 Restructuring are not expected to be material. We expect to incur additional non-cash charges in 2017, primarily related to the potential release of cumulative currency translation adjustments resulting from the restructured locations as well as the foreign currency impact from settlement of inter-company loans. All such charges will be recognized in Infrastructure Solutions.\nSee Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions and strategic initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nIn 2016, Infrastructure Solutions experienced increased revenues and profitability due to favorable market conditions primarily in our CIPP business in North America. In February 2016, we added Fusible PVC\u00ae to our pressure pipe rehabilitation portfolio through the acquisition of Underground Solutions.\nEnergy Services and Corrosion Protection continued to experience upstream, and to a lesser extent midstream, market challenges as a result of low oil prices. In response to these market challenges, we successfully executed our 2016 Restructuring which included cost reductions, mainly from employee headcount reductions and office closures, and the divestiture of our Canadian joint venture interest in BPPC.\nSignificant Events\n2016 Restructuring - As part of the 2016 Restructuring, we recorded pre-tax charges of $16.1 million ($10.3 million post-tax) during 2016 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\n2014 Restructuring - As part of the 2014 Restructuring, we recorded pre-tax charges (credits) of $(0.2) million ($(0.1) million post-tax), $11.0 million ($8.7 million post-tax) and $26.7 million ($22.5 million post-tax) during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These charges exclude long-lived asset impairment charges of $22.8 million in 2014 for the Bayou, Europe and Asia-Pacific reporting units noted below. Including those charges, total 2014 Restructuring pre-tax charges were $49.5 million ($36.2 million post-tax) in 2014 (see Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\nImpairment of goodwill - We recorded pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $43.5 million ($35.7 million post-tax) and $51.5 million ($45.8 million post-tax) during 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report). These charges were recorded as follows:\nEnergy Services Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $33.5 million. In response to contract losses in the Central California upstream energy market during the fourth quarter of 2015 and our subsequent decision to reduce exposure to the upstream market, we performed a market assessment of our energy-related businesses and concluded that sustained low oil prices will continue to create market challenges for the foreseeable future, including a continued reduction in spending by certain of our customers in 2016. The loss of contracts, coupled with the decision to downsize, caused us to perform an interim impairment review of the goodwill and long-lived assets of our operations affected by these circumstances. As a result of the review, we determined that goodwill was impaired; however, there were no impairment charges related to long-lived assets. The Energy Services reporting unit is included in the Energy Services reportable segment.\nCRTS Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash charges of $10.0 million and $5.7 million, respectively. For both periods, we performed an impairment review for goodwill and long-lived assets as a result of customer-driven work delays, work order cancellations and canceled sales opportunities as a result of declining oil prices. In 2015, the impairment resulted from our annual assessment of goodwill. In 2014, the impairment resulted from an interim impairment review. For each period, we determined that goodwill was impaired; however, there were no impairment charges related to long-lived assets in either period. The CRTS reporting unit is included in the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.\nBayou Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $29.7 million. We performed an interim impairment review of Bayou's goodwill as a result of customer-driven work delays, work order cancellations and canceled sales opportunities stemming from declining oil prices. As a result of our review, we determined that goodwill was impaired. The Bayou reporting unit is included in the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.\nFyfe Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $16.1 million as part of our annual impairment assessment for goodwill. Fair value had fallen due to lower long-term expectations for the Fyfe businesses, primarily in North America. As a result of our assessment, we determined that goodwill was impaired. The Fyfe reporting unit is included in the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment.\nImpairment of long-lived assets - During 2014, we recorded pre-tax, non-cash long-lived asset impairment charges of $24.0 million ($14.5 million post-tax) (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report). These charges were recorded as follows:\nBayou, Europe and Asia-Pacific Reporting Units - In the third quarter of 2014, as part of our 2014 Restructuring, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment impairment charges of $11.9 million related to (i) our Bayou and Bayou Delta asset groups within our Bayou reporting unit, (ii) our France asset group within our Europe reporting unit, and (iii) our Malaysia and India asset groups within our Asia-Pacific reporting unit. We\nevaluated the property and equipment of our global operations affected by the 2014 Restructuring and determined that these asset groups were impaired. The Europe and Asia-Pacific reporting units and their related assets groups are included in the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment. Also included in the impairment assessment were Bayou-related intangible assets such as tradenames and customer relationships that were also tested on an undiscounted cash flow basis. Based on the results of the valuation, the carrying amount of the customer relationship intangible asset at Bayou exceeded the fair value and resulted in a full impairment as of September 30, 2014. Accordingly, we recorded a $10.9 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2014.\nFyfe Reporting Unit - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $1.2 million as a result of our annual impairment assessment for goodwill. During the goodwill assessment, the Fyfe reporting unit had a fair value below its carrying value, which caused us to perform an impairment review of long-lived assets. As a result of our review, we determined that the customer relationship intangible asset related to our Fyfe Latin America asset group had been fully impaired.\nBrinderson escrow settlement - During the fourth quarter of 2014, we finalized the settlement ( Brinderson escrow settlement\u201d) of negotiated working capital for the Brinderson acquisition in 2013 as well as escrow claims made pursuant to the purchase agreement. As a result of the settlement, we received proceeds of approximately $5.5 million, $1.0 million of which was recorded as a purchase price adjustment related to working capital, and the remaining $4.5 million was recorded as an offset to operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Brinderson is reported in the Energy Services reportable segment.\nLegal settlement - In December 2016, we settled two lawsuits related to the December 2012 departure of several key leaders in sales and operations for the Tyfo\u00ae Fibrwrap\u00ae technology, which is part of the Infrastructure Solutions platform. Under the settlement, we will receive $6.6 million; and accordingly, recorded the gain to Gain on litigation settlement\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The initial $3.6 million cash payment was received in December 2016 and the remainder is to be paid in $750,000 installments over the next four years.\nDivestitures - In December 2015, we recognized a loss of $0.6 million related to the sale of our 51% joint venture interest in BPPC, which transaction closed in February 2016 (see Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Report).\nIn March 2014, we recognized a loss of $0.5 million related to the sale of our 49% joint venture interest in Bayou Coating.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

8.4%, to $1,221.9 million in 2016 compared to $1,333.6 million in 2015. The decrease in revenues was due to a $90.5 million decline in Energy Services' revenues primarily resulting from our first quarter 2016 decision to downsize our exposure to the upstream energy market due to the effects of lower oil prices and a decrease in refinery clean-up, construction and turnaround activities. Revenues in Corrosion Protection decreased $36.4 million mainly due to (i) a decrease in Canadian upstream, and to a lesser extent midstream, project activity attributable to a decline in client spending on crude oil projects as well as a $25.3 million revenue decline associated with the sale of our Canadian pipe coating joint venture interest in February 2016, (ii) a decrease in domestic upstream project activity and (iii) the completion of certain large international projects performed primarily in 2015 and completed in early 2016. Revenues in Infrastructure Solutions increased $15.3 million primarily due to our acquisition of Underground Solutions in February 2016 and an increase in CIPP contracting installation services activity in North America, partially offset by decreases in FRP project activity in North America and international CIPP contracting installation services activity. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated revenues, as well as individual segment revenues, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit decreased $22.6 million, or 8.2%, to $253.2 million in 2016 compared to $275.8 million in 2015. As part of the 2016 Restructuring and 2014 Restructuring, we recognized charges totaling $0.3 million and $2.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges, gross profit decreased $25.0 million, or 9.0%, to $253.5 million in 2016 compared to $278.5 million in 2015. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a $10.0 million decrease in Corrosion Protection and a $14.5 million decrease in Energy Services primarily due to declines in revenues, as noted above, and added costs associated with certain challenging international projects in Corrosion Protection. Gross profit in Infrastructure Solutions increased $1.8 million largely driven by an increase in CIPP contracting installation services activity in North America and the contribution from Underground Solutions, partially offset by a decline in emergency large diameter pressure pipe projects in our North American FRP business. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated gross profit, as well as individual segment gross profit, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nGross profit margin remained consistent at 20.7% in 2016 and 2015. Excluding restructuring charges, gross profit margin declined 20 basis points to 20.7% in 2016 from 20.9% in 2015. Gross profit margin declined primarily due to the negative impacts from challenging upstream energy market conditions in Corrosion Protection and decreased labor and equipment utilization in our international CIPP operations in Infrastructure Solutions, partially offset by the higher margin contribution from Infrastructure Solutions' Underground Solutions business and improved margins in Energy Services.\nSee Segment Results below for broader discussion regarding changes in gross profit and gross profit margin by segment.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $12.4 million, or 5.9%, to $197.1 million in 2016 compared to $209.5 million in 2015. As part of the 2016 Restructuring and 2014 Restructuring, we recognized charges of $6.2 million and $4.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2015, we recorded a loss reserve of $2.9 million related to a long-dated accounts receivable in Corrosion Protection and a loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in Infrastructure Solutions. Excluding restructuring charges and noted loss reserves, operating expenses decreased $8.5 million, or 4.3%, to $190.9 million in 2016 compared to $199.4 million in 2015.\nThe decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to our restructuring efforts, which generated cost savings mainly in Energy Services' upstream operation and Corrosion Protection's upstream and midstream operations. Included in the decrease in operating expenses was an offset to operating expenses related to favorable reductions in reserves for certain Brinderson pre-acquisition matters in Energy Services and a decrease related to the sale of our Canadian pipe coating operation in Corrosion Protection. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating expenses was an increase in Infrastructure Solutions primarily related to the acquisition of Underground Solutions. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated operating expenses, as well as individual segment operating expenses, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 16.1% and 15.7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding restructuring charges and loss reserves noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.6% and 15.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations\nConsolidated income from continuing operations increased $37.2 million, or 465.0%, to $29.2 million in 2016, from a consolidated loss of $8.0 million in 2015.\nIncluded in consolidated income from continuing operations were the following pre-tax items: (i) 2016 Restructuring and 2014 Restructuring charges of $15.9 million ($10.2 million post-tax) and $11.0 million ($8.7 million post-tax) in 2016 and 2015, respectively, (ii) goodwill impairment charges of $43.5 million ($35.7 million post-tax) in 2015, (iii) loss reserves of $2.9 million ($2.0 million post-tax) in 2015 related to long-dated accounts receivable, (iv) a loss reserve of $2.8 million ($1.7 million post-tax) related to a legal matter in 2015, (v) gain on a litigation settlement of $6.6 million ($4.0 million post-tax) in 2016, (vi) the loss on the sale of BPPC of $0.6 million ($0.4 million post-tax) in 2015 and (vii) acquisition-related expenses of $2.7 million ($2.2 million post-tax) and $1.9 million ($1.2 million post-tax) in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nExcluding the above items, consolidated income from continuing operations decreased $8.2 million, or 17.8%, to $37.9 million in 2016 from $46.1 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to declining revenues and gross profit related to the negative impacts from the low oil price environment in Energy Services and Corrosion Protection, partially offset by an increase in revenues and gross profit in Infrastructure Solutions. Operating expenses favorably impacted consolidated income as a result of operating expense savings associated with our restructuring efforts and decreases in reserves for certain Brinderson pre-acquisition matters noted above, partially offset by the operating expense contribution from Underground Solutions. Consolidated income from continuing operations in 2016, as compared to 2015, was negatively impacted by an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowing costs and higher debt balances, but positively benefited from the $4.2 million reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance due to changes in the realization of future tax benefits. Foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar had an immaterial impact on consolidated income from continuing operations in 2016 compared to 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $2.1 million, or 0.2%, to $1,333.6 million in 2015 compared to $1,331.4 million in 2014. The increase in revenues was primarily due to increased maintenance and turnaround services activity in our downstream operation within Energy Services, increased North American CIPP contracting installation services activity within Infrastructure Solutions, and increased project activity in our pipe coating and insulation operation in Louisiana within Corrosion Protection. Partially offsetting the increase in revenues were negative impacts from foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S dollar which equated to a $51.8 million decline in revenues in 2015 compared to 2014. Revenues also declined as a result of our 2014 Restructuring as we exited or were in the process of exiting, certain under-performing operations located in European and Asia-Pacific regions in 2015. Additionally, revenues declined in our upstream and midstream oil and gas operations within Energy Services and Corrosion Protection.\nGross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit decreased $4.2 million, or 1.5%, to $275.8 million in 2015 compared to $280.0 million in 2014. Excluding 2014 Restructuring charges of $2.7 million and $4.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, within Infrastructure Solutions and long-lived asset impairment charges of $11.3 million in 2014 within Corrosion Protection, gross profit decreased $17.2 million, or 5.8%, to $278.5 million in 2015 compared to $295.7 million in 2014.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross profit by $10.6 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nGross profit margin declined 30 basis points to 20.7% in 2015 from 21.0% in 2014. Excluding 2014 Restructuring charges and long-lived asset impairment charges noted above, gross profit margin declined 130 basis points to 20.9% in 2015 from 22.2% in 2014.\nSee Segment Results below for broader discussion regarding changes in gross profit and gross profit margin by segment.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $24.6 million, or 10.5%, to $209.5 million in 2015 compared to $234.1 million in 2014. In 2015, we recorded a loss reserve of $2.9 million related to a long-dated accounts receivable in Corrosion Protection and a loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in Infrastructure Solutions. In 2014, we recorded a loss reserve of $7.5 million related to a disputed and long-dated accounts receivable in Infrastructure Solutions and an offset to operating expenses of $4.5 million related to the Brinderson escrow settlement in Energy Services. Excluding (i) the loss reserves of $2.9 million and $7.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (ii) the loss reserve of $2.8 million related to a legal matter in 2015, (iii) the Brinderson escrow settlement offset of $4.5 million in 2014, and (iv) 2014 Restructuring charges of $4.4 million and $20.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, within Infrastructure Solutions; operating expenses decreased $11.2 million, or 5.3%, to $199.4 million in 2015 compared to $210.6 million in 2014.\nThe decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of cost savings achieved in our European, Asia-Pacific and North American operations as part of the 2014 Restructuring, as well as favorable impacts from foreign currency rates in\nrelation to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, operating expenses in Corrosion Protection decreased as a result of controlled spending efforts in our operations servicing the upstream market given the challenging market conditions. Partially offsetting these decreasing factors was an increase in operating expenses related to additional staff to support growth in the downstream refining market serviced by Energy Services.\nThe change in foreign currency rates in relation to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted operating expenses by $4.7 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.7% and 17.6% in 2015 and 2014 respectively. Excluding the loss reserve for long-dated accounts receivable, the Brinderson escrow settlement and the 2014 Restructuring charges as noted above, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 15.0% and 15.8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nConsolidated Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations\nConsolidated loss from continuing operations was $8.0 million in 2015, an improvement of $23.6 million, or 74.7%, from a consolidated loss of $31.6 million in 2014.\nIncluded in consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations were the following pre-tax items: (i) 2014 Restructuring charges of $11.0 million ($8.7 million post-tax) and $26.7 million ($22.5 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (ii) goodwill impairment charges of $43.5 million ($35.7 million post-tax) and $51.5 million ($45.8 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, (iii) definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $24.0 million ($14.5 million post-tax) in 2014, (iv) loss reserves of $2.9 million ($2.0 million post-tax) and $7.5 million ($4.5 million post-tax) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to long-dated accounts receivable, (v) a loss reserve of $2.8 million ($1.7 million post-tax) related to a legal matter in 2015, (vi) Brinderson escrow settlement gain of $4.5 million ($2.8 million post-tax)"}
