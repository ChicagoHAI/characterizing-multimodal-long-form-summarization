MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company pioneering an understanding of the non-coding regulatory region of the genome controlling the activation and repression of genes. Our goal is to advance a new wave of medicines to control the expression of genes. We have built a proprietary gene control platform designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA in human disease tissue to identify novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations and to develop drugs against those targets based on our expertise in transcriptional chemistry. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, we believe that our gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across therapeutic areas and a range of diseases. We are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and diseases resulting from modifications of a single gene, also known as monogenic diseases, and are building a pipeline of gene control medicines.\nOur lead product candidates are:\nTable 288: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSY-1425, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RAR\u03b1, agonist that is being evaluated in combination with azacitidine, a hypomethylating agent frequently used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, patients, and with daratumumab, an anti-CD38 therapeutic antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma, in a Phase 2 clinical trial in genomically defined subsets of patients with AML and MDS; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSY-1365, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors for which expansions in ovarian and breast cancer are planned.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also have multiple programs in earlier stages of research and development in oncology, including immuno-oncology, and monogenic diseases. Our goal is to build a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company based on our leadership position in gene control.\nAt the 59th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2017, or ASH 2017, we presented clinical data from our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating SY-1425 as a single agent in defined subsets of AML and MDS patients with our proprietary RARA and IRF8 biomarkers. In the trial, we observed that chronic daily dosing of SY-1425 administered at 6 mg/m2 orally divided in two doses was generally well-tolerated and that clinical and biological activity was observed in patients enrolled in the trial. Specifically, clinical activity was observed in ten of 23 (43%) evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS, including improvement in blood counts, reduction in leukemic blasts and one bone marrow complete response. Thirteen of the 23 (57%) evaluable relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS patients had stable disease. Myeloid differentiation was also observed in the bone marrow, consistent with the underlying mechanism of action of SY-1425 as a differentiating agent. Induction of CD38, a marker of cell differentiation, was observed after one 28-day cycle of treatment in 11 of 13 (85%) patients with pre- and post-treatment immunophenotyping samples.\nWe believe that these clinical data, when combined with preclinical data showing the tumor-killing activity of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine and with daratumumab support the ongoing development of SY-1425 as a combination agent. SY-1425 has shown synergistic tumor-killing activity in combination with azacitidine as well as with daratumumab in preclinical models of RARA biomarker-positive AML. In combination with azacitidine, SY-1425 demonstrated greater clearance of tumor cells in bone marrow and other tissues and greater depth and duration of tumor response in preclinical models, compared to either azacitidine or SY-1425 alone. In combination with daratumumab, SY-1425 induced robust immune cell-mediated tumor death in vitro. Notably, AML cells do not normally express high\nlevels of CD38. We have shown that by inducing CD38 expression, SY-1425 sensitizes biomarker-positive AML models to the tumor-killing effects of daratumumab.\nOur ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial is assessing the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in approximately 25 newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy and in combination with daratumumab in approximately 12 relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS patients. All patients enrolled or to be enrolled in the trial have been or will be prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA or IRF8 biomarkers. In December 2017, we entered into a clinical supply agreement with Janssen Research and Development, LLC, or Janssen, pursuant to which Janssen agreed to supply us daratumumab for use in the trial. We are no longer dosing patients in the cohorts of the trial in which SY-1425 was being evaluated as a single agent. We expect to report initial clinical data from the combination cohorts of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWe are continuing to dose patients in the dose-escalation phase of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-1365 and expect to report data from this phase of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. Once a maximum tolerated dose is reached in the dose escalation phase of the Phase 1 clinical trial and the recommended dosing schedule is identified, we intend to open expansion cohorts evaluating SY-1365 in multiple ovarian cancer populations as a single agent as well as in combination with carboplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent. The ovarian cancer populations include a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in patients who have relapsed after three or more prior therapies, a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 in combination with carboplatin in patients who relapsed after one or more prior therapies but who may still benefit from additional platinum-based treatment, and a 12-patient pilot cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in primary platinum-refractory disease. We also plan to evaluate SY-1365 in combination with fulvestrant, a hormonal medicine, in 12 patients with hormone-receptor positive, HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor. We also plan to evaluate the mechanism of action of SY-1365 in ten patients with any solid tumor accessible for biopsies. We expect that the expansion cohorts in our Phase 1 clinical trial will be open to enrollment in mid-2018.\nWe currently have five programs in our preclinical and discovery pipeline, including preclinical programs directed to the development of a CDK7 inhibitor that can be administered orally, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 12/13, and inhibitors of an immuno-oncology target, as well as discovery programs related to a gene control target to treat sickle cell disease and in the field of cancer. We plan to nominate a development candidate from one of these programs during 2018 that we can advance into preclinical studies to support a potential investigational new drug application, or IND, filing in 2019. We have and are continuing to use our gene control platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, in January 2018 under which we will use our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nRecent Developments\nIncyte Corporation\nIn January 2018, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte. Under this agreement, we will use our gene control platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms, and Incyte will receive options to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to intellectual property resulting from the collaboration for the development and commercialization of therapeutic products directed to up to seven validated targets. Incyte will have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize any therapies under the collaboration that modulate those validated targets.\nUnder the terms of the collaboration agreement, Incyte paid us $10.0 million in up-front consideration, consisting of $2.5 million in cash and $7.5 million in pre-paid research funding. Our activities under this agreement are subject to a joint research plan and, subject to certain exceptions, Incyte will be responsible for funding our activities under the research plan, including amounts in excess of the pre-paid research funding amount. We are eligible to receive target selection milestone payments and option exercise fees of up to an aggregate of $54.0 million if Incyte selects the maximum number of targets for validation and exercises its option to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property for therapeutic products directed to all seven validated targets. Should any therapeutic product be developed by Incyte against a target as to which Incyte has exercised its option to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property, we will be eligible to receive milestone payments and, if approved and commercialized, royalty payments from Incyte. For each of the seven validated targets, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte a total of up to $50.0\nmillion in development and regulatory milestone payments. If products arising from the collaboration are approved, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte, for each validated target, a total of up to $65.0 million in commercial milestone payments. Upon approval and commercialization of any therapeutic product resulting from the collaboration, we would become eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on net sales of such product.\nIn connection with the collaboration agreement, we sold 793,021 shares of our common stock to Incyte for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million in cash, or $12.61 per share, in a private placement. In addition, from the closing of this sale until the earlier of the second anniversary of such closing or the expiration or termination of the collaboration agreement, we have granted to Incyte the right to purchase up to its pro rata share of the securities offered in certain subsequent offerings of our common stock or common stock equivalents, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement. In February 2018, we sold 144,505 additional shares of our common stock to Incyte at a price of $9.55 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $1.4 million.\nPublic Offering\nOn January 30, 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,188,481 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price per share $9.55 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $40.0 million before deducting underwriting commissions and fees estimated to be approximately $2.7 million. Additionally, on February 2, 2018, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 628,272 shares at a price per share of $9.55, resulting in additional gross proceeds of $6.0 million.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our only source of revenue to date has been a research agreement with a multinational pharmaceutical company. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in revenue related to this agreement. This research agreement expired on March 31, 2017 in accordance with its terms.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including development of our gene control platform and the development of product candidates, which include:\nTable 290: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nemployee-related expenses including salaries and benefits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nstock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexternal costs of funding activities performed by third parties that conduct research and development on our behalf and of purchasing supplies used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nconsulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfacilities costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other operating costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments made to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or certain external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program, as well as expenses not allocated to programs, for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSY-1425 external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSY-1365 and other CDK7 program external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther research and platform programs external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEmployee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacilities and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance our programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 296: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsuccessful completion of preclinical studies, including activities related to an IND and minimally efficacious dose studies in animals, where applicable and requested under the good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements of the FDA;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\napproval of INDs for our product candidates to commence planned or future clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsuccessful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsuccessful data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable benefit-risk profile of our product candidates in the intended populations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nsuccessful development, and subsequent clearance or approval, of companion diagnostic tests for use in identifying potential patients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nreceipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nestablishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nestablishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncommercial launch of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nenforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmaintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nretention of key research and development personnel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, compliance and director and officer insurance costs, as well as investor and public relations expenses, associated with operating as a public company.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists of interest income on our cash and cash equivalents, interest, dividends, amortization of premiums and discounts, realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities and interest expense related to our equipment financing arrangement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605 Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met:\nTable 308: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\npersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndelivery has occurred or services have been rendered;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncollectability is reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe analyze multiple element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and we are required to make judgements about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separate from other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially within our control.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, we recognize revenue from the combined unit of accounting over the contractual or estimated performance period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period we are expected to\ncomplete our performance obligations or upon completion when the final act is of such significance to the overall arrangement that performance has not substantively occurred until the completion of that act. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method.\nThe research agreement we entered with a multinational pharmaceutical company contained a single unit of accounting and we recognized service revenue based upon the completed performance method of revenue recognition as we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of performance of the services and the delivery of the final study report was significant to the arrangement.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual\nmilestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our service providers in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe record our expenses related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nWe have and may in the future in-license the rights to develop and commercialize product candidates. For each in-license transaction we evaluate whether we have acquired processes or activities along with inputs that would be sufficient to constitute a \u2018\u2018business'' as defined under U.S. GAAP. A business\u201d as defined under U.S. GAAP consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities to qualify as a business. When we determine that we have not acquired sufficient processes or activities to constitute a business, any up-front payments, as well as milestone payments, are immediately expensed as acquired research and development in the period in which they are incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Prior to June 30, 2016, we were a privately-held company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. As such, we utilize data from a representative group of public companies to estimate expected stock price volatility. For purposes of identifying representative companies, we considered characteristics such as number of product candidates in early stages of product development, area of therapeutic focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The expected volatility was determined using an average of the historical volatilities of the representative group of companies for a period equal to the expected term of the option grant. We intend to consistently apply this process using the same representative companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\nWe use the \u2018\u2018simplified method'' to estimate the expected term of stock option grants to employees. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the \u2018\u2018plain-vanilla'' nature of our stock-based awards. The risk-free rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant with periods commensurate with the expected term of the options being\nvalued. We have never paid, and do not anticipate paying, any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option-pricing model.\nPrior to becoming a public company, we determined the fair value of our common stock using the option pricing method, or OPM, or a hybrid of the probability-weighted expected return method and OPM. The fair value of our common stock underlying our stock-based awards was determined on each grant date by our board of directors. Upon becoming a public company, the fair value of the underlying shares of common stock equals the closing price of our stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, effective January 1, 2017, we account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant and revising those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from its estimates. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will be for only those options that vest.\nWe have computed the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted-average risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.07\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.36\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.78\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected option term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVolatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.83\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n85.39\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n82.71\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees on a straight-line basis over the associated service period, which is generally the vesting period. For stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which the services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock for restricted stock and updated assumptions in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options.\nWe record the expense for stock-based awards that contain performance-based milestones in accordance with the accelerated attribution model. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date. For certain of our performance-based awards, notwithstanding any vesting in accordance with the achievement of performance-based milestones, such awards vest in full on the sixth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Compensation expense for such awards is recognized over the six-year vesting period unless management determines that the achievement of any performance-based milestones are probable, in which case expense is accelerated.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStatements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(54,010)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(47,743)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nIn November 2014, we entered into a research agreement with a multinational pharmaceutical company for purposes of mapping immune cell super-enhancers and transcriptional targets in autoimmune disease.

The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to sales and maturities of marketable securities of $27.0 million during 2017 compared to no sales or maturities of marketable securities during 2016, offset by an increase in purchases of marketable securities during 2017.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $27.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to purchases of marketable securities as well as increased purchases of property and equipment associated with our corporate headquarters.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $33.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $90.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the issuance of common stock in connection with the IPO in July 2016, as well as the issuance of $39.8 million in a preferred stock financing in January 2016, offset by gross proceeds of $35.0 million in connection with the sale of common stock through private placement in April 2017.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $90.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of common stock in connection with the IPO in July 2016, as well as the issuance of $39.8 million in a preferred stock financing in January 2016.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue clinical trials of SY-1425 and SY-1365, seek to develop companion diagnostic tests for use with our product candidates, initiate new research and preclinical development efforts and seek marketing approval for any product candidates that we successfully develop. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to establishing sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such products. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, eliminate, or out-license our research and development programs or future commercialization rights to our product candidates.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017, together with amounts received from Incyte in connection with our collaboration and option agreement executed in January 2018 and the net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock and concurrent private placement of our common stock to Incyte that closed in February 2018, will enable us to fund our planned operating expense and capital expenditure requirements into 2020. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 328: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of SY-1425 and SY-1365 and any associated companion diagnostic tests;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nresearch and preclinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 330: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour ability to enter into and the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwhether our collaboration with Incyte will yield any validated targets, whether Incyte will exercise any of its options to exclusively license intellectual property directed to such targets, and whether and when any of the target validation fees, option exercise fees, milestone payments or royalties under the collaboration agreement with Incyte will ever be paid;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of acquiring potential new product candidates or technology;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to licensors for patent and technology rights used in our development platform;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrevenue received from commercial sales, if any, of our current and future product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development, operate as a public company, and establish a commercial infrastructure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe costs of operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs December 31, 2017, we have a capital lease for laboratory equipment that expires in March 2018 and a capital lease for office equipment that ends in April 2020. Additionally, we lease office space at 620 Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts under a non-cancellable operating lease that expires in October 2020.

We have not included these future payments in the table of contractual obligations above since the contracts are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 to 90 days prior written notice.\nOur license agreements include potential milestone payments that are contingent upon the successful development and commercialization of products using the intellectual property licensed under such agreements. Under our agreements with Dana-Farber and Whitehead, the maximum aggregate potential milestone payments payable by us total approximately $6.9 million. Under the applicable agreement, we are also required to pay annual maintenance fees, as well as tiered, single digit percentage royalties, on a country-by-country, product-by-product basis, on net product sales.\nUnder the amended and restated TMRC license agreement, we may make additional payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical and regulatory milestones in an aggregate amount of approximately $13.0 million per indication. In May 2016, we paid TMRC $0.5 million representing the balance of the remaining upfront license fee and in September 2016, we made a $1.0 million milestone payment to TMRC upon the successful dosing of the first patient in our Phase 2 clinical trial of SY-1425.\nWe also entered into a supply arrangement with TMRC, under which the Company agreed to pay TMRC a fee for each kilogram of SY-1425 active pharmaceutical ingredient that is produced. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid TMRC $0.4 million in payments related to this agreement. No payments were made under this supply management arrangement during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules.\nJOBS Act\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company, or EGC, can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nAs an EGC, we intend to rely on the exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and with the exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the\nlast day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the closing of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under SEC rules.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a biopharmaceutical company's financial condition and operational results, including its focus on developing gene control medicines for cancer and monogenic diseases.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company pioneering an understanding of the non-coding regulatory region of the genome controlling the activation and repression of genes. Our goal is to advance a new wave of medicines to control the expression of genes. We have built a proprietary gene control platform designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA in human disease tissue to identify novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations and to develop drugs against those targets based on our expertise in transcriptional chemistry. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, we believe that our gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across therapeutic areas and a range of diseases. We are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and diseases resulting from modifications of a single gene, also known as monogenic diseases, and are building a pipeline of gene control medicines.\nOur lead product candidates are:\n \u00b7 SY-1425, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RAR\u03b1, agonist that is being evaluated in combination with azacitidine, a hypomethylating agent frequently used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, patients, and with daratumumab, an anti-CD38 therapeutic antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma, in a Phase 2 clinical trial in genomically defined subsets of patients with AML and MDS; and \n \u00b7 SY-1365, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors for which expansions in ovarian and breast cancer are planned. \nWe also have multiple programs in earlier stages of research and development in oncology, including immuno-oncology, and monogenic diseases. Our goal is to build a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company based on our leadership position in gene control.\nAt the 59th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2017, or ASH 2017, we presented clinical data from our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating SY-1425 as a single agent in defined subsets of AML and MDS patients with our proprietary RARA and IRF8 biomarkers. In the trial, we observed that chronic daily dosing of SY-1425 administered at 6 mg/m2 orally divided in two doses was generally well-tolerated and that clinical and biological activity was observed in patients enrolled in the trial. Specifically, clinical activity was observed in ten of 23 (43%) evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS, including improvement in blood counts, reduction in leukemic blasts and one bone marrow complete response. Thirteen of the 23 (57%) evaluable relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS patients had stable disease. Myeloid differentiation was also observed in the bone marrow, consistent with the underlying mechanism of action of SY-1425 as a differentiating agent. Induction of CD38, a marker of cell differentiation, was observed after one 28-day cycle of treatment in 11 of 13 (85%) patients with pre- and post-treatment immunophenotyping samples.\nWe believe that these clinical data, when combined with preclinical data showing the tumor-killing activity of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine and with daratumumab support the ongoing development of SY-1425 as a combination agent. SY-1425 has shown synergistic tumor-killing activity in combination with azacitidine as well as with daratumumab in preclinical models of RARA biomarker-positive AML. In combination with azacitidine, SY-1425 demonstrated greater clearance of tumor cells in bone marrow and other tissues and greater depth and duration of tumor response in preclinical models, compared to either azacitidine or SY-1425 alone. In combination with daratumumab, SY-1425 induced robust immune cell-mediated tumor death in vitro. Notably, AML cells do not normally express high\nlevels of CD38. We have shown that by inducing CD38 expression, SY-1425 sensitizes biomarker-positive AML models to the tumor-killing effects of daratumumab.\nOur ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial is assessing the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in approximately 25 newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy and in combination with daratumumab in approximately 12 relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS patients. All patients enrolled or to be enrolled in the trial have been or will be prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA or IRF8 biomarkers. In December 2017, we entered into a clinical supply agreement with Janssen Research and Development, LLC, or Janssen, pursuant to which Janssen agreed to supply us daratumumab for use in the trial. We are no longer dosing patients in the cohorts of the trial in which SY-1425 was being evaluated as a single agent. We expect to report initial clinical data from the combination cohorts of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWe are continuing to dose patients in the dose-escalation phase of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-1365 and expect to report data from this phase of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. Once a maximum tolerated dose is reached in the dose escalation phase of the Phase 1 clinical trial and the recommended dosing schedule is identified, we intend to open expansion cohorts evaluating SY-1365 in multiple ovarian cancer populations as a single agent as well as in combination with carboplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent. The ovarian cancer populations include a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in patients who have relapsed after three or more prior therapies, a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 in combination with carboplatin in patients who relapsed after one or more prior therapies but who may still benefit from additional platinum-based treatment, and a 12-patient pilot cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in primary platinum-refractory disease. We also plan to evaluate SY-1365 in combination with fulvestrant, a hormonal medicine, in 12 patients with hormone-receptor positive, HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor. We also plan to evaluate the mechanism of action of SY-1365 in ten patients with any solid tumor accessible for biopsies. We expect that the expansion cohorts in our Phase 1 clinical trial will be open to enrollment in mid-2018.\nWe currently have five programs in our preclinical and discovery pipeline, including preclinical programs directed to the development of a CDK7 inhibitor that can be administered orally, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 12/13, and inhibitors of an immuno-oncology target, as well as discovery programs related to a gene control target to treat sickle cell disease and in the field of cancer. We plan to nominate a development candidate from one of these programs during 2018 that we can advance into preclinical studies to support a potential investigational new drug application, or IND, filing in 2019. We have and are continuing to use our gene control platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, in January 2018 under which we will use our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nRecent Developments\nIncyte Corporation\nIn January 2018, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte. Under this agreement, we will use our gene control platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms, and Incyte will receive options to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to intellectual property resulting from the collaboration for the development and commercialization of therapeutic products directed to up to seven validated targets. Incyte will have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize any therapies under the collaboration that modulate those validated targets.\nUnder the terms of the collaboration agreement, Incyte paid us $10.0 million in up-front consideration, consisting of $2.5 million in cash and $7.5 million in pre-paid research funding. Our activities under this agreement are subject to a joint research plan and, subject to certain exceptions, Incyte will be responsible for funding our activities under the research plan, including amounts in excess of the pre-paid research funding amount. We are eligible to receive target selection milestone payments and option exercise fees of up to an aggregate of $54.0 million if Incyte selects the maximum number of targets for validation and exercises its option to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property for therapeutic products directed to all seven validated targets. Should any therapeutic product be developed by Incyte against a target as to which Incyte has exercised its option to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property, we will be eligible to receive milestone payments and, if approved and commercialized, royalty payments from Incyte. For each of the seven validated targets, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte a total of up to $50.0\nmillion in development and regulatory milestone payments. If products arising from the collaboration are approved, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte, for each validated target, a total of up to $65.0 million in commercial milestone payments. Upon approval and commercialization of any therapeutic product resulting from the collaboration, we would become eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on net sales of such product.\nIn connection with the collaboration agreement, we sold 793,021 shares of our common stock to Incyte for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million in cash, or $12.61 per share, in a private placement. In addition, from the closing of this sale until the earlier of the second anniversary of such closing or the expiration or termination of the collaboration agreement, we have granted to Incyte the right to purchase up to its pro rata share of the securities offered in certain subsequent offerings of our common stock or common stock equivalents, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement. In February 2018, we sold 144,505 additional shares of our common stock to Incyte at a price of $9.55 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $1.4 million.\nPublic Offering\nOn January 30, 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,188,481 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price per share $9.55 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $40.0 million before deducting underwriting commissions and fees estimated to be approximately $2.7 million. Additionally, on February 2, 2018, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 628,272 shares at a price per share of $9.55, resulting in additional gross proceeds of $6.0 million.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our only source of revenue to date has been a research agreement with a multinational pharmaceutical company. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in revenue related to this agreement. This research agreement expired on March 31, 2017 in accordance with its terms.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including development of our gene control platform and the development of product candidates, which include:\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses including salaries and benefits; \n \u00b7 stock-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 external costs of funding activities performed by third parties that conduct research and development on our behalf and of purchasing supplies used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; \n \u00b7 consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; and \n \u00b7 facilities costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other operating costs. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments made to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or certain external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program, as well as expenses not allocated to programs, for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance our programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n \u00b7 successful completion of preclinical studies, including activities related to an IND and minimally efficacious dose studies in animals, where applicable and requested under the good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements of the FDA; \n \u00b7 approval of INDs for our product candidates to commence planned or future clinical trials; \n \u00b7 successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; \n \u00b7 successful data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable benefit-risk profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; \n \u00b7 successful development, and subsequent clearance or approval, of companion diagnostic tests for use in identifying potential patients; \n \u00b7 receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u00b7 establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities; \n \u00b7 establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \n \u00b7 commercial launch of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u00b7 enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims; \n \u00b7 maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; and \n \u00b7 retention of key research and development personnel. \nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, compliance and director and officer insurance costs, as well as investor and public relations expenses, associated with operating as a public company.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists of interest income on our cash and cash equivalents, interest, dividends, amortization of premiums and discounts, realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities and interest expense related to our equipment financing arrangement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605 Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met:\n \u00b7 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u00b7 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; \n \u00b7 the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and \n \u00b7 collectability is reasonably assured. \nWe analyze multiple element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and we are required to make judgements about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separate from other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially within our control.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, we recognize revenue from the combined unit of accounting over the contractual or estimated performance period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period we are expected to\ncomplete our performance obligations or upon completion when the final act is of such significance to the overall arrangement that performance has not substantively occurred until the completion of that act. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method.\nThe research agreement we entered with a multinational pharmaceutical company contained a single unit of accounting and we recognized service revenue based upon the completed performance method of revenue recognition as we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of performance of the services and the delivery of the final study report was significant to the arrangement.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual\nmilestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our service providers in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe record our expenses related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nWe have and may in the future in-license the rights to develop and commercialize product candidates. For each in-license transaction we evaluate whether we have acquired processes or activities along with inputs that would be sufficient to constitute a \u2018\u2018business'' as defined under U.S. GAAP. A business\u201d as defined under U.S. GAAP consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities to qualify as a business. When we determine that we have not acquired sufficient processes or activities to constitute a business, any up-front payments, as well as milestone payments, are immediately expensed as acquired research and development in the period in which they are incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Prior to June 30, 2016, we were a privately-held company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. As such, we utilize data from a representative group of public companies to estimate expected stock price volatility. For purposes of identifying representative companies, we considered characteristics such as number of product candidates in early stages of product development, area of therapeutic focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The expected volatility was determined using an average of the historical volatilities of the representative group of companies for a period equal to the expected term of the option grant. We intend to consistently apply this process using the same representative companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\nWe use the \u2018\u2018simplified method'' to estimate the expected term of stock option grants to employees. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the \u2018\u2018plain-vanilla'' nature of our stock-based awards. The risk-free rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant with periods commensurate with the expected term of the options being\nvalued. We have never paid, and do not anticipate paying, any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option-pricing model.\nPrior to becoming a public company, we determined the fair value of our common stock using the option pricing method, or OPM, or a hybrid of the probability-weighted expected return method and OPM. The fair value of our common stock underlying our stock-based awards was determined on each grant date by our board of directors. Upon becoming a public company, the fair value of the underlying shares of common stock equals the closing price of our stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, effective January 1, 2017, we account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant and revising those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from its estimates. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will be for only those options that vest.\nWe have computed the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:\n\nWe expense the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees on a straight-line basis over the associated service period, which is generally the vesting period. For stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which the services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock for restricted stock and updated assumptions in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options.\nWe record the expense for stock-based awards that contain performance-based milestones in accordance with the accelerated attribution model. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date. For certain of our performance-based awards, notwithstanding any vesting in accordance with the achievement of performance-based milestones, such awards vest in full on the sixth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Compensation expense for such awards is recognized over the six-year vesting period unless management determines that the achievement of any performance-based milestones are probable, in which case expense is accelerated.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\nTable", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company pioneering an understanding of the non-coding regulatory region of the genome controlling the activation and repression of genes. Our goal is to advance a new wave of medicines to control the expression of genes. We have built a proprietary gene control platform designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA in human disease tissue to identify novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations and to develop drugs against those targets based on our expertise in transcriptional chemistry. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, we believe that our gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across therapeutic areas and a range of diseases. We are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and diseases resulting from modifications of a single gene, also known as monogenic diseases, and are building a pipeline of gene control medicines.\nOur lead product candidates are:\n \u00b7 SY-1425, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RAR\u03b1, agonist that is being evaluated in combination with azacitidine, a hypomethylating agent frequently used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, patients, and with daratumumab, an anti-CD38 therapeutic antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma, in a Phase 2 clinical trial in genomically defined subsets of patients with AML and MDS; and \n \u00b7 SY-1365, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors for which expansions in ovarian and breast cancer are planned. \nWe also have multiple programs in earlier stages of research and development in oncology, including immuno-oncology, and monogenic diseases. Our goal is to build a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company based on our leadership position in gene control.\nAt the 59th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2017, or ASH 2017, we presented clinical data from our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating SY-1425 as a single agent in defined subsets of AML and MDS patients with our proprietary RARA and IRF8 biomarkers. In the trial, we observed that chronic daily dosing of SY-1425 administered at 6 mg/m2 orally divided in two doses was generally well-tolerated and that clinical and biological activity was observed in patients enrolled in the trial. Specifically, clinical activity was observed in ten of 23 (43%) evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS, including improvement in blood counts, reduction in leukemic blasts and one bone marrow complete response. Thirteen of the 23 (57%) evaluable relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS patients had stable disease. Myeloid differentiation was also observed in the bone marrow, consistent with the underlying mechanism of action of SY-1425 as a differentiating agent. Induction of CD38, a marker of cell differentiation, was observed after one 28-day cycle of treatment in 11 of 13 (85%) patients with pre- and post-treatment immunophenotyping samples.\nWe believe that these clinical data, when combined with preclinical data showing the tumor-killing activity of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine and with daratumumab support the ongoing development of SY-1425 as a combination agent. SY-1425 has shown synergistic tumor-killing activity in combination with azacitidine as well as with daratumumab in preclinical models of RARA biomarker-positive AML. In combination with azacitidine, SY-1425 demonstrated greater clearance of tumor cells in bone marrow and other tissues and greater depth and duration of tumor response in preclinical models, compared to either azacitidine or SY-1425 alone. In combination with daratumumab, SY-1425 induced robust immune cell-mediated tumor death in vitro. Notably, AML cells do not normally express high\nlevels of CD38. We have shown that by inducing CD38 expression, SY-1425 sensitizes biomarker-positive AML models to the tumor-killing effects of daratumumab.\nOur ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial is assessing the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in approximately 25 newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy and in combination with daratumumab in approximately 12 relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS patients. All patients enrolled or to be enrolled in the trial have been or will be prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA or IRF8 biomarkers. In December 2017, we entered into a clinical supply agreement with Janssen Research and Development, LLC, or Janssen, pursuant to which Janssen agreed to supply us daratumumab for use in the trial. We are no longer dosing patients in the cohorts of the trial in which SY-1425 was being evaluated as a single agent. We expect to report initial clinical data from the combination cohorts of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWe are continuing to dose patients in the dose-escalation phase of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-1365 and expect to report data from this phase of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. Once a maximum tolerated dose is reached in the dose escalation phase of the Phase 1 clinical trial and the recommended dosing schedule is identified, we intend to open expansion cohorts evaluating SY-1365 in multiple ovarian cancer populations as a single agent as well as in combination with carboplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent. The ovarian cancer populations include a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in patients who have relapsed after three or more prior therapies, a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 in combination with carboplatin in patients who relapsed after one or more prior therapies but who may still benefit from additional platinum-based treatment, and a 12-patient pilot cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in primary platinum-refractory disease. We also plan to evaluate SY-1365 in combination with fulvestrant, a hormonal medicine, in 12 patients with hormone-receptor positive, HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor. We also plan to evaluate the mechanism of action of SY-1365 in ten patients with any solid tumor accessible for biopsies. We expect that the expansion cohorts in our Phase 1 clinical trial will be open to enrollment in mid-2018.\nWe currently have five programs in our preclinical and discovery pipeline, including preclinical programs directed to the development of a CDK7 inhibitor that can be administered orally, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 12/13, and inhibitors of an immuno-oncology target, as well as discovery programs related to a gene control target to treat sickle cell disease and in the field of cancer. We plan to nominate a development candidate from one of these programs during 2018 that we can advance into preclinical studies to support a potential investigational new drug application, or IND, filing in 2019. We have and are continuing to use our gene control platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, in January 2018 under which we will use our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nRecent Developments\nIncyte Corporation\nIn January 2018, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte. Under this agreement, we will use our gene control platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms, and Incyte will receive options to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to intellectual property resulting from the collaboration for the development and commercialization of therapeutic products directed to up to seven validated targets. Incyte will have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize any therapies under the collaboration that modulate those validated targets.\nUnder the terms of the collaboration agreement, Incyte paid us $10.0 million in up-front consideration, consisting of $2.5 million in cash and $7.5 million in pre-paid research funding. Our activities under this agreement are subject to a joint research plan and, subject to certain exceptions, Incyte will be responsible for funding our activities under the research plan, including amounts in excess of the pre-paid research funding amount. We are eligible to receive target selection milestone payments and option exercise fees of up to an aggregate of $54.0 million if Incyte selects the maximum number of targets for validation and exercises its option to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property for therapeutic products directed to all seven validated targets. Should any therapeutic product be developed by Incyte against a target as to which Incyte has exercised its option to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property, we will be eligible to receive milestone payments and, if approved and commercialized, royalty payments from Incyte. For each of the seven validated targets, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte a total of up to $50.0\nmillion in development and regulatory milestone payments. If products arising from the collaboration are approved, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte, for each validated target, a total of up to $65.0 million in commercial milestone payments. Upon approval and commercialization of any therapeutic product resulting from the collaboration, we would become eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on net sales of such product.\nIn connection with the collaboration agreement, we sold 793,021 shares of our common stock to Incyte for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million in cash, or $12.61 per share, in a private placement. In addition, from the closing of this sale until the earlier of the second anniversary of such closing or the expiration or termination of the collaboration agreement, we have granted to Incyte the right to purchase up to its pro rata share of the securities offered in certain subsequent offerings of our common stock or common stock equivalents, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement. In February 2018, we sold 144,505 additional shares of our common stock to Incyte at a price of $9.55 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $1.4 million.\nPublic Offering\nOn January 30, 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,188,481 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price per share $9.55 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $40.0 million before deducting underwriting commissions and fees estimated to be approximately $2.7 million. Additionally, on February 2, 2018, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 628,272 shares at a price per share of $9.55, resulting in additional gross proceeds of $6.0 million.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our only source of revenue to date has been a research agreement with a multinational pharmaceutical company. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in revenue related to this agreement. This research agreement expired on March 31, 2017 in accordance with its terms.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including development of our gene control platform and the development of product candidates, which include:\n \u00b7 employee-related expenses including salaries and benefits; \n \u00b7 stock-based compensation expense; \n \u00b7 external costs of funding activities performed by third parties that conduct research and development on our behalf and of purchasing supplies used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; \n \u00b7 consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities; and \n \u00b7 facilities costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other operating costs. \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments made to vendors for goods or services that will be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nWe typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our research and development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, other internal costs or certain external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our external research and development expenses by program, as well as expenses not allocated to programs, for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSY-1425 external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSY-1365 and other CDK7 program external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther research and platform programs external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEmployee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFacilities and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n37,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance our programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing such product candidates, including the uncertainty of:\n \u00b7 successful completion of preclinical studies, including activities related to an IND and minimally efficacious dose studies in animals, where applicable and requested under the good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements of the FDA; \n \u00b7 approval of INDs for our product candidates to commence planned or future clinical trials; \n \u00b7 successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; \n \u00b7 successful data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable benefit-risk profile of our product candidates in the intended populations; \n \u00b7 successful development, and subsequent clearance or approval, of companion diagnostic tests for use in identifying potential patients; \n \u00b7 receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; \n \u00b7 establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing and, where applicable, commercial manufacturing capabilities; \n \u00b7 establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; \n \u00b7 commercial launch of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \n \u00b7 enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims; \n \u00b7 maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; and \n \u00b7 retention of key research and development personnel. \nAny changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. Other significant costs include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees related to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, compliance and director and officer insurance costs, as well as investor and public relations expenses, associated with operating as a public company.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists of interest income on our cash and cash equivalents, interest, dividends, amortization of premiums and discounts, realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities and interest expense related to our equipment financing arrangement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, will be reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605 Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605. Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met:\n \u00b7 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; \n \u00b7 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; \n \u00b7 the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and \n \u00b7 collectability is reasonably assured. \nWe analyze multiple element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple element arrangements to determine (1) the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2) whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and we are required to make judgements about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separate from other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially within our control.\nWe recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, we recognize revenue from the combined unit of accounting over the contractual or estimated performance period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period we are expected to\ncomplete our performance obligations or upon completion when the final act is of such significance to the overall arrangement that performance has not substantively occurred until the completion of that act. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method.\nThe research agreement we entered with a multinational pharmaceutical company contained a single unit of accounting and we recognized service revenue based upon the completed performance method of revenue recognition as we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of performance of the services and the delivery of the final study report was significant to the arrangement.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual\nmilestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our service providers in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe record our expenses related to research and development activities based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development, until related goods or services are provided.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nWe have and may in the future in-license the rights to develop and commercialize product candidates. For each in-license transaction we evaluate whether we have acquired processes or activities along with inputs that would be sufficient to constitute a \u2018\u2018business'' as defined under U.S. GAAP. A business\u201d as defined under U.S. GAAP consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Although businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities to qualify as a business. When we determine that we have not acquired sufficient processes or activities to constitute a business, any up-front payments, as well as milestone payments, are immediately expensed as acquired research and development in the period in which they are incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. Calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Prior to June 30, 2016, we were a privately-held company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. As such, we utilize data from a representative group of public companies to estimate expected stock price volatility. For purposes of identifying representative companies, we considered characteristics such as number of product candidates in early stages of product development, area of therapeutic focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The expected volatility was determined using an average of the historical volatilities of the representative group of companies for a period equal to the expected term of the option grant. We intend to consistently apply this process using the same representative companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\nWe use the \u2018\u2018simplified method'' to estimate the expected term of stock option grants to employees. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the \u2018\u2018plain-vanilla'' nature of our stock-based awards. The risk-free rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant with periods commensurate with the expected term of the options being\nvalued. We have never paid, and do not anticipate paying, any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option-pricing model.\nPrior to becoming a public company, we determined the fair value of our common stock using the option pricing method, or OPM, or a hybrid of the probability-weighted expected return method and OPM. The fair value of our common stock underlying our stock-based awards was determined on each grant date by our board of directors. Upon becoming a public company, the fair value of the underlying shares of common stock equals the closing price of our stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, effective January 1, 2017, we account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures at the time of grant and revising those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from its estimates. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will be for only those options that vest.\nWe have computed the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted-average risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.07\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.36\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n1.78\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected option term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nVolatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.83\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n85.39\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n82.71\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees on a straight-line basis over the associated service period, which is generally the vesting period. For stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which the services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using the then-current fair value of our common stock for restricted stock and updated assumptions in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options.\nWe record the expense for stock-based awards that contain performance-based milestones in accordance with the accelerated attribution model. Management evaluates when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable based on the expected satisfaction of the performance conditions as of the reporting date. For certain of our performance-based awards, notwithstanding any vesting in accordance with the achievement of performance-based milestones, such awards vest in full on the sixth anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Compensation expense for such awards is recognized over the six-year vesting period unless management determines that the achievement of any performance-based milestones are probable, in which case expense is accelerated.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, together with the changes in those items in dollars (in thousands):\nTable"}
