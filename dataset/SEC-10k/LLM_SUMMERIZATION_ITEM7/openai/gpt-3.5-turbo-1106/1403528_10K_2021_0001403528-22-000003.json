Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC and the related notes included within this annual report. For a discussion and analysis of historical periods ended before January 1, 2020, please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. The factors listed under Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this annual report provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in any forward-looking statements.\nBusiness Overview\nOaktree is a leading global alternative investment management firm with expertise in investing in credit, real assets, private equity, and listed equities. Oaktree's mission is to deliver superior investment results with risk under control and to conduct its business with the highest integrity. Oaktree emphasizes an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to its investments. Over more than three decades, Oaktree has developed a large and growing client base through its ability to identify and capitalize on opportunities for attractive investment returns in less efficient markets.\nOaktree was formed in 1995 by a group of individuals who had been investing together since the mid-1980s. Oaktree's founders were pioneers in the management of high yield bonds, convertible securities and distressed debt. From those roots Oaktree has developed a diversified mix of specialized credit- and equity-oriented strategies. Oaktree operates according to a unifying investment philosophy, which consists of six tenets-risk control, consistency, market inefficiency, specialization, bottom-up analysis and disavowal of market timing-and is complemented by a set of core business principles that articulate our commitment to excellence in investing, commonality of interests with clients, a collaborative and cooperative culture, and a disciplined, opportunistic approach to the expansion of products.\nBusiness Environment and Developments\nAs a global investment manager, Oaktree is affected by a wide range of factors, including the condition of the global economy and financial markets; the relative attractiveness of Oaktree's investment strategies and investors' demand for them; and regulatory or other governmental policies or actions. Global economic conditions can significantly impact the values of Oaktree's and its funds' investments and the ability to make new investments or sell existing investments for these funds. Historically, however, Oaktree's diversified nature, of both its investment strategies and revenue mix, has generally allowed it to benefit from both strong and weak economic environments. Weak economies and the declining financial markets that typically accompany them tend to dampen revenues from asset-based management fees, investment realizations or price appreciation, but their prospect can present opportunities to raise relatively larger amounts of capital for certain strategies, especially opportunistic credit. Additionally, weak financial markets may also present more opportunities for funds to make investments at reduced prices. Conversely, strong financial markets generally increase the value of fund investments, which positions Oaktree, and us, for growth in management fees that are based on asset value, and typically create favorable exit opportunities that enhance the prospect for incentive income and fund-related realized investment income proceeds. Those same markets may delay or diminish opportunities to deploy capital and thus management fees from certain funds.\nCOVID-19 continues to pose serious threats to the health and economic wellbeing of the worldwide population and the overall economy in light of COVID-19 variants that seem to spread more easily than the original COVID-19 virus. The number of reported COVID-19 infections are rising again in certain countries worldwide likely due to these variants and the relaxation of certain efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 previously imposed by governmental authorities. While the equity markets have rebounded from their steep declines in March 2020 after the World Health Organization announced that infections of COVID-19 had become a pandemic, there is continued uncertainty as to the duration of the global health and economic impact caused by COVID-19 even with COVID-19 vaccines now available. Actions at the outset of the pandemic that were intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and the worldwide efforts to isolate at home and practice social distancing caused a dramatic increase in unemployment and economic instability in the United States and in certain other regions in which Oaktree operates. While such instability in certain parts of the world, including in the United States, have shown signs of recovery in large part because of the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the continued uncertainty of COVID-19 variants may lead to renewed governmental efforts to mitigate COVID-19 spread seen at the beginning of the pandemic. Such\nrenewed mitigation efforts would create significant uncertainty and volatility in Oaktree's business and its funds' and their respective portfolio companies' businesses as compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nProlonged difficult market and economic conditions and uncertainty caused by COVID-19 will adversely impact the valuations of Oaktree's and its funds' investments, particularly if the value of an investment is determined in whole or in part by reference to public equity, public debt, or private debt markets. However, while any market dislocation caused by COVID-19 will adversely impact the value of Oaktree's and its funds' investments, the increased volatility in the financial markets may also present attractive investment opportunities for certain Oaktree investment strategies. Currently, we are unaware of any material risk to the stability of our condensed consolidated financial statements caused by any COVID-19 uncertainties or the materiality of any effect such uncertainties may have on our business and operations. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors- The coronavirus pandemic ( COVID-19\u201d) has significantly disrupted economic conditions and may adversely affect our operations, business, financial performance and operating results\" within this annual report.\nBrookfield Merger\nOn March 13, 2019, Oaktree, Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario ( Brookfield\u201d), Berlin Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Merger Sub\u201d) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield, Oslo Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( SellerCo\u201d) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. ( OCGH\u201d), and Oslo Holdings Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oaktree ( Seller MergerCo\u201d) entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective on September 30, 2019, (i) Merger Sub merged with and into Oaktree (the Merger\u201d), with Oaktree continuing as the surviving entity, and (ii) immediately following the Merger, SellerCo merged with and into Seller MergerCo (the Subsequent Merger\u201d and together with the Merger, the Mergers\u201d), with Seller MergerCo continuing as the surviving entity.\nUpon the completion of the Mergers on September 30, 2019, Brookfield acquired 61.2% of Oaktree's business in a stock and cash transaction. The remaining 38.8% of the business at that time continued to be owned by OCGH, whose unitholders consist primarily of Oaktree's founders and certain other members of management and current and former employees. As part of the Merger, Brookfield acquired all outstanding vested OCG Class A units for, at the election of OCG Class A unitholders, either $49.00 in cash or 1.0770 Class A shares of Brookfield per OCG Class A unit (subject to pro-ration to ensure that no more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate merger consideration is paid in the form of cash or stock), in each case, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. In addition, as part of the Subsequent Merger the founders, senior management, and current and former employee-unitholders of OCGH sold 20% of their OCGH units to Brookfield for the same consideration as the OCG Class A unitholders received in the merger.\nRestructuring Transaction\nOn the closing date of the Mergers, we and certain other entities entered into a Restructuring Agreement (the Restructuring\u201d) pursuant to which our direct and indirect ownership of general partner and limited partner interests in certain Oaktree Operating Group entities were transferred to newly-formed, indirect subsidiaries of Brookfield as of October 1, 2019. As a result, on October 1, 2019, four of the six Oaktree Operating Group entities were no longer our indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements will reflect our indirect economic interest in only two of the Oaktree Operating Group entities: (i) Oaktree Capital I, L.P. ( Oaktree Capital I\u201d), which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which holds a majority of Oaktree's investments in its funds and (ii) Oaktree Capital Management (Cayman), L.P. ( OCM Cayman\u201d), which represents Oaktree's non-U.S. fee business. As of October 1, 2019, our consolidated financial statements will no longer reflect any economic interests in the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities: (i) Oaktree Capital II, L.P. ( Oaktree Capital II\u201d), which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which includes Oaktree's investments in certain funds and other businesses, including Oaktree's investment in DoubleLine Capital, L.P., (ii) Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ( OCM\u201d), an entity that serves as the U.S. registered investment adviser to most of the Oaktree funds, (iii) Oaktree Investment Holdings, L.P. ( Oaktree Investment Holdings\u201d), which holds certain corporate investments in other entities and (iv) Oaktree AIF Investments, L.P. ( Oaktree AIF\u201d), which primarily holds interests in certain Oaktree fund investments for regulatory and structuring purposes. As a consequence, the assets of Oaktree Capital II, OCM, Oaktree Investment Holdings and Oaktree AIF will no longer support our operations. Please see Business-Organizational Structure\u201d in this annual report for a diagram of our organizational structure after the Restructuring.\nPrior to the Restructuring on October 1, 2019, our consolidated operating results included substantially all of the revenues and expenses of the Oaktree Operating Group and related consolidated funds and investment vehicles. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our consolidated operating results reflect only Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and related consolidated funds and investment vehicles. Since the deconsolidation of the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities was not required to be presented on a retrospective basis, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflect a full year of activities for Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and related funds and investment vehicles and only nine months of activities for the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities and related funds and investment vehicles and, as a result, are not directly comparable to prior periods. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 only reflect activities for Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and related funds and investment vehicles and do not include any activity for the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities and related funds and investment vehicles and, as a result, are not directly comparable to prior periods.\nAs a result of the Restructuring of our business, references to Oaktree\u201d in this annual report will generally refer to the collective business of the Oaktree Operating Group, of which we are a component.\nUnderstanding Our Results-Consolidation of Oaktree Funds\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires us to consolidate entities in which we have a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. A limited partnership or similar entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) if the unaffiliated limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. Most of the Oaktree funds are VIEs because they have not granted unaffiliated limited partners substantive kick-out or participating rights. The Company consolidates those VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. For entities that are not VIEs, consolidation is evaluated through a majority voting interest model. Please see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information.\nWe do not consolidate most of the Oaktree funds that are VIEs because we are not the primary beneficiary due to the fact that our fee arrangements are considered at-market and thus not deemed to be variable interests, and we do not hold any other interests in those funds that are considered to be more than insignificant. However, investment vehicles in which we have a significant investment, such as CLOs and certain Oaktree funds, are consolidated ( consolidated funds\u201d). When a CLO or fund is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the consolidated funds on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those consolidated funds, which are held by third-party investors, are reflected as debt obligations of CLOs or non-controlling interests in consolidated funds in the consolidated financial statements. All of the revenues earned by us as investment manager of the consolidated funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from and funded by third-party investors, the consolidation of a fund does not impact net income or loss attributable to us.\nCertain entities in which we have the ability to exert significant influence, including unconsolidated Oaktree funds for which we act as general partner, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the Restructuring, we re-assessed our prior variable interest entity consolidation determinations, noting that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of three funds in which our direct ownership interests are held by Oaktree Operating Group entities that are no longer directly controlled by us.\nRevenues\nOur business generates three types of revenue: management fees, incentive income and investment income. Management fees earned from third parties are billed monthly or quarterly based on annual rates and are typically earned for each of the funds that we manage. The contractual terms of management fees generally vary by fund structure. Management fees also may include performance-based fees earned from certain open-end and evergreen fund accounts. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our management fees consist primarily of fees earned from funds managed by OCM Cayman and sub-advisory fees for services provided to OCM. We also have the potential to earn incentive income from most of the closed-end and certain evergreen funds managed by Oaktree in our capacity as the general partner of those funds. These closed-end funds generally provide that we receive incentive income only after we have returned to our investors all of their contributed capital plus an annual preferred return, typically 8%. Once this occurs, we generally receive as incentive income 80% of all distributions otherwise attributable to our investors, and those investors receive the remaining 20% until we have received, as incentive income, 20% of all such distributions in excess of the contributed capital from the inception of the fund. Thereafter, all such future distributions attributable to our investors are distributed 80% to those investors and 20% to us as incentive income. Our third revenue source, investment income, represents our pro-rata share of income or loss from our investments, generally in our capacity as general partner in Oaktree funds and as an investor in our CLOs and third-party managed funds and companies.\nWe may earn incentive income upon deconsolidation of a SPAC arising from the completion of a merger with an identified target. Upon deconsolidation, we will derecognize the net assets of the entity and record any gain or loss related to the remeasurement of its investments to fair value as incentive income in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent fair value changes in our investments held in the entity will be recorded in investment income in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nOur consolidated revenues reflect the elimination of all management fees, incentive income and investment income earned related to consolidated Oaktree funds. Investment income is presented within the other income (loss) section of our consolidated statements of operations. Please see Business-Structure and Operation of Our Business-Structure of Funds\u201d in this annual report for a detailed discussion of the structure of Oaktree funds.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits expense reflects all compensation-related items not directly related to incentive income, investment income or the vesting of Class A units, OCGH units, OCGH equity value units ( EVUs\u201d), deferred equity units and other performance-based units, and includes salaries, bonuses, compensation based on management fees or a definition of profits, employee benefits, payroll taxes and phantom equity awards. Phantom equity awards represent liability-classified awards subject to vesting and remeasurement at the end of each reporting period. Phantom equity award expense reflects the vesting of those liability-classified awards, the equity distribution declared in the period and changes in the Class A unit trading price. Compensation and benefits expense reflects the gross-up of reimbursable costs incurred on behalf of Oaktree funds in which the Company has determined it is the principal. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our consolidated operating results primarily include compensation and benefits expense related to employees of OCM Cayman.\nEquity-based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation expense reflects the non-cash charge associated with grants of Class A units, OCGH units, EVUs, deferred equity units and other performance-based units. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our consolidated operating results primarily include equity-based compensation expense related to employees of OCM Cayman.\nIncentive Income Compensation\nIncentive income compensation expense primarily reflects compensation directly related to incentive income, which generally consists of percentage interests (sometimes referred to as points\u201d or an allocation of shares received upon the completion of a successful SPAC merger) that are granted to Oaktree investment professionals associated with the particular fund or SPAC that generated the incentive income, and secondarily, compensation directly related to investment income. There is no fixed percentage for the incentive income-related portion of this compensation, either by fund, SPAC or strategy. In general, within a particular strategy more recent funds have a higher percentage of aggregate incentive income compensation expense than do older funds. The percentage that consolidated incentive income compensation expense represents of the particular period's consolidated incentive income may not be meaningful because incentive income from consolidated funds or SPACs is eliminated in consolidation, whereas no incentive income compensation expense is eliminated in consolidation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense includes costs related to occupancy, outside auditors, tax professionals, legal advisers, research, consultants, travel and entertainment, communications and information services, business process outsourcing, foreign-exchange activity, insurance, placement costs, changes in the contingent consideration liability, and other general items related directly to the Company's operations. These expenses are net of amounts borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' non-controlling interests in consolidated funds. General and administrative expense reflects the gross-up of reimbursable costs incurred on behalf of Oaktree funds in which the Company has determined it is the principal. Subsequent to the Restructuring, general and administrative expenses primarily include direct and reimbursable expenses incurred by Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and the Company's share of certain expenses through a service agreement with OCM.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes costs associated with the purchase of furniture and equipment, capitalized software, office leasehold improvements and acquired intangibles. Furniture and equipment and capitalized software costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the respective estimated useful life or the lease term. Acquired intangibles primarily relate to contractual rights and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to 25 years. Subsequent to the Restructuring, the majority of Oaktree's acquired intangible assets are no longer included in our consolidated statement of financial condition.\nConsolidated Fund Expenses\nConsolidated fund expenses consist primarily of costs, expenses and fees that are incurred by, or arise out of the operation and activities of or otherwise are related to, our consolidated funds, including, without limitation, travel expenses, professional fees, research and software expenses, insurance, and other costs associated with administering and supporting those funds. Inasmuch as most of these fund expenses are borne by third-party investors, they reduce the investors' interests in the consolidated funds and have no impact on net income or loss attributable to the Company.\nOther Income (Loss)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily reflects the interest expense of the consolidated funds, as well as the interest expense of Oaktree and its operating subsidiaries. Prior to the Restructuring, our financial statements reflected debt service of the entire Oaktree Operating Group. After the Restructuring since OCM has historically been the only direct borrower or issuer under credit agreements and private placement notes with third parties and made all payments of principal and interest, our financial statements generally will not reflect debt obligations, interest expense or related liabilities associated with our operating subsidiaries, until such time as Oaktree Capital I, one of our two remaining Oaktree Operating Group entities, directly borrows or issues notes under such arrangements.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income consists of interest and dividend income earned on the investments held by our consolidated funds, and interest income earned by Oaktree and its operating subsidiaries.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Consolidated Funds' Investments\nNet realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds' investments consists of realized gains and losses arising from dispositions of investments held by our consolidated funds.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds' Investments\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds' investments reflects both unrealized gains and losses on investments held by our consolidated funds and the reversal upon disposition of investments of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for those investments.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income represents our pro-rata share of income or loss from our investments, generally in our capacity as general partner in certain Oaktree funds and as an investor in our CLOs and third-party managed funds and companies. Investment income, as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations, excludes investment income earned by us from our consolidated funds.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net represents non-operating income or expense.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is a publicly traded partnership. Because it satisfies the qualifying income test, it is not required to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes; rather it is taxed as a partnership. The Company currently holds interests in Oaktree Capital I, L.P. (a non-corporate entity that is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax) and Oaktree Capital Management (Cayman), L.P. (which holds subsidiaries that are taxable in non-U.S. jurisdictions).\nPrior to the Restructuring on October 1, 2019, Oaktree Holdings, Inc. and Oaktree AIF Holdings, Inc., which were two of the Company's Intermediate Holding Companies and wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries, were subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. The remainder of the Company's income was generally not subject to U.S. corporate-level taxation.\nUpon the Restructuring, Oaktree Holdings, Inc. and Oaktree AIF Holdings, Inc. merged with and into newly formed, indirect subsidiaries of Brookfield, with those subsidiaries surviving the mergers. As a result, as of October 1, 2019, Oaktree Holdings, Inc. and Oaktree AIF Holdings, Inc. ceased to exist and the Company no longer includes\non our financial statements economic interests in Oaktree Capital II, Oaktree Investment Holdings, OCM, and Oaktree AIF. All deferred tax balances related to these entities were deconsolidated as part of the Restructuring effective October 1, 2019.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets would be reduced by a valuation allowance if it becomes more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company analyzes its tax filing positions for all open tax years in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns. If the Company determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a reserve is established. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. The Company reviews its tax positions quarterly and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available.\nThe Oaktree funds are generally not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and, consequently, no income tax provision has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because individual partners are responsible for their proportionate share of the taxable income.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in our financial statements. These interests fall into two categories:\n\u2022Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. This category represents the economic interests of the unaffiliated investors in the consolidated funds, as well as the equity interests held by third-party investors in CLOs that had not yet priced as of the respective period end. Those interests are primarily driven by the investment performance of the consolidated funds. In comparison to net income, this measure excludes our operating results and other items solely attributable to the Company; and,\n\u2022Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. This category primarily represents the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH ( OCGH non-controlling interest\u201d), as well as the economic interest in certain consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties. Prior to the Restructuring, this category included the OCGH non-controlling interest in all six Oaktree Operating Group entities; subsequent to the Restructuring, it includes only the OCGH non-controlling interest in Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman. The OCGH non-controlling interest is determined at the Oaktree Operating Group level based on the weighted average proportionate share of Oaktree Operating Group units held by the OCGH unitholders. Inasmuch as the number of outstanding Oaktree Operating Group units corresponds with the total number of outstanding Class A and OCGH units, changes in the economic interest held by the OCGH unitholders are driven by our additional issuances of Class A and OCGH units, as well as repurchases and forfeitures of, and exchanges between, Class A and OCGH units. Certain of our expenses, such as income tax and related administrative expenses of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC and its Intermediate Holding Companies, are solely attributable to the Class A unitholders. Please see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH.\nNet Income Attributable to Preferred Unitholders\nThis category represents distributions declared, if any, on our preferred units. Please see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that we believe provide important information and data regarding our business. As a result of the Restructuring, a substantial portion of our revenues will be comprised of incentive income and investment income earned in our capacity as general partner of certain Oaktree funds. To analyze and monitor our operating performance we utilize incentive-creating AUM, incentives created (fund level) and accrued incentives (fund level). These operating metrics provide us with detailed information and insight into the operating performance of the funds we manage.\nIncentive-creating Assets Under Management.\nIncentive-creating AUM refers to the AUM that may eventually produce incentive income. It generally represents the NAV of Oaktree funds for which we are entitled to receive an incentive allocation, excluding CLOs and investments made by us and our or Oaktree employees and directors (which are not subject to an incentive allocation) and gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), net of cash, for our BDCs. All funds for which we are entitled to receive an incentive allocation are included in incentive-creating AUM, regardless of whether or not they are currently above their preferred return or high-water mark and therefore generating incentives. Incentive-creating AUM does not include undrawn capital commitments.\nAccrued Incentives (Fund Level) and Incentives Created (Fund Level)\nOaktree funds record as accrued incentives the incentive income that would be paid to us if the funds were liquidated at their reported values as of the date of the financial statements. Incentives created (fund level) refers to the gross amount of potential incentives generated by these funds during the period. We refer to the amount of accrued incentives recognized as revenue by us as incentive income. Amounts recognized by us as incentive income are no longer included in accrued incentives (fund level), the term we use for remaining fund-level accruals. The amount of incentives created may fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in the fair value of the underlying investments of the fund, as well as incentives created in excess of our typical 20% share due to catch-up allocations for applicable closed-end funds. In general, while in the catch-up layer, approximately 80% of any increase or decrease, respectively, in the fund's NAV results in a commensurate amount of positive or negative incentives created (fund level).\nThe same performance and market risks inherent in incentives created (fund level) affect the ability to ultimately realize accrued incentives (fund level). One consequence of the accounting method we follow for incentives created (fund level) is that accrued incentives (fund level) is an off-balance sheet metric, rather than being an on-balance sheet receivable that could require reduction if fund performance suffers. We track accrued incentives (fund level) because it provides an indication of potential future value, though the timing and ultimate realization of that value are uncertain.\nIncentives created (fund level), incentive income and accrued incentives (fund level) are presented gross, without deduction for direct compensation expense that is owed to Oaktree investment professionals associated with the particular fund when we earn the incentive income. We call that charge incentive income compensation expense.\u201d Incentive income compensation expense varies by the investment strategy and vintage of the particular fund, among many other factors.\nIncentives created (fund level) often reflects investments measured at fair value and therefore is subject to risk of substantial fluctuation by the time the underlying investments are liquidated. We earn the incentive income, if any, that the fund is then obligated to pay us with respect to our incentive interest (generally 20%) in the profits of our unaffiliated investors, subject to an annual preferred return of typically 8%. Incentive income is recognized when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We track incentives created (fund level) because it provides an indication of the value for us currently being created by investment activities of the funds and facilitates comparability with those companies in our industry that account for investments in carry funds as equity-method investments, thus effectively reflecting an accrual-based method for recognizing incentive income in their financial statements.\nGAAP Consolidated Results of Operations (1)\nThe following table sets forth our audited consolidated statements of operations:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

are no longer our indirect subsidiaries. The deconsolidation of the four Oaktree Operating Group entities that are no longer our indirect subsidiaries is presented on a prospective basis and did not require that prior periods be recast. Accordingly, effective October 1, 2019, our consolidated financial statements reflect our indirect economic interest in only two of the Oaktree Operating Group entities: (i) Oaktree Capital I, which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which holds a majority of Oaktree's investments in its funds and (ii) OCM Cayman, which represents Oaktree's non-U.S. fee business.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nRevenues\nManagement Fees\nManagement fees increased $49.1 million, or 26.4%, to $234.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $185.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to sub-advisory fees earned, reflecting both growth of Oaktree's business operations and its impact to the sub-advisory fees we earn from these arrangements.\nIncentive Income\nA summary of incentive income is set forth below:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive Income: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oaktree funds:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>208,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,945 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private Equity </td> <td>728,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173,662 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Assets </td> <td>188,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,625 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Listed Equities </td> <td>94,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,105 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total incentive income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,219,624 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncentive income increased $976.3 million, or 401.3%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $243.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in incentive income was primarily due to higher distributions from Private Equity and Real Assets closed-end funds that were paying incentive income. The year ended December 31, 2021 included $643.2 million from Oaktree Power Opportunities Fund IV, up from $133.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $160.4 million from Highstar Continuation Fund, which did not generate any incentive income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits expense increased $30.7 million, or 23.3%, to $162.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $131.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to headcount growth and Long-Term Incentive Plan awards.\nEquity-based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation expense decreased $6.9 million, or 39.7%, to $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting that beginning in 2020, deferred compensation is primarily paid in Long-Term Incentive Plan awards rather than equity-based awards.\nIncentive Income Compensation\nIncentive income compensation expense increased $489.8 million, or 468.7%, to $594.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $104.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the increase in incentive income.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $1.4 million, or 6.1%, to $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by foreign exchange.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $0.2 million, or 9.5%, to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nConsolidated Fund Expenses\nConsolidated fund expenses increased $42.1 million, or 126.8%, to $75.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase primarily reflects the impact of fund operating expenses and interest expense incurred primarily by Opps XI.\nOther Income (Loss)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $2.4 million, or 1.5%, to $155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $157.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates, partially offset by increased debt outstanding.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income increased $71.1 million, or 22.3%, to $389.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $318.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to our consolidated funds.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Consolidated Funds' Investments\nNet realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds' investments increased $128.2 million, to a net gain of $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from a net loss of $106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in our net realized gain (loss) primarily reflects our consolidated funds' performance on investments sold, primarily resulting from our CLOs and Opps XI, and the deconsolidation of an open-end credit fund that recognized net realized losses during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds' Investments\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds' investments increased $306.3 million, to net appreciation of $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from net depreciation of $183.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the impact of the reversal of net realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds' investments, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds' investments increased $434.6 million to a net gain of $144.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from a net loss of $289.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase reflected our consolidated funds' performance in each period, primarily resulting from Opps XI and the deconsolidation of an open-end credit fund that recognized net unrealized depreciation during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInvestment Income\nA summary of investment income is set forth below: Table 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from investments in funds: </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oaktree funds:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>248,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,574 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private Equity </td> <td>93,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,139 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Assets </td> <td>(15,687) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,552) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Listed Equities </td> <td>9,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Oaktree </td> <td>(22,334) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,953) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income - Oaktree and operating subsidiaries </td> <td>312,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations </td> <td>(109,794) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,517 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>203,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment income increased $99.2 million, or 95.5%, to $203.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase primarily reflected higher returns on our Credit investments.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes increased $4.2 million, or 51.2%, to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting higher taxable net income attributable to our operations outside of the United States during the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rates applicable to Class A unitholders for 2021 and 2020 were 1% and 4%, respectively. We generally expect variability in tax rates between periods, because the effective tax rate is a function of the mix of income and other factors, each of which can have a material impact on the particular period's income tax expense and may vary significantly within or between years. Please see the Income Taxes section of -Understanding Our Results-Consolidation of Oaktree Funds.\u201d\nNet (Income) Loss Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds\nNet (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated funds increased $351.9 million, to net income of $186.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from net loss of $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase reflected our consolidated funds' performance attributable to third-party investors in each period. These effects are described in more detail under -Other Income (Loss)\u201d above.\nNet Income Attributable to Oaktree Capital Group, LLC Class A Unitholders\nNet income attributable to OCG Class A unitholders increased $465.9 million, or 336.6%, to $604.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $138.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting our allocated portion of the incentive income and our consolidated funds' performance in each period.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that we believe provide important data regarding our business. These operating metrics include incentive-creating AUM, incentives created (fund level) and accrued incentives (fund level). As a result of the Restructuring, effective October 1, 2019, our Operating Metrics include only the portion associated with the two Oaktree Operating Group entities that remain our indirect subsidiaries.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of or for the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands except as otherwise indicated) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Metrics: (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets under management (in millions): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive-creating assets under management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,330 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued incentives (fund level): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentives created (fund level) </td> <td>1,467,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269,421 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentives created (fund level), net of associated incentive income compensation expense\n</td> <td>558,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>309,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132,959 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued incentives (fund level) </td> <td>1,668,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,314,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>938,806 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued incentives (fund level), net of associated incentive income compensation expense\n</td> <td>800,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>610,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>439,128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Our funds record as accrued incentives the incentive income that would be paid to us if the funds were liquidated at their reported values as of the date of the financial statements. Incentives created (fund level) refers to the gross amount of potential incentives generated by the funds during the period. We refer to the amount of incentive income recognized as revenue by us as incentive income. Amounts recognized by us as incentive income are no longer included in accrued incentives (fund level), the term we use for remaining fund-level accruals. Incentives created (fund level), incentive income and accrued incentives (fund level) are presented gross, without deduction for direct compensation expense that is owed to our investment professionals associated with the particular fund when we earn the incentive income.

Accordingly, effective October 1, 2019, our consolidated financial statements reflect our indirect economic interest in only two of the Oaktree Operating Group entities: (i) Oaktree Capital I, which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which holds a majority of Oaktree's investments in its funds and (ii) OCM Cayman, which represents Oaktree's non-U.S. fee business. Additionally, effective October 1, 2019, our Operating Metrics include only the portion associated with the remaining two Oaktree Operating Group entities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the portion of net accrued incentives (fund level) represented by funds that were currently paying incentives was $30.0 million (or 3.7%), $152.3 million (25.0%) and $80.6 million (18.4%), respectively, with the remainder arising from funds that as of that date were not at the stage of their cash distribution waterfall where Oaktree was entitled to receive incentives, other than possibly tax-related distributions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $365 million, or 45.6%, of the net accrued incentives (fund level) were in evergreen or closed-end funds in their liquidation period. Please see -Critical Accounting Policies-Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d for a discussion of the fair-value hierarchy level established by GAAP.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nIncentives created (fund level) was $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting $857.2 million of incentives created (fund level) from Credit funds, $588.0 million from Private Equity funds, and $191.0 million from Real Asset funds.\nGAAP Statement of Financial Condition\nWe manage our financial condition without the consolidation of the Oaktree funds in which we serve as general partner. Since Oaktree's founding, Oaktree and, by extension, we have managed our financial condition in a way that builds our capital base and maintains sufficient liquidity for known and anticipated uses of cash. Our assets do not include accrued incentives (fund level), an off-balance sheet metric.\nThe following table presents our GAAP consolidating statement of financial condition:\nTable 27:

Resources\nWe manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of Oaktree funds and the effect of normal changes in short-term assets and liabilities. Our primary cash flow activities on an unconsolidated basis involve (a) generating cash flow from operations, (b) generating income from investment activities, including strategic investments in certain third parties, (c) funding capital commitments that we have made to Oaktree funds in which we act as general partner, (d) funding our growth initiatives, (e) distributing cash flow to our Class A and OCGH unitholders, (f) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes and other borrowing arrangements, and (g) issuances of, and distributions made on, our preferred units. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $169.4 million of cash and U.S. Treasury and other securities and no outstanding debt. See the Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity section for additional details of Oaktree and its indirect subsidiaries financing activities in 2021.\nOngoing sources of cash include (a) management and sub-advisory fees, which are collected monthly or quarterly, (b) incentive income, which is volatile and largely unpredictable as to amount and timing, and (c) distributions stemming from our corporate investments in funds and companies. We primarily use cash flow from operations and distributions from our corporate investments to pay compensation and related expenses, general and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions. This same cash flow, together with proceeds from equity and debt issuances, is also used to fund corporate investments, fixed assets and other capital items. Subject to applicable law and certain consent rights contained in our operating agreement, pursuant to a covenant in our operating agreement we plan to cause the Oaktree Operating Group, including our indirect subsidiaries Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman, to distribute, on a quarterly basis, at least 85% of its adjusted distributable earnings, as defined in our operating agreement, and we plan to distribute amounts we receive in respect of such distributions, less any tax and tax receivable obligations, to holders of our Class A units. Distributions from each Operating Group entity may not be proportionate to its share of adjusted distributable earnings.\nDistributions on the preferred units are discretionary and non-cumulative. We may redeem, at our option, out of funds legally available, the preferred units, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 15, 2023 in respect of the Series A preferred units or September 15, 2023 in respect of the Series B preferred units, at a price of $25.00 per preferred unit plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date, without payment of any undeclared distributions. Holders of the preferred units have no right to require the redemption of such preferred units.\nOn August 3, 2020, we subscribed for a limited partner interest in, and made a capital commitment of, $750 million to Oaktree Opportunities Fund XI, L.P., a parallel investment vehicle thereof or a feeder fund in respect of one of the foregoing (such limited partner interest, the Opps XI Investment\u201d and such fund entities collectively, Opps XI\u201d). In order to fund the Opps XI Investment, our sole Class A unitholder, or one of its affiliates, will contribute cash as a capital contribution (the Opps XI Investment Cash\u201d) as and to the extent required to satisfy our obligations to Opps XI. We will use the Opps XI Investment Cash solely to fund the Opps XI Investment and satisfy our obligations in respect of Opps XI. Distributions from the Opps XI Investment are intended for the benefit of the Class A unitholder, subject to applicable law. Our preferred unitholders should not rely on distributions received by\nus in respect of the Opps XI Investment for payment of dividends or redemption of the preferred units. As of December 31, 2021, $225 million of the $750 million capital commitment was funded.\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nThe accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include our consolidated funds, despite the fact that we typically have only a minority economic interest in those funds. The assets of consolidated funds, on a gross basis, are larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds involve:\n\u2022raising capital from third-party investors;\n\u2022using the capital provided by us and third-party investors to fund investments and operating expenses;\n\u2022financing certain investments with indebtedness;\n\u2022generating cash flows through the realization of investments, as well as the collection of interest and dividend income; and\n\u2022distributing net cash flows to fund investors and to us.\nBecause our consolidated funds are either treated as investment companies for accounting purposes or represent CLOs whose primary operations are investing activities, their investing cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations. We believe that we and each of the consolidated funds has sufficient access to cash to fund our and their respective operations in the near term.\nSignificant amounts from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are discussed below.\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities used $2.7 billion, $1.1 billion and $3.1 billion of cash in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts principally reflected net income, purchases of securities, net of non-cash adjustments, in each of the respective periods and net purchases of securities of the consolidated funds.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities provided $184.8 million of cash in 2021, $47.9 million of cash in 2020, and $751.4 million of cash in 2019. Net activity from purchases, maturities and sales of U.S. Treasury and other securities included net proceeds of $7.6 million in 2021, net purchases of $0.1 million in 2020, and net proceeds of $527.3 million in 2019. Corporate investments in funds and companies of $180.0 million, $225.6 million and $264.7 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, consisted of the following:\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>760.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>592.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminated in consolidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(580.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(366.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(735.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>225.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>264.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDistributions and proceeds from corporate investments in funds and companies of $357.7 million, $274.3 million and $495.5 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, consisted of the following:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>468.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>498.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>897.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminated in consolidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(110.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(224.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(401.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>357.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>274.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>495.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchases of fixed assets were $0.6 million, $0.7 million and $6.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $2.7 billion of cash in 2021, $1.5 billion of cash in 2020 and $2.7 billion of cash in 2019. Financing activities included: (a) net contributions from non-controlling interests in consolidated funds of $1.0 billion, $716.5 million and $557.2 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively; (b) net borrowings on credit facilities of the consolidated funds of $761.0 million, $397.8 million and $159.4 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively; (c) distributions to unitholders of $779.6 million, $140.8 million and $827.1 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively; (d) net capital contributions of $183.7 million and $55.8 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and net unit purchases of $12.2 million in 2019; (e) payments of debt issuance costs of $2.6 million, $2.8 million and $4.2 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively; (f) proceeds from debt obligations issued by our CLOs of $5.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $4.8 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively; and (g) repayments of $3.8 billion, $599.1 million, and $1.9 billion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, related to CLO debt obligations that were refinanced.\nFuture Sources and Uses of Liquidity\nWe expect to continue to make distributions to our preferred unitholders in accordance with their contractual terms and our Class A unitholders pursuant to our distribution policy for our common units as described in our operating agreement. In the future, subject to our operating agreement we may also issue additional units or debt and other equity securities with the objective of increasing our available capital. In addition, we may, from time to time, repurchase our preferred units in open market or privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, redeem our preferred units pursuant to the terms of their respective governing documents, or repurchase OCGH units.\nIn addition to our ongoing sources of cash that include management and sub-advisory fees, incentive income and distributions related to our corporate investments in funds and companies, we also have access to liquidity through our debt financings, credit agreements and equity financings. Prior to the Restructuring, our financial statements reflected debt and debt service of the entire Oaktree Operating Group, however, OCM has historically been the only direct borrower or issuer under credit agreements and private placement notes with third parties and made all payments of principal and interest. While certain Oaktree Operating Group entities (including Oaktree Capital I) are co-obligors and jointly and severally liable, debt obligations are reflected in the consolidated financial statements based upon the entity that actually made the borrowing and received the related proceeds. Accordingly, our financial statements after the Restructuring generally will not reflect debt obligations, interest expense or related liabilities associated with our operating subsidiaries, until such time as Oaktree Capital I, one of our two remaining Oaktree Operating Group entities, directly borrows or issues notes under such arrangements.\nWe believe that the sources of liquidity described below will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nDebt Financings\nIn January 2022, our former indirect subsidiary, OCM, issued and sold to certain accredited investors $200 million of 3.06% senior notes due 2037 (the 2037 Notes\u201d). The 2037 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the issuer, jointly and severally guaranteed by our indirect subsidiary, Oaktree Capital I and our former indirect subsidiaries, Oaktree Capital II and Oaktree AIF. The 2037 Notes provide for certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants relating to the issuer's and guarantors' combined leverage ratio and minimum assets under management. In addition, the 2037 Notes contain customary representations and warranties of the issuer and the guarantors, and customary events of default, in certain cases, subject to cure periods. The issuer may prepay all, or from time to time any part of, the 2037 Notes at any time, subject in the case of optional prepayment prior to the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the notes, to the issuer's payment of the applicable make-whole amount determined with respect to such principal amount prepaid. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the issuer will be required to make an offer to prepay the 2037 Notes without any make-whole amount. As OCM is the issuer of such senior unsecured notes, the outstanding principal and interest payments guaranteed by Oaktree Capital I will not be included in our financial statements unless an event of default occurs.\nIn July 2020, our former indirect subsidiary, OCM issued and sold to certain accredited investors $200 million aggregate principal amount of 3.64% Senior Notes, Series A, due 2030 (the Series A 2030 Notes\u201d) and $50 million aggregate principal amount of 3.84% Senior Notes, Series B, due 2035 (the Series B 2035 Notes\u201d) pursuant to a note and guaranty agreement Both series of notes are senior unsecured obligations of the issuer, jointly and severally guaranteed by our indirect subsidiary, Oaktree Capital I and our former indirect subsidiaries, Oaktree Capital II and Oaktree AIF. Both series of notes provide for certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants relating to the issuer's and guarantors' combined leverage ratio and minimum assets under\nmanagement. In addition, the Series A 2030 Notes and Series B 2035 Notes contain customary representations and warranties of the issuer and the guarantors, and customary events of default, in certain cases, subject to cure periods. The issuer may prepay all, or from time to time any part of, the Series A 2030 Notes and Series B 2035 Notes at any time, subject in the case of optional prepayment prior to the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the notes, to the issuer's payment of the applicable make-whole amount determined with respect to such principal amount prepaid. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the issuer will be required to make an offer to prepay both series of notes without any make-whole amount. As OCM is the issuer of such senior unsecured notes, the outstanding principal and interest payments guaranteed by Oaktree Capital I will not be included in our financial statements unless an event of default occurs.\nIn May 2020, Oaktree Capital I, along with certain other Oaktree Operating Group members as co-borrowers, entered into a credit agreement with a subsidiary of Brookfield that provides for a subordinated credit facility maturing on May 19, 2023. The subordinated credit facility has a revolving loan commitment of $250 million and borrowings generally bear interest at a spread to either LIBOR or an alternative base rate. Borrowings on the subordinated credit facility are subordinate to the outstanding debt obligations and borrowings on the primary credit facility of Oaktree Capital I and its co-borrowers as detailed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Oaktree Capital I is jointly and severally liable, along with its co-obligors for outstanding borrowings on the subordinated credit facility. As set forth in such note 10, the Company's financial statements generally will not reflect debt obligations, interest expense or related liabilities associated with its operating subsidiaries until such time as Oaktree Capital I directly borrows from the subordinated credit facility. No amounts were outstanding on the subordinated credit facility as of December 31, 2021.\nIn December 2019, our former indirect subsidiaries OCM, Oaktree Capital II, Oaktree AIF, and our indirect subsidiary Oaktree Capital I (collectively, the Borrowers\u201d) entered into the Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Fifth Amendment\u201d), which amended the credit agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (as amended through and including the Fifth Amendment, the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Fifth Amendment extended the maturity date of the Credit Agreement from March 29, 2023 to December 13, 2024, increased the revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d) from $500 million to $650 million, provided for the refinancing of the then-outstanding $150 million term loan balance with revolving loans, and provides the Borrowers with the option to extend the new maturity date by one year up to two times if the lenders holding at least 50% of the aggregate amount of the revolving loan commitment thereunder on the date of the Borrowers' extension request consent to such extension. The Fifth Amendment also favorably updated the commitment fee and interest rate margins in the corporate ratings-based pricing grid, increased the AUM covenant threshold from $60 billion to $65 billion and made certain other amendments to the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a spread to either LIBOR or an alternative base rate. Based on the current credit ratings of OCM, the interest rate on borrowings is LIBOR plus 0.88% per annum and the commitment fee on the unused portions of the Revolver is 0.08% per annum. The Credit Agreement contains customary financial covenants and restrictions, including (after giving effect to the Fifth Amendment) covenants regarding a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50x-to-1.00x and a minimum required level of assets under management (as defined in the credit agreement). In September 2021, the Borrowers entered into the Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Sixth Agreement\u201d). The Sixth Amendment extended the maturity date of the Credit Agreement from December 13, 2024 to September 14, 2026, modified the AUM covenant threshold from $65 billion of AUM to $57.5 billion of management fee-generating AUM, and increased the maximum leverage ratio to 4.00x-to-1.00x. As set forth in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report, the Company's financial statements generally will not reflect debt obligations, interest expense or related liabilities associated with its operating subsidiaries until such time as Oaktree Capital I directly borrows from the subordinated credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, OCM had $55 million outstanding borrowings under the $650 million revolving credit facility.\nIn December 2017, our former indirect subsidiary, OCM, issued and sold to certain accredited investors $250 million of 3.78% senior notes due 2032 (the 2032 Notes\u201d). The 2032 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the issuer, jointly and severally guaranteed by our indirect subsidiary, Oaktree Capital I and our former indirect subsidiaries, Oaktree Capital II and Oaktree AIF. The proceeds from the sale of the 2032 Notes and cash on hand were used to redeem the $250 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 and to pay the related make-whole premium to holders thereof. In connection with the Notes offering, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to euros, reducing the interest cost to 1.95% per year. The 2032 Notes provide for certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants relating to the issuer's and guarantors' combined leverage ratio and minimum assets under management. In addition, the 2032 Notes contain customary representations and warranties of the issuer and the guarantors, and customary events of default, in certain cases, subject to cure periods. The issuer may prepay all, or from time to time any part of, the 2032 Notes at any time, subject to the\nissuer's payment of the applicable make-whole amount determined with respect to such principal amount prepaid. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the issuer will be required to make an offer to prepay the 2032 Notes together with the applicable make-whole amount determined with respect to such principal amount prepaid. As OCM is the issuer of such senior unsecured notes, the outstanding principal and interest payments guaranteed by Oaktree Capital I will not be included in our financial statements unless an event of default occurs.\nIn July 2016, our former indirect subsidiary, OCM, issued and sold to certain accredited investors $100 million of 3.69% senior notes due July 12, 2031 (the 2031 Notes\u201d). The 2031 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the issuer, jointly and severally guaranteed by our indirect subsidiary Oaktree Capital I, and our former indirect subsidiaries, Oaktree Capital II and Oaktree AIF pursuant to a note and guaranty agreement. The proceeds from the sale of the 2031 Notes were used to simultaneously repay $100 million of borrowings outstanding under the $250 million term loan due March 31, 2021. The 2031 Notes provide for certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants relating to the issuer's and guarantors' combined leverage ratio and minimum assets under management. In addition, the 2031 Notes contain customary representations and warranties of the issuer and the guarantors, and customary events of default, in certain cases, subject to cure periods. The issuer may prepay all, or from time to time any part of, the 2031 Notes at any time, subject to the issuer's payment of the applicable make-whole amount determined with respect to such principal amount prepaid. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the issuer will be required to make an offer to prepay the 2031 Notes together with the applicable make-whole amount determined with respect to such principal amount prepaid. As OCM is the issuer of such senior unsecured notes, the outstanding principal and interest payments guaranteed by Oaktree Capital I will not be included in our financial statements unless an event of default occurs.\nIn September 2014, our former indirect subsidiary, OCM issued and sold to certain accredited investors $50 million aggregate principal amount of 3.91% Senior Notes, Series A, due September 3, 2024 (the Series A Notes\u201d), $100 million aggregate principal amount of 4.01% Senior Notes, Series B, due September 3, 2026 (the Series B Notes\u201d) and $100 million aggregate principal amount of 4.21% Senior Notes, Series C, due September 3, 2029 (the Series C Notes\u201d and together with the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, the Senior Notes\u201d) pursuant to a note and guarantee agreement. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the issuer, guaranteed on a joint and several basis by our indirect subsidiary Oaktree Capital I, and our former indirect subsidiaries, Oaktree Capital II and Oaktree AIF. Interest on the 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes provide for certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants relating to the issuer's and guarantors' combined leverage ratio and minimum assets under management. In addition, the Senior Notes contain customary representations and warranties of the issuer and the guarantors, and customary events of default, in certain cases, subject to cure periods. The issuer may prepay all, or from time to time any part of, the Senior Notes at any time, subject to the issuer's payment of the applicable make-whole amount determined with respect to such principal amount prepaid. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the issuer will be required to make an offer to prepay the Senior Notes together with the applicable make-whole amount determined with respect to such principal amount prepaid. As OCM is the issuer of such senior unsecured notes, the outstanding principal and interest payments guaranteed by Oaktree Capital I will not be included in our financial statements unless an event of default occurs.\nPreferred Unit Issuances\nOn May 17, 2018, we issued 7,200,000 of our 6.625% Series A preferred units representing limited liability company interests with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit. The issuance resulted in $173.7 million in net proceeds to us. Distributions on the Series A preferred units, when and if declared by the board of directors of Oaktree, will be paid quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. The first distribution was paid on September 17, 2018. Distributions on the Series A preferred units are non-cumulative.\nOn August 9, 2018, we issued 9,400,000 of our 6.550% Series B preferred units representing limited liability company interests with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit. The issuance resulted in $226.9 million in net proceeds to us. Distributions on the Series B preferred units, when and if declared by the board of directors of Oaktree, will be paid quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. The first distribution was paid on December 17, 2018. Distributions on the Series B preferred units are non-cumulative.\nUnless distributions have been declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment on the preferred units for a quarterly distribution period, during the remainder of that distribution period we may not repurchase any common units or any other units that are junior in rank, as to the payment of distributions, to the preferred units and we may not declare or pay or set apart payment for distributions on any common units or junior units for the remainder of that distribution period, other than certain Permitted Distributions (as defined in the unit designation related to the applicable preferred units (each, the Preferred Unit Designation\u201d)).\nWe may redeem, at our option, out of funds legally available, the preferred units, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 15, 2023 in respect of the Series A preferred units or September 15, 2023 in respect of the Series B preferred units, at a price of $25.00 per preferred unit plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date, without payment of any undeclared distributions. Holders of the preferred units have no right to require the redemption of the preferred units.\nIf a Change of Control Event (as defined in the applicable Preferred Unit Designation) occurs prior to June 15, 2023 in respect of the Series A preferred units or September 15, 2023 in respect of the Series B preferred units, we may, at our option, out of funds legally available, redeem the applicable preferred units, in whole but not in part, upon at least 30 days' notice, within 60 days of the occurrence of such Change of Control Event, at a price of $25.25 per preferred unit, plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date, without payment of any undeclared distributions.\nIf a Tax Redemption Event or Rating Agency Event (each, as defined in the applicable Preferred Unit Designation) occurs prior to June 15, 2023 in respect of the Series A preferred units or September 15, 2023 in respect of the Series B preferred units, we may, at our option, out of funds legally available, redeem the applicable preferred units, in whole but not in part, upon at least 30 days' notice, within 60 days of the occurrence of such Tax Redemption Event or Rating Agency Event, at a price of $25.50 per preferred unit, plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date, without payment of any undeclared distributions.\nThe preferred units are not convertible into Class A units or any other class or series of our interests or any other security. Holders of the preferred units do not have any of the voting rights given to holders of our Class A units, except that holders of the preferred units are entitled to certain voting rights under certain conditions.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments.

Capital commitments are expected to be called over a period of several years.\nIn some of our service contracts or management agreements, we have agreed to indemnify third-party service providers or separate account clients under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has neither been included in the above table nor recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Please see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for information on our commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. Our most significant assumptions and estimates are related to the valuation of our corporate investments and the investments of our consolidated funds, and the determination of grant date fair value of our equity-based awards. For a summary of our significant accounting policies and estimates, please see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nPlease see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for information regarding recent accounting developments.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed discussion and analysis of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC's financial condition and results of operations.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. The factors listed under Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this annual report provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in any forward-looking statements.\nBusiness Overview\nOaktree is a leading global alternative investment management firm with expertise in investing in credit, real assets, private equity, and listed equities. Oaktree's mission is to deliver superior investment results with risk under control and to conduct its business with the highest integrity. Oaktree emphasizes an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to its investments. Over more than three decades, Oaktree has developed a large and growing client base through its ability to identify and capitalize on opportunities for attractive investment returns in less efficient markets.\nOaktree was formed in 1995 by a group of individuals who had been investing together since the mid-1980s. Oaktree's founders were pioneers in the management of high yield bonds, convertible securities and distressed debt. From those roots Oaktree has developed a diversified mix of specialized credit- and equity-oriented strategies. Oaktree operates according to a unifying investment philosophy, which consists of six tenets-risk control, consistency, market inefficiency, specialization, bottom-up analysis and disavowal of market timing-and is complemented by a set of core business principles that articulate our commitment to excellence in investing, commonality of interests with clients, a collaborative and cooperative culture, and a disciplined, opportunistic approach to the expansion of products.\nBusiness Environment and Developments\nAs a global investment manager, Oaktree is affected by a wide range of factors, including the condition of the global economy and financial markets; the relative attractiveness of Oaktree's investment strategies and investors' demand for them; and regulatory or other governmental policies or actions. Global economic conditions can significantly impact the values of Oaktree's and its funds' investments and the ability to make new investments or sell existing investments for these funds. Historically, however, Oaktree's diversified nature, of both its investment strategies and revenue mix, has generally allowed it to benefit from both strong and weak economic environments. Weak economies and the declining financial markets that typically accompany them tend to dampen revenues from asset-based management fees, investment realizations or price appreciation, but their prospect can present opportunities to raise relatively larger amounts of capital for certain strategies, especially opportunistic credit. Additionally, weak financial markets may also present more opportunities for funds to make investments at reduced prices. Conversely, strong financial markets generally increase the value of fund investments, which positions Oaktree, and us, for growth in management fees that are based on asset value, and typically create favorable exit opportunities that enhance the prospect for incentive income and fund-related realized investment income proceeds. Those same markets may delay or diminish opportunities to deploy capital and thus management fees from certain funds.\nCOVID-19 continues to pose serious threats to the health and economic wellbeing of the worldwide population and the overall economy in light of COVID-19 variants that seem to spread more easily than the original COVID-19 virus. The number of reported COVID-19 infections are rising again in certain countries worldwide likely due to these variants and the relaxation of certain efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 previously imposed by governmental authorities. While the equity markets have rebounded from their steep declines in March 2020 after the World Health Organization announced that infections of COVID-19 had become a pandemic, there is continued uncertainty as to the duration of the global health and economic impact caused by COVID-19 even with COVID-19 vaccines now available. Actions at the outset of the pandemic that were intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and the worldwide efforts to isolate at home and practice social distancing caused a dramatic increase in unemployment and economic instability in the United States and in certain other regions in which Oaktree operates. While such instability in certain parts of the world, including in the United States, have shown signs of recovery in large part because of the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the continued uncertainty of COVID-19 variants may lead to renewed governmental efforts to mitigate COVID-19 spread seen at the beginning of the pandemic. Such\nrenewed mitigation efforts would create significant uncertainty and volatility in Oaktree's business and its funds' and their respective portfolio companies' businesses as compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nProlonged difficult market and economic conditions and uncertainty caused by COVID-19 will adversely impact the valuations of Oaktree's and its funds' investments, particularly if the value of an investment is determined in whole or in part by reference to public equity, public debt, or private debt markets. However, while any market dislocation caused by COVID-19 will adversely impact the value of Oaktree's and its funds' investments, the increased volatility in the financial markets may also present attractive investment opportunities for certain Oaktree investment strategies. Currently, we are unaware of any material risk to the stability of our condensed consolidated financial statements caused by any COVID-19 uncertainties or the materiality of any effect such uncertainties may have on our business and operations. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors- The coronavirus pandemic ( COVID-19\u201d) has significantly disrupted economic conditions and may adversely affect our operations, business, financial performance and operating results\" within this annual report.\nBrookfield Merger\nOn March 13, 2019, Oaktree, Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario ( Brookfield\u201d), Berlin Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Merger Sub\u201d) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield, Oslo Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( SellerCo\u201d) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. ( OCGH\u201d), and Oslo Holdings Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oaktree ( Seller MergerCo\u201d) entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective on September 30, 2019, (i) Merger Sub merged with and into Oaktree (the Merger\u201d), with Oaktree continuing as the surviving entity, and (ii) immediately following the Merger, SellerCo merged with and into Seller MergerCo (the Subsequent Merger\u201d and together with the Merger, the Mergers\u201d), with Seller MergerCo continuing as the surviving entity.\nUpon the completion of the Mergers on September 30, 2019, Brookfield acquired 61.2% of Oaktree's business in a stock and cash transaction. The remaining 38.8% of the business at that time continued to be owned by OCGH, whose unitholders consist primarily of Oaktree's founders and certain other members of management and current and former employees. As part of the Merger, Brookfield acquired all outstanding vested OCG Class A units for, at the election of OCG Class A unitholders, either $49.00 in cash or 1.0770 Class A shares of Brookfield per OCG Class A unit (subject to pro-ration to ensure that no more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate merger consideration is paid in the form of cash or stock), in each case, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. In addition, as part of the Subsequent Merger the founders, senior management, and current and former employee-unitholders of OCGH sold 20% of their OCGH units to Brookfield for the same consideration as the OCG Class A unitholders received in the merger.\nRestructuring Transaction\nOn the closing date of the Mergers, we and certain other entities entered into a Restructuring Agreement (the Restructuring\u201d) pursuant to which our direct and indirect ownership of general partner and limited partner interests in certain Oaktree Operating Group entities were transferred to newly-formed, indirect subsidiaries of Brookfield as of October 1, 2019. As a result, on October 1, 2019, four of the six Oaktree Operating Group entities were no longer our indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements will reflect our indirect economic interest in only two of the Oaktree Operating Group entities: (i) Oaktree Capital I, L.P. ( Oaktree Capital I\u201d), which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which holds a majority of Oaktree's investments in its funds and (ii) Oaktree Capital Management (Cayman), L.P. ( OCM Cayman\u201d), which represents Oaktree's non-U.S. fee business. As of October 1, 2019, our consolidated financial statements will no longer reflect any economic interests in the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities: (i) Oaktree Capital II, L.P. ( Oaktree Capital II\u201d), which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which includes Oaktree's investments in certain funds and other businesses, including Oaktree's investment in DoubleLine Capital, L.P., (ii) Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ( OCM\u201d), an entity that serves as the U.S. registered investment adviser to most of the Oaktree funds, (iii) Oaktree Investment Holdings, L.P. ( Oaktree Investment Holdings\u201d), which holds certain corporate investments in other entities and (iv) Oaktree AIF Investments, L.P. ( Oaktree AIF\u201d), which primarily holds interests in certain Oaktree fund investments for regulatory and structuring purposes. As a consequence, the assets of Oaktree Capital II, OCM, Oaktree Investment Holdings and Oaktree AIF will no longer support our operations. Please see Business-Organizational Structure\u201d in this annual report for a diagram of our organizational structure after the Restructuring.\nPrior to the Restructuring on October 1, 2019, our consolidated operating results included substantially all of the revenues and expenses of the Oaktree Operating Group and related consolidated funds and investment vehicles. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our consolidated operating results reflect only Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and related consolidated funds and investment vehicles. Since the deconsolidation of the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities was not required to be presented on a retrospective basis, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflect a full year of activities for Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and related funds and investment vehicles and only nine months of activities for the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities and related funds and investment vehicles and, as a result, are not directly comparable to prior periods. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 only reflect activities for Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and related funds and investment vehicles and do not include any activity for the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities and related funds and investment vehicles and, as a result, are not directly comparable to prior periods.\nAs a result of the Restructuring of our business, references to Oaktree\u201d in this annual report will generally refer to the collective business of the Oaktree Operating Group, of which we are a component.\nUnderstanding Our Results-Consolidation of Oaktree Funds\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires us to consolidate entities in which we have a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. A limited partnership or similar entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) if the unaffiliated limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. Most of the Oaktree funds are VIEs because they have not granted unaffiliated limited partners substantive kick-out or participating rights. The Company consolidates those VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. For entities that are not VIEs, consolidation is evaluated through a majority voting interest model. Please see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information.\nWe do not consolidate most of the Oaktree funds that are VIEs because we are not the primary beneficiary due to the fact that our fee arrangements are considered at-market and thus not deemed to be variable interests, and we do not hold any other interests in those funds that are considered to be more than insignificant. However, investment vehicles in which we have a significant investment, such as CLOs and certain Oaktree funds, are consolidated ( consolidated funds\u201d). When a CLO or fund is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the consolidated funds on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those consolidated funds, which are held by third-party investors, are reflected as debt obligations of CLOs or non-controlling interests in consolidated funds in the consolidated financial statements. All of the revenues earned by us as investment manager of the consolidated funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from and funded by third-party investors, the consolidation of a fund does not impact net income or loss attributable to us.\nCertain entities in which we have the ability to exert significant influence, including unconsolidated Oaktree funds for which we act as general partner, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the Restructuring, we re-assessed our prior variable interest entity consolidation determinations, noting that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of three funds in which our direct ownership interests are held by Oaktree Operating Group entities that are no longer directly controlled by us.\nRevenues\nOur business generates three types of revenue: management fees, incentive income and investment income. Management fees earned from third parties are billed monthly or quarterly based on annual rates and are typically earned for each of the funds that we manage. The contractual terms of management fees generally vary by fund structure. Management fees also may include performance-based fees earned from certain open-end and evergreen fund accounts. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our management fees consist primarily of fees earned from funds managed by OCM Cayman and sub-advisory fees for services provided to OCM. We also have the potential to earn incentive income from most of the closed-end and certain evergreen funds managed by Oaktree in our capacity as the general partner of those funds. These closed-end funds generally provide that we receive incentive income only after we have returned to our investors all of their contributed capital plus an annual preferred return, typically 8%. Once this occurs, we generally receive as incentive income 80% of all distributions otherwise attributable to our investors, and those investors receive the remaining 20% until we have received, as incentive income, 20% of all such distributions in excess of the contributed capital from the inception of the fund. Thereafter, all such future distributions attributable to our investors are distributed 80% to those investors and 20% to us as incentive income. Our third revenue source, investment income, represents our pro-rata share of income or loss from our investments, generally in our capacity as general partner in Oaktree funds and as an investor in our CLOs and third-party managed funds and companies.\nWe may earn incentive income upon deconsolidation of a SPAC arising from the completion of a merger with an identified target. Upon deconsolidation, we will derecognize the net assets of the entity and record any gain or loss related to the remeasurement of its investments to fair value as incentive income in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent fair value changes in our investments held in the entity will be recorded in investment income in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nOur consolidated revenues reflect the elimination of all management fees, incentive income and investment income earned related to consolidated Oaktree funds. Investment income is presented within the other income (loss) section of our consolidated statements of operations. Please see Business-Structure and Operation of Our Business-Structure of Funds\u201d in this annual report for a detailed discussion of the structure of Oaktree funds.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits expense reflects all compensation-related items not directly related to incentive income, investment income or the vesting of Class A units, OCGH units, OCGH equity value units ( EVUs\u201d), deferred equity units and other performance-based units, and includes salaries, bonuses, compensation based on management fees or a definition of profits, employee benefits, payroll taxes and phantom equity awards. Phantom equity awards represent liability-classified awards subject to vesting and remeasurement at the end of each reporting period. Phantom equity award expense reflects the vesting of those liability-classified awards, the equity distribution declared in the period and changes in the Class A unit trading price. Compensation and benefits expense reflects the gross-up of reimbursable costs incurred on behalf of Oaktree funds in which the Company has determined it is the principal. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our consolidated operating results primarily include compensation and benefits expense related to employees of OCM Cayman.\nEquity-based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation expense reflects the non-cash charge associated with grants of Class A units, OCGH units, EVUs, deferred equity units and other performance-based units. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our consolidated operating results primarily include equity-based compensation expense related to employees of OCM Cayman.\nIncentive Income Compensation\nIncentive income compensation expense primarily reflects compensation directly related to incentive income, which generally consists of percentage interests (sometimes referred to as points\u201d or an allocation of shares received upon the completion of a successful SPAC merger) that are granted to Oaktree investment professionals associated with the particular fund or SPAC that generated the incentive income, and secondarily, compensation directly related to investment income. There is no fixed percentage for the incentive income-related portion of this compensation, either by fund, SPAC or strategy. In general, within a particular strategy more recent funds have a higher percentage of aggregate incentive income compensation expense than do older funds. The percentage that consolidated incentive income compensation expense represents of the particular period's consolidated incentive income may not be meaningful because incentive income from consolidated funds or SPACs is eliminated in consolidation, whereas no incentive income compensation expense is eliminated in consolidation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense includes costs related to occupancy, outside auditors, tax professionals, legal advisers, research, consultants, travel and entertainment, communications and information services, business process outsourcing, foreign-exchange activity, insurance, placement costs, changes in the contingent consideration liability, and other general items related directly to the Company's operations. These expenses are net of amounts borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' non-controlling interests in consolidated funds. General and administrative expense reflects the gross-up of reimbursable costs incurred on behalf of Oaktree funds in which the Company has determined it is the principal. Subsequent to the Restructuring, general and administrative expenses primarily include direct and reimbursable expenses incurred by Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and the Company's share of certain expenses through a service agreement with OCM.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes costs associated with the purchase of furniture and equipment, capitalized software, office leasehold improvements and acquired intangibles. Furniture and equipment and capitalized software costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the respective estimated useful life or the lease term. Acquired intangibles primarily relate to contractual rights and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to 25 years. Subsequent to the Restructuring, the majority of Oaktree's acquired intangible assets are no longer included in our consolidated statement of financial condition.\nConsolidated Fund Expenses\nConsolidated fund expenses consist primarily of costs, expenses and fees that are incurred by, or arise out of the operation and activities of or otherwise are related to, our consolidated funds, including, without limitation, travel expenses, professional fees, research and software expenses, insurance, and other costs associated with administering and supporting those funds. Inasmuch as most of these fund expenses are borne by third-party investors, they reduce the investors' interests in the consolidated funds and have no impact on net income or loss attributable to the Company.\nOther Income (Loss)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily reflects the interest expense of the consolidated funds, as well as the interest expense of Oaktree and its operating subsidiaries. Prior to the Restructuring, our financial statements reflected debt service of the entire Oaktree Operating Group. After the Restructuring since OCM has historically been the only direct borrower or issuer under credit agreements and private placement notes with third parties and made all payments of principal and interest, our financial statements generally will not reflect debt obligations, interest expense or related liabilities associated with our operating subsidiaries, until such time as Oaktree Capital I, one of our two remaining Oaktree Operating Group entities, directly borrows or issues notes under such arrangements.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income consists of interest and dividend income earned on the investments held by our consolidated funds, and interest income earned by Oaktree and its operating subsidiaries.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Consolidated Funds' Investments\nNet realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds' investments consists of realized gains and losses arising from dispositions of investments held by our consolidated funds.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds' Investments\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds' investments reflects both unrealized gains and losses on investments held by our consolidated funds and the reversal upon disposition of investments of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for those investments.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income represents our pro-rata share of income or loss from our investments, generally in our capacity as general partner in certain Oaktree funds and as an investor in our CLOs and third-party managed funds and companies. Investment income, as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations, excludes investment income earned by us from our consolidated funds.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net represents non-operating income or expense.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is a publicly traded partnership. Because it satisfies the qualifying income test, it is not required to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes; rather it is taxed as a partnership. The Company currently holds interests in Oaktree Capital I, L.P. (a non-corporate entity that is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax) and Oaktree Capital Management (Cayman), L.P. (which holds subsidiaries that are taxable in non-U.S. jurisdictions).\nPrior to the Restructuring on October 1, 2019, Oaktree Holdings, Inc. and Oaktree AIF Holdings, Inc., which were two of the Company's Intermediate Holding Companies and wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries, were subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. The remainder of the Company's income was generally not subject to U.S. corporate-level taxation.\nUpon the Restructuring, Oaktree Holdings, Inc. and Oaktree AIF Holdings, Inc. merged with and into newly formed, indirect subsidiaries of Brookfield, with those subsidiaries surviving the mergers. As a result, as of October 1, 2019, Oaktree Holdings, Inc. and Oaktree AIF Holdings, Inc. ceased to exist and the Company no longer includes\non our financial statements economic interests in Oaktree Capital II, Oaktree Investment Holdings, OCM, and Oaktree AIF. All deferred tax balances related to these entities were deconsolidated as part of the Restructuring effective October 1, 2019.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets would be reduced by a valuation allowance if it becomes more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company analyzes its tax filing positions for all open tax years in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns. If the Company determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a reserve is established. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. The Company reviews its tax positions quarterly and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available.\nThe Oaktree funds are generally not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and, consequently, no income tax provision has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because individual partners are responsible for their proportionate share of the taxable income.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in our financial statements. These interests fall into two categories:\n\u2022Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. This category represents the economic interests of the unaffiliated investors in the consolidated funds, as well as the equity interests held by third-party investors in CLOs that had not yet priced as of the respective period end. Those interests are primarily driven by the investment performance of the consolidated funds. In comparison to net income, this measure excludes our operating results and other items solely attributable to the Company; and,\n\u2022Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. This category primarily represents the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH ( OCGH non-controlling interest\u201d), as well as the economic interest in certain consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties. Prior to the Restructuring, this category included the OCGH non-controlling interest in all six Oaktree Operating Group entities; subsequent to the Restructuring, it includes only the OCGH non-controlling interest in Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman. The OCGH non-controlling interest is determined at the Oaktree Operating Group level based on the weighted average proportionate share of Oaktree Operating Group units held by the OCGH unitholders. Inasmuch as the number of outstanding Oaktree Operating Group units corresponds with the total number of outstanding Class A and OCGH units, changes in the economic interest held by the OCGH unitholders are driven by our additional issuances of Class A and OCGH units, as well as repurchases and forfeitures of, and exchanges between, Class A and OCGH units. Certain of our expenses, such as income tax and related administrative expenses of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC and its Intermediate Holding Companies, are solely attributable to the Class A unitholders. Please see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH.\nNet Income Attributable to Preferred Unitholders\nThis category represents distributions declared, if any, on our preferred units. Please see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that we believe provide important information and data regarding our business. As a result of the Restructuring, a substantial portion of our revenues will be comprised of incentive income and investment income earned in our capacity as general partner of certain Oaktree funds. To analyze and monitor our operating performance we utilize incentive-creating AUM, incentives created (fund level) and accrued incentives (fund level). These operating metrics provide us with detailed information and insight into the operating performance of the funds we manage.\nIncentive-creating Assets Under Management.\nIncentive-creating AUM refers to the AUM that may eventually produce incentive income. It generally represents the NAV of Oaktree funds for which we are entitled to receive an incentive allocation, excluding CLOs and investments made by us and our or Oaktree employees and directors (which are not subject to an incentive allocation) and gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), net of cash, for our BDCs. All funds for which we are entitled to receive an incentive allocation are included in incentive-creating AUM, regardless of whether or not they are currently above their preferred return or high-water mark and therefore generating incentives. Incentive-creating AUM does not include undrawn capital commitments.\nAccrued Incentives (Fund Level) and Incentives Created (Fund Level)\nOaktree funds record as accrued incentives the incentive income that would be paid to us if the funds were liquidated at their reported values as of the date of the financial statements. Incentives created (fund level) refers to the gross amount of potential incentives generated by these funds during the period. We refer to the amount of accrued incentives recognized as revenue by us as incentive income. Amounts recognized by us as incentive income are no longer included in accrued incentives (fund level), the term we use for remaining fund-level accruals. The amount of incentives created may fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in the fair value of the underlying investments of the fund, as well as incentives created in excess of our typical 20% share due to catch-up allocations for applicable closed-end funds. In general, while in the catch-up layer, approximately 80% of any increase or decrease, respectively, in the fund's NAV results in a commensurate amount of positive or negative incentives created (fund level).\nThe same performance and market risks inherent in incentives created (fund level) affect the ability to ultimately realize accrued incentives (fund level). One consequence of the accounting method we follow for incentives created (fund level) is that accrued incentives (fund level) is an off-balance sheet metric, rather than being an on-balance sheet receivable that could require reduction if fund performance suffers. We track accrued incentives (fund level) because it provides an indication of potential future value, though the timing and ultimate realization of that value are uncertain.\nIncentives created (fund level), incentive income and accrued incentives (fund level) are presented gross, without deduction for direct compensation expense that is owed to Oaktree investment professionals associated with the particular fund when we earn the incentive income. We call that charge incentive income compensation expense.\u201d Incentive income compensation expense varies by the investment strategy and vintage of the particular fund, among many other factors.\nIncentives created (fund level) often reflects investments measured at fair value and therefore is subject to risk of substantial fluctuation by the time the underlying investments are liquidated.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC and the related notes included within this annual report. For a discussion and analysis of historical periods ended before January 1, 2020, please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. The factors listed under Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this annual report provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in any forward-looking statements.\nBusiness Overview\nOaktree is a leading global alternative investment management firm with expertise in investing in credit, real assets, private equity, and listed equities. Oaktree's mission is to deliver superior investment results with risk under control and to conduct its business with the highest integrity. Oaktree emphasizes an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to its investments. Over more than three decades, Oaktree has developed a large and growing client base through its ability to identify and capitalize on opportunities for attractive investment returns in less efficient markets.\nOaktree was formed in 1995 by a group of individuals who had been investing together since the mid-1980s. Oaktree's founders were pioneers in the management of high yield bonds, convertible securities and distressed debt. From those roots Oaktree has developed a diversified mix of specialized credit- and equity-oriented strategies. Oaktree operates according to a unifying investment philosophy, which consists of six tenets-risk control, consistency, market inefficiency, specialization, bottom-up analysis and disavowal of market timing-and is complemented by a set of core business principles that articulate our commitment to excellence in investing, commonality of interests with clients, a collaborative and cooperative culture, and a disciplined, opportunistic approach to the expansion of products.\nBusiness Environment and Developments\nAs a global investment manager, Oaktree is affected by a wide range of factors, including the condition of the global economy and financial markets; the relative attractiveness of Oaktree's investment strategies and investors' demand for them; and regulatory or other governmental policies or actions. Global economic conditions can significantly impact the values of Oaktree's and its funds' investments and the ability to make new investments or sell existing investments for these funds. Historically, however, Oaktree's diversified nature, of both its investment strategies and revenue mix, has generally allowed it to benefit from both strong and weak economic environments. Weak economies and the declining financial markets that typically accompany them tend to dampen revenues from asset-based management fees, investment realizations or price appreciation, but their prospect can present opportunities to raise relatively larger amounts of capital for certain strategies, especially opportunistic credit. Additionally, weak financial markets may also present more opportunities for funds to make investments at reduced prices. Conversely, strong financial markets generally increase the value of fund investments, which positions Oaktree, and us, for growth in management fees that are based on asset value, and typically create favorable exit opportunities that enhance the prospect for incentive income and fund-related realized investment income proceeds. Those same markets may delay or diminish opportunities to deploy capital and thus management fees from certain funds.\nCOVID-19 continues to pose serious threats to the health and economic wellbeing of the worldwide population and the overall economy in light of COVID-19 variants that seem to spread more easily than the original COVID-19 virus. The number of reported COVID-19 infections are rising again in certain countries worldwide likely due to these variants and the relaxation of certain efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 previously imposed by governmental authorities. While the equity markets have rebounded from their steep declines in March 2020 after the World Health Organization announced that infections of COVID-19 had become a pandemic, there is continued uncertainty as to the duration of the global health and economic impact caused by COVID-19 even with COVID-19 vaccines now available. Actions at the outset of the pandemic that were intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and the worldwide efforts to isolate at home and practice social distancing caused a dramatic increase in unemployment and economic instability in the United States and in certain other regions in which Oaktree operates. While such instability in certain parts of the world, including in the United States, have shown signs of recovery in large part because of the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the continued uncertainty of COVID-19 variants may lead to renewed governmental efforts to mitigate COVID-19 spread seen at the beginning of the pandemic. Such\nrenewed mitigation efforts would create significant uncertainty and volatility in Oaktree's business and its funds' and their respective portfolio companies' businesses as compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nProlonged difficult market and economic conditions and uncertainty caused by COVID-19 will adversely impact the valuations of Oaktree's and its funds' investments, particularly if the value of an investment is determined in whole or in part by reference to public equity, public debt, or private debt markets. However, while any market dislocation caused by COVID-19 will adversely impact the value of Oaktree's and its funds' investments, the increased volatility in the financial markets may also present attractive investment opportunities for certain Oaktree investment strategies. Currently, we are unaware of any material risk to the stability of our condensed consolidated financial statements caused by any COVID-19 uncertainties or the materiality of any effect such uncertainties may have on our business and operations. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors- The coronavirus pandemic ( COVID-19\u201d) has significantly disrupted economic conditions and may adversely affect our operations, business, financial performance and operating results\" within this annual report.\nBrookfield Merger\nOn March 13, 2019, Oaktree, Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario ( Brookfield\u201d), Berlin Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Merger Sub\u201d) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield, Oslo Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( SellerCo\u201d) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. ( OCGH\u201d), and Oslo Holdings Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oaktree ( Seller MergerCo\u201d) entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective on September 30, 2019, (i) Merger Sub merged with and into Oaktree (the Merger\u201d), with Oaktree continuing as the surviving entity, and (ii) immediately following the Merger, SellerCo merged with and into Seller MergerCo (the Subsequent Merger\u201d and together with the Merger, the Mergers\u201d), with Seller MergerCo continuing as the surviving entity.\nUpon the completion of the Mergers on September 30, 2019, Brookfield acquired 61.2% of Oaktree's business in a stock and cash transaction. The remaining 38.8% of the business at that time continued to be owned by OCGH, whose unitholders consist primarily of Oaktree's founders and certain other members of management and current and former employees. As part of the Merger, Brookfield acquired all outstanding vested OCG Class A units for, at the election of OCG Class A unitholders, either $49.00 in cash or 1.0770 Class A shares of Brookfield per OCG Class A unit (subject to pro-ration to ensure that no more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate merger consideration is paid in the form of cash or stock), in each case, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. In addition, as part of the Subsequent Merger the founders, senior management, and current and former employee-unitholders of OCGH sold 20% of their OCGH units to Brookfield for the same consideration as the OCG Class A unitholders received in the merger.\nRestructuring Transaction\nOn the closing date of the Mergers, we and certain other entities entered into a Restructuring Agreement (the Restructuring\u201d) pursuant to which our direct and indirect ownership of general partner and limited partner interests in certain Oaktree Operating Group entities were transferred to newly-formed, indirect subsidiaries of Brookfield as of October 1, 2019. As a result, on October 1, 2019, four of the six Oaktree Operating Group entities were no longer our indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements will reflect our indirect economic interest in only two of the Oaktree Operating Group entities: (i) Oaktree Capital I, L.P. ( Oaktree Capital I\u201d), which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which holds a majority of Oaktree's investments in its funds and (ii) Oaktree Capital Management (Cayman), L.P. ( OCM Cayman\u201d), which represents Oaktree's non-U.S. fee business. As of October 1, 2019, our consolidated financial statements will no longer reflect any economic interests in the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities: (i) Oaktree Capital II, L.P. ( Oaktree Capital II\u201d), which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which includes Oaktree's investments in certain funds and other businesses, including Oaktree's investment in DoubleLine Capital, L.P., (ii) Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ( OCM\u201d), an entity that serves as the U.S. registered investment adviser to most of the Oaktree funds, (iii) Oaktree Investment Holdings, L.P. ( Oaktree Investment Holdings\u201d), which holds certain corporate investments in other entities and (iv) Oaktree AIF Investments, L.P. ( Oaktree AIF\u201d), which primarily holds interests in certain Oaktree fund investments for regulatory and structuring purposes. As a consequence, the assets of Oaktree Capital II, OCM, Oaktree Investment Holdings and Oaktree AIF will no longer support our operations. Please see Business-Organizational Structure\u201d in this annual report for a diagram of our organizational structure after the Restructuring.\nPrior to the Restructuring on October 1, 2019, our consolidated operating results included substantially all of the revenues and expenses of the Oaktree Operating Group and related consolidated funds and investment vehicles. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our consolidated operating results reflect only Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and related consolidated funds and investment vehicles. Since the deconsolidation of the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities was not required to be presented on a retrospective basis, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflect a full year of activities for Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and related funds and investment vehicles and only nine months of activities for the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities and related funds and investment vehicles and, as a result, are not directly comparable to prior periods. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 only reflect activities for Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and related funds and investment vehicles and do not include any activity for the remaining four Oaktree Operating Group entities and related funds and investment vehicles and, as a result, are not directly comparable to prior periods.\nAs a result of the Restructuring of our business, references to Oaktree\u201d in this annual report will generally refer to the collective business of the Oaktree Operating Group, of which we are a component.\nUnderstanding Our Results-Consolidation of Oaktree Funds\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) requires us to consolidate entities in which we have a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. A limited partnership or similar entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) if the unaffiliated limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. Most of the Oaktree funds are VIEs because they have not granted unaffiliated limited partners substantive kick-out or participating rights. The Company consolidates those VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. For entities that are not VIEs, consolidation is evaluated through a majority voting interest model. Please see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information.\nWe do not consolidate most of the Oaktree funds that are VIEs because we are not the primary beneficiary due to the fact that our fee arrangements are considered at-market and thus not deemed to be variable interests, and we do not hold any other interests in those funds that are considered to be more than insignificant. However, investment vehicles in which we have a significant investment, such as CLOs and certain Oaktree funds, are consolidated ( consolidated funds\u201d). When a CLO or fund is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the consolidated funds on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those consolidated funds, which are held by third-party investors, are reflected as debt obligations of CLOs or non-controlling interests in consolidated funds in the consolidated financial statements. All of the revenues earned by us as investment manager of the consolidated funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from and funded by third-party investors, the consolidation of a fund does not impact net income or loss attributable to us.\nCertain entities in which we have the ability to exert significant influence, including unconsolidated Oaktree funds for which we act as general partner, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the Restructuring, we re-assessed our prior variable interest entity consolidation determinations, noting that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of three funds in which our direct ownership interests are held by Oaktree Operating Group entities that are no longer directly controlled by us.\nRevenues\nOur business generates three types of revenue: management fees, incentive income and investment income. Management fees earned from third parties are billed monthly or quarterly based on annual rates and are typically earned for each of the funds that we manage. The contractual terms of management fees generally vary by fund structure. Management fees also may include performance-based fees earned from certain open-end and evergreen fund accounts. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our management fees consist primarily of fees earned from funds managed by OCM Cayman and sub-advisory fees for services provided to OCM. We also have the potential to earn incentive income from most of the closed-end and certain evergreen funds managed by Oaktree in our capacity as the general partner of those funds. These closed-end funds generally provide that we receive incentive income only after we have returned to our investors all of their contributed capital plus an annual preferred return, typically 8%. Once this occurs, we generally receive as incentive income 80% of all distributions otherwise attributable to our investors, and those investors receive the remaining 20% until we have received, as incentive income, 20% of all such distributions in excess of the contributed capital from the inception of the fund. Thereafter, all such future distributions attributable to our investors are distributed 80% to those investors and 20% to us as incentive income. Our third revenue source, investment income, represents our pro-rata share of income or loss from our investments, generally in our capacity as general partner in Oaktree funds and as an investor in our CLOs and third-party managed funds and companies.\nWe may earn incentive income upon deconsolidation of a SPAC arising from the completion of a merger with an identified target. Upon deconsolidation, we will derecognize the net assets of the entity and record any gain or loss related to the remeasurement of its investments to fair value as incentive income in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent fair value changes in our investments held in the entity will be recorded in investment income in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nOur consolidated revenues reflect the elimination of all management fees, incentive income and investment income earned related to consolidated Oaktree funds. Investment income is presented within the other income (loss) section of our consolidated statements of operations. Please see Business-Structure and Operation of Our Business-Structure of Funds\u201d in this annual report for a detailed discussion of the structure of Oaktree funds.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits expense reflects all compensation-related items not directly related to incentive income, investment income or the vesting of Class A units, OCGH units, OCGH equity value units ( EVUs\u201d), deferred equity units and other performance-based units, and includes salaries, bonuses, compensation based on management fees or a definition of profits, employee benefits, payroll taxes and phantom equity awards. Phantom equity awards represent liability-classified awards subject to vesting and remeasurement at the end of each reporting period. Phantom equity award expense reflects the vesting of those liability-classified awards, the equity distribution declared in the period and changes in the Class A unit trading price. Compensation and benefits expense reflects the gross-up of reimbursable costs incurred on behalf of Oaktree funds in which the Company has determined it is the principal. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our consolidated operating results primarily include compensation and benefits expense related to employees of OCM Cayman.\nEquity-based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation expense reflects the non-cash charge associated with grants of Class A units, OCGH units, EVUs, deferred equity units and other performance-based units. Subsequent to the Restructuring, our consolidated operating results primarily include equity-based compensation expense related to employees of OCM Cayman.\nIncentive Income Compensation\nIncentive income compensation expense primarily reflects compensation directly related to incentive income, which generally consists of percentage interests (sometimes referred to as points\u201d or an allocation of shares received upon the completion of a successful SPAC merger) that are granted to Oaktree investment professionals associated with the particular fund or SPAC that generated the incentive income, and secondarily, compensation directly related to investment income. There is no fixed percentage for the incentive income-related portion of this compensation, either by fund, SPAC or strategy. In general, within a particular strategy more recent funds have a higher percentage of aggregate incentive income compensation expense than do older funds. The percentage that consolidated incentive income compensation expense represents of the particular period's consolidated incentive income may not be meaningful because incentive income from consolidated funds or SPACs is eliminated in consolidation, whereas no incentive income compensation expense is eliminated in consolidation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense includes costs related to occupancy, outside auditors, tax professionals, legal advisers, research, consultants, travel and entertainment, communications and information services, business process outsourcing, foreign-exchange activity, insurance, placement costs, changes in the contingent consideration liability, and other general items related directly to the Company's operations. These expenses are net of amounts borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' non-controlling interests in consolidated funds. General and administrative expense reflects the gross-up of reimbursable costs incurred on behalf of Oaktree funds in which the Company has determined it is the principal. Subsequent to the Restructuring, general and administrative expenses primarily include direct and reimbursable expenses incurred by Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman and the Company's share of certain expenses through a service agreement with OCM.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes costs associated with the purchase of furniture and equipment, capitalized software, office leasehold improvements and acquired intangibles. Furniture and equipment and capitalized software costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the respective estimated useful life or the lease term. Acquired intangibles primarily relate to contractual rights and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to 25 years. Subsequent to the Restructuring, the majority of Oaktree's acquired intangible assets are no longer included in our consolidated statement of financial condition.\nConsolidated Fund Expenses\nConsolidated fund expenses consist primarily of costs, expenses and fees that are incurred by, or arise out of the operation and activities of or otherwise are related to, our consolidated funds, including, without limitation, travel expenses, professional fees, research and software expenses, insurance, and other costs associated with administering and supporting those funds. Inasmuch as most of these fund expenses are borne by third-party investors, they reduce the investors' interests in the consolidated funds and have no impact on net income or loss attributable to the Company.\nOther Income (Loss)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily reflects the interest expense of the consolidated funds, as well as the interest expense of Oaktree and its operating subsidiaries. Prior to the Restructuring, our financial statements reflected debt service of the entire Oaktree Operating Group. After the Restructuring since OCM has historically been the only direct borrower or issuer under credit agreements and private placement notes with third parties and made all payments of principal and interest, our financial statements generally will not reflect debt obligations, interest expense or related liabilities associated with our operating subsidiaries, until such time as Oaktree Capital I, one of our two remaining Oaktree Operating Group entities, directly borrows or issues notes under such arrangements.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income consists of interest and dividend income earned on the investments held by our consolidated funds, and interest income earned by Oaktree and its operating subsidiaries.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Consolidated Funds' Investments\nNet realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds' investments consists of realized gains and losses arising from dispositions of investments held by our consolidated funds.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds' Investments\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds' investments reflects both unrealized gains and losses on investments held by our consolidated funds and the reversal upon disposition of investments of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for those investments.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income represents our pro-rata share of income or loss from our investments, generally in our capacity as general partner in certain Oaktree funds and as an investor in our CLOs and third-party managed funds and companies. Investment income, as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations, excludes investment income earned by us from our consolidated funds.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net represents non-operating income or expense.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is a publicly traded partnership. Because it satisfies the qualifying income test, it is not required to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes; rather it is taxed as a partnership. The Company currently holds interests in Oaktree Capital I, L.P. (a non-corporate entity that is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax) and Oaktree Capital Management (Cayman), L.P. (which holds subsidiaries that are taxable in non-U.S. jurisdictions).\nPrior to the Restructuring on October 1, 2019, Oaktree Holdings, Inc. and Oaktree AIF Holdings, Inc., which were two of the Company's Intermediate Holding Companies and wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries, were subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. The remainder of the Company's income was generally not subject to U.S. corporate-level taxation.\nUpon the Restructuring, Oaktree Holdings, Inc. and Oaktree AIF Holdings, Inc. merged with and into newly formed, indirect subsidiaries of Brookfield, with those subsidiaries surviving the mergers. As a result, as of October 1, 2019, Oaktree Holdings, Inc. and Oaktree AIF Holdings, Inc. ceased to exist and the Company no longer includes\non our financial statements economic interests in Oaktree Capital II, Oaktree Investment Holdings, OCM, and Oaktree AIF. All deferred tax balances related to these entities were deconsolidated as part of the Restructuring effective October 1, 2019.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets would be reduced by a valuation allowance if it becomes more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company analyzes its tax filing positions for all open tax years in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns. If the Company determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a reserve is established. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. The Company reviews its tax positions quarterly and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available.\nThe Oaktree funds are generally not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and, consequently, no income tax provision has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because individual partners are responsible for their proportionate share of the taxable income.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in our financial statements. These interests fall into two categories:\n\u2022Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. This category represents the economic interests of the unaffiliated investors in the consolidated funds, as well as the equity interests held by third-party investors in CLOs that had not yet priced as of the respective period end. Those interests are primarily driven by the investment performance of the consolidated funds. In comparison to net income, this measure excludes our operating results and other items solely attributable to the Company; and,\n\u2022Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. This category primarily represents the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH ( OCGH non-controlling interest\u201d), as well as the economic interest in certain consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties. Prior to the Restructuring, this category included the OCGH non-controlling interest in all six Oaktree Operating Group entities; subsequent to the Restructuring, it includes only the OCGH non-controlling interest in Oaktree Capital I and OCM Cayman. The OCGH non-controlling interest is determined at the Oaktree Operating Group level based on the weighted average proportionate share of Oaktree Operating Group units held by the OCGH unitholders. Inasmuch as the number of outstanding Oaktree Operating Group units corresponds with the total number of outstanding Class A and OCGH units, changes in the economic interest held by the OCGH unitholders are driven by our additional issuances of Class A and OCGH units, as well as repurchases and forfeitures of, and exchanges between, Class A and OCGH units. Certain of our expenses, such as income tax and related administrative expenses of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC and its Intermediate Holding Companies, are solely attributable to the Class A unitholders. Please see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH.\nNet Income Attributable to Preferred Unitholders\nThis category represents distributions declared, if any, on our preferred units. Please see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that we believe provide important information and data regarding our business. As a result of the Restructuring, a substantial portion of our revenues will be comprised of incentive income and investment income earned in our capacity as general partner of certain Oaktree funds. To analyze and monitor our operating performance we utilize incentive-creating AUM, incentives created (fund level) and accrued incentives (fund level). These operating metrics provide us with detailed information and insight into the operating performance of the funds we manage.\nIncentive-creating Assets Under Management.\nIncentive-creating AUM refers to the AUM that may eventually produce incentive income. It generally represents the NAV of Oaktree funds for which we are entitled to receive an incentive allocation, excluding CLOs and investments made by us and our or Oaktree employees and directors (which are not subject to an incentive allocation) and gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), net of cash, for our BDCs. All funds for which we are entitled to receive an incentive allocation are included in incentive-creating AUM, regardless of whether or not they are currently above their preferred return or high-water mark and therefore generating incentives. Incentive-creating AUM does not include undrawn capital commitments.\nAccrued Incentives (Fund Level) and Incentives Created (Fund Level)\nOaktree funds record as accrued incentives the incentive income that would be paid to us if the funds were liquidated at their reported values as of the date of the financial statements. Incentives created (fund level) refers to the gross amount of potential incentives generated by these funds during the period. We refer to the amount of accrued incentives recognized as revenue by us as incentive income. Amounts recognized by us as incentive income are no longer included in accrued incentives (fund level), the term we use for remaining fund-level accruals. The amount of incentives created may fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in the fair value of the underlying investments of the fund, as well as incentives created in excess of our typical 20% share due to catch-up allocations for applicable closed-end funds. In general, while in the catch-up layer, approximately 80% of any increase or decrease, respectively, in the fund's NAV results in a commensurate amount of positive or negative incentives created (fund level).\nThe same performance and market risks inherent in incentives created (fund level) affect the ability to ultimately realize accrued incentives (fund level). One consequence of the accounting method we follow for incentives created (fund level) is that accrued incentives (fund level) is an off-balance sheet metric, rather than being an on-balance sheet receivable that could require reduction if fund performance suffers. We track accrued incentives (fund level) because it provides an indication of potential future value, though the timing and ultimate realization of that value are uncertain.\nIncentives created (fund level), incentive income and accrued incentives (fund level) are presented gross, without deduction for direct compensation expense that is owed to Oaktree investment professionals associated with the particular fund when we earn the incentive income. We call that charge incentive income compensation expense.\u201d Incentive income compensation expense varies by the investment strategy and vintage of the particular fund, among many other factors.\nIncentives created (fund level) often reflects investments measured at fair value and therefore is subject to risk of substantial fluctuation by the time the underlying investments are liquidated. We earn the"}
