MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. All dollars are in thousands, except share data, unless otherwise noted.)\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information that the Company's management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements subject to various risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in \"Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\" and Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" included in this report.\nA discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented below. A discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found in Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2019.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company is a diverse company with a purpose to serve others and a vision to make customers' dreams possible by delivering customer focused products and services. The largest operating businesses engage in loan servicing; education technology, services, and payment processing; and communications. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is net interest income earned on a portfolio of federally insured student loans. The Company also makes investments to further diversify both within and outside of its historical core education-related businesses, including, but not limited to, investments in real estate, early-stage and emerging growth companies, and renewable energy.\nGAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income, Excluding Adjustments\nThe Company prepares its financial statements and presents its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, it also provides additional non-GAAP financial information related to specific items management believes to be important in the evaluation of its operating results and performance. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP net income to net income, excluding derivative market value and foreign currency transaction adjustments, and a discussion of why the Company believes providing this additional information is useful to investors, is provided below.\nTable 9: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income attributable to Nelnet, Inc.\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>141,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized derivative market value adjustments\n</td> <td>76,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,014) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect (a)\n</td> <td>(18,287) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Nelnet, Inc., excluding derivative market value adjustments (b)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income attributable to Nelnet, Inc.\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized derivative market value adjustments\n</td> <td>1.90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.02) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect (a)\n</td> <td>(0.45) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Nelnet, Inc., excluding derivative market value adjustments (b)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) The tax effects are calculated by multiplying the realized and unrealized derivative market value adjustments by the applicable statutory income tax rate.\n(b) \"Derivative market value adjustments\" includes both the realized portion of gains and losses (corresponding to variation margin received or paid on derivative instruments that are settled daily at a central clearinghouse) and the unrealized portion of gains and losses that are caused by changes in fair values of derivatives which do not qualify for \"hedge treatment\" under GAAP. \"Derivative market value adjustments\" does not include \"derivative settlements\" that represent the cash paid or received during the current period to settle with derivative instrument counterparties the economic effect of the Company's derivative instruments based on their contractual terms.\nThe accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings, with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria is met. Management has structured all of the Company's derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective; however, the Company's derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of derivative instruments is reported in current period earnings with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. Under GAAP, the cumulative net realized and unrealized gain or loss caused by changes in fair values of derivatives in which the Company plans to hold to maturity will equal zero over the life of the contract. However, the net realized and unrealized gain or loss during any given reporting period fluctuates significantly from period to period.\nThe Company believes these point-in-time estimates of asset and liability values related to its derivative instruments that are subject to interest rate fluctuations are subject to volatility mostly due to timing and market factors beyond the control of management, and affect the period-to-period comparability of the results of operations. Accordingly, the Company's management utilizes operating results excluding these items for comparability purposes when making decisions regarding the Company's performance and in presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders, and investors. Consequently, the Company reports this non-GAAP information because the Company believes that it provides additional information regarding operational and performance indicators that are closely assessed by management. There is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for the presentation of such non-GAAP information, which is only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information that management utilizes to assess performance.\nGAAP net income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the following factors:\n\u2022The recognition of a net loss during 2019 as compared to a net gain in 2018 due to changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting;\n\u2022The recognition of $16.7 million ($12.7 million after tax) of expenses during 2019 to extinguish notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations prior to the notes' contractual maturities;\n\u2022The decrease in the average balance of loans due to the amortization of the FFELP loan portfolio;\n\u2022The decrease in loan spread on the Company's loan portfolio and related derivative settlements; and\n\u2022The increase in the provision for loan losses related to the Company's growing portfolio of consumer loans.\nThese factors were partially offset by the following items:\n\u2022The contribution to net income from the Company's Loan Servicing and Systems and Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing operating segments; and\n\u2022The recognition of a $17.3 million ($13.1 million after tax) gain from the sale of consumer loans in 2019.\nOperating Results\nThe Company earns net interest income on its loan portfolio, consisting primarily of FFELP loans, in its Asset Generation and Management (\"AGM\") operating segment. This segment is expected to generate a stable net interest margin and significant amounts of cash as the FFELP portfolio amortizes. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a $20.7 billion loan portfolio that management anticipates will amortize over the next approximately 20 years and has a weighted average remaining life of 8.8 years. The Company actively works to maximize the amount and timing of cash flows generated by its FFELP portfolio and seeks to acquire additional loan assets to leverage its servicing scale and expertise to generate incremental earnings and cash flow. However, due to the continued amortization of the Company's FFELP loan portfolio, over time, the Company's net income generated by the AGM segment will continue to decrease. The Company currently believes that in the short-term it will most likely not be able to invest the excess cash generated from the FFELP loan portfolio into assets that immediately generate the rates of return historically realized from that portfolio.\nIn addition, the Company earns fee-based revenue through the following reportable operating segments:\n\u2022Loan Servicing and Systems (\"LSS\") - referred to as Nelnet Diversified Services (\"NDS\")\n\u2022Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing (\"ETS&PP\") - referred to as Nelnet Business Services (\"NBS\")\n\u2022Communications - referred to as ALLO Communications (\"ALLO\")\nOther business activities and operating segments that are not reportable are combined and included in Corporate and Other Activities (\"Corporate\"). Corporate and Other Activities also includes income earned on certain investments and interest expense incurred on unsecured debt transactions.\nThe information below provides the operating results for each reportable operating segment and Corporate and Other Activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions). See \"Results of Operations\" for each reportable operating segment under this Item 7 for additional detail.\n(a) Revenue includes intersegment revenue earned by LSS as a result of servicing loans for AGM.\n(b) Total revenue includes \"net interest income\" and \"total other income\" from the Company's segment statements of income, excluding the impact from changes in fair values of derivatives. Net income excludes changes in fair values of derivatives, net of tax. For information regarding the exclusion of the impact from changes in fair values of derivatives adjustments, see \"GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income, Excluding Adjustments\" above.\nCertain events and transactions from 2019 and 2018, which have impacted or will impact the operating results of the Company and its operating segments, are discussed below.\nLoan Servicing and Systems\n\u2022On February 7, 2018, the Company acquired Great Lakes. The operating results of Great Lakes are reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Thus, there are twelve months of Great Lakes' operations included in 2019 as compared to approximately eleven months of activity in 2018.\n\u2022Nelnet Servicing, LLC (\"Nelnet Servicing\") and Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, Inc. (\"Great Lakes\") have student loan servicing contracts awarded by the Department in June 2009 to provide servicing for loans owned by the Department. As of December 31, 2019, Nelnet Servicing was servicing $183.8 billion of student loans for 5.6 million borrowers under its contract, and Great Lakes was servicing $240.0 billion of student loans for 7.4 million borrowers under its contract.\nNelnet Servicing and Great Lakes' servicing contracts with the Department previously provided for expiration on June 16, 2019. On May 15, 2019, Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes each received a contract extension from the Department's Office of Federal Student Aid (\"FSA\") pursuant to which FSA extended the expiration date of the current contracts to December 15, 2019. On November 26, 2019, Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes each received an additional extension from FSA on their contracts through December 14, 2020. The contract extensions also provide the potential for two additional six-month extensions at the Department's discretion through December 14, 2021.\nFSA is conducting a contract procurement process entitled Next Generation Financial Services Environment ( NextGen\u201d) for a new framework for the servicing of all student loans owned by the Department. On January 15, 2019, FSA issued solicitations for three NextGen components:\n\u2022NextGen Enhanced Processing Solution (\"EPS\")\n\u2022NextGen Business Process Operations (\"BPO\")\n\u2022NextGen Optimal Processing Solution (\"OPS\")\nOn April 1, 2019 and October 4, 2019, the Company responded to the EPS component. On January 16, 2020, FSA released an amendment to the EPS component and the Company responded on February 3, 2020. In addition, on August 1, 2019, the Company responded to the BPO component. On January 10, 2020, FSA released an amendment to the BPO component and the Company responded on January 30, 2020. The Company is also part of a team that has\nresponded and intends to respond to various aspects of the OPS component; however, on November 12, 2019, FSA put an indefinite hold on the OPS solicitation. The EPS and BPO components are essentially for the loan processing and servicing to be performed on a new single system, which the Company believes could have the most significant potential impact on the Company. The Company cannot predict the timing, nature, or outcome of these solicitations.\n\u2022The Loan Servicing and Systems segment will incur additional costs in 2020 to meet increased service and security standards under the current Department servicing contracts and to be responsive to the Department's procurement. As a result, the Company currently expects a significant decrease in this segment's operating margin and net income in 2020 from recent historical results.\nEducation Technology, Services, and Payment Processing\n\u2022On November 20, 2018, the Company acquired Tuition Management Systems (\"TMS\"), a services company that offers tuition payment plans, billing services, payment technology solutions, and refund management to educational institutions. The TMS acquisition added 380 higher education schools and 170 K-12 schools to the Company's customer base. The results of TMS' operations are reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, before tax operating margin (income before income taxes divided by net revenue) was 31.8 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively. The increase in the before tax operating margin in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to operating leverage and cost reductions resulting from the Company's decision in October 2018 to terminate its investment in a proprietary payment processing platform.\nCommunications\n\u2022ALLO recognized losses of $23.5 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in ALLO's net loss in 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense. ALLO recognized $10.0 million of interest expense to Nelnet, Inc. (parent company) during the year ended December 31, 2018. Subsequent to October 1, 2018, ALLO will not report interest expense in its income statement related to amounts contributed to ALLO from Nelnet, Inc. due to a recapitalization of ALLO. Excluding interest expense, the increase in ALLO's net loss in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to an increase in depreciation from significant property and equipment purchases over the last several years to support the Lincoln, Nebraska network build-out that was substantially completed in 2019.\n\u2022ALLO's management uses earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") to eliminate certain non-cash and non-operating items in order to consistently measure performance from period to period. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, ALLO had positive EBITDA of $6.2 million and negative EBITDA of $4.5 million, respectively. EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure which the Company believes provides useful additional information regarding a key metric used by management to assess ALLO's performance. See \"Communications Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Summary and Comparison of Operating Results\" below for additional information regarding the computation and use of EBITDA for ALLO.\n\u2022ALLO has made significant investments in its communications network and currently provides fiber directly to homes and businesses in communities in Nebraska and Colorado. ALLO plans to continue to increase market share and revenue in its existing markets and is currently evaluating opportunities to expand to other communities in the Midwest. ALLO began providing services in Lincoln, Nebraska in September 2016 as part of a multi-year project to pass substantially all commercial and residential properties in the community. As of the end of the first quarter of 2019, the build-out of the Lincoln community was substantially complete. For the year ended December 31, 2019, ALLO's capital expenditures were $45.0 million. The Company anticipates total ALLO network capital expenditures in 2020 will be approximately $35.0 million to $45.0 million. However, this amount could change based on customer demand for ALLO's services.\n\u2022The Company currently anticipates ALLO's operating results will be dilutive to the Company's consolidated earnings as it continues to develop and add customers to its network in Lincoln, Nebraska and other communities, due to large upfront capital expenditures and associated depreciation and upfront customer acquisition costs.\nAsset Generation and Management\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2019, the AGM segment recognized net interest income of $238.6 million, compared with $249.1 million in 2018. The Company maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility. The AGM segment recognized income from derivative settlements of $45.4 million in 2019, compared with income of $70.5 million in 2018. Derivative settlements for each applicable period should be evaluated with the Company's net interest income. Net interest income and derivative settlements for the AGM segment totaled $284.0 million and $319.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022The Company's average balance of loans decreased to $21.7 billion in 2019, compared with $22.6 billion in 2018. Loan spread decreased to 0.96 percent in 2019, compared with 0.99 percent in 2018. Core loan spread, which includes the impact of derivative settlements, decreased to 1.18 percent in 2019, compared with 1.32 percent in 2018. Core loan spread, a non-GAAP measure, is computed as set forth in \"Asset Generation and Management Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Loan Spread Analysis\" below. Management believes core loan spread is a useful supplemental non-GAAP measure that reflects adjustments for derivative settlements related to net interest income (loan spread). However, there is no comprehensive authoritative guidance for the presentation of this measure, which is only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information that management utilizes to assess performance.\nThe Company recognized $89.9 million and $121.7 million in fixed rate floor income in 2019 and 2018, respectively (which includes $40.2 million and $64.9 million, respectively, of settlement payments received on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income). Fixed rate floor income contributed 41 basis points and 55 basis points of core loan spread in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross fixed rate floor income was due to higher interest rates in 2019 as compared to 2018, and the decrease in derivative settlement payments received on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income was due to a decrease in the notional amount of derivatives outstanding in 2019 as compared to 2018, partially offset by higher interest rates.\n\u2022Provision for loan losses was $39.0 million and $23.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nProvision for loan losses for federally insured loans was $8.0 million and $14.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2018, the Company determined an additional allowance was necessary related to portfolios of federally insured loans that were purchased in prior periods, and recognized $5.0 million in provision expense related to these loans.\nProvision for loan losses for consumer loans was $31.0 million and $9.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in provision was a result of the increased amount of consumer loan purchases during 2019. The Company purchased $405.7 million of consumer loans during 2019 compared to $120.5 million during 2018.\n\u2022The Company recognized $16.7 million (pre-tax) of expenses in 2019 related to the extinguishment of notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations prior to the notes' contractual maturities (as further described below). These expenses consisted of premium payments made by the Company of $14.0 million and the write-off of $2.7 million of debt issuance costs.\n\u2022During 2019, the Company sold $227.0 million (par value) of consumer loans to an unrelated third party who securitized such loans. As partial consideration received for the consumer loans sold, the Company received a percentage interest of the residual interest of the consumer loan securitizations. The Company recognized a gain of $17.3 million (pre-tax) from the sale of these loans.\nCorporate and Other Activities\n\u2022The Company adopted a new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. The most significant impact of the standard to the Company relates to (1) the recognition of new right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet primarily for office, data center, and dark fiber operating leases; (2) the deconsolidation of assets and liabilities for certain sale-leaseback transactions arising from build-to-suit lease arrangements for which construction was completed and the Company is leasing the constructed assets that did not qualify for sale accounting prior to the adoption of the new standard; and (3) significant new disclosures about the Company's leasing activities.\nAdoption of the new standard resulted in recognizing lease liabilities of $33.7 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments. In addition, the Company recognized ROU assets of $32.8 million, which corresponds to the lease liabilities reduced by deferred rent expense as of the effective date. The Company also deconsolidated total assets of $43.8 million and total liabilities of $34.8 million for entities that had been consolidated\ndue to sale-leaseback transactions that failed to qualify for recognition as sales under the prior guidance. Deconsolidation of these entities reduced noncontrolling interests by $6.1 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $133.9 million. In addition, the Company had a portfolio of available-for-sale investments, consisting primarily of student loan asset-backed securities, with a fair value of $52.7 million as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022The Company has historically generated positive cash flow from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's net cash provided by operating activities was $298.9 million.\n\u2022On December 16, 2019, the Company amended its unsecured line of credit to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the facility from June 22, 2023 to December 16, 2024 and increase the size of the facility from $382.5 million to $455.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the unsecured line of credit had $50.0 million outstanding and $405.0 million was available for future use. The line of credit provides that the Company may increase the aggregate financing commitments, through the existing lenders and/or through new lenders, up to a total of $550.0 million, subject to certain conditions.\n\u2022The majority of the Company's portfolio of student loans is funded in asset-backed securitizations that will generate significant earnings and cash flow over the life of these transactions. As of December 31, 2019, the Company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its securitization portfolio to be approximately $1.89 billion, of which approximately $1.28 billion will be generated over the next six years.\n\u2022Certain of the Company's asset-backed securitizations were structured as Turbo Transactions\u201d which required all cash generated from the student loans (including excess spread) to be directed toward payment of interest and any outstanding principal generally until such time as all principal on the notes had been paid in full. Once the notes in such transactions were paid in full, the remaining unencumbered student loans (and other remaining assets, if any) in the securitization would be released to the Company, at which time the Company would have the option to refinance or sell these assets, or retain them on the balance sheet as unencumbered assets.\nDuring 2019, the Company extinguished a total of $1.05 billion of notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations, including six of the Company's eight Turbo Transactions, prior to the notes' contractual maturities, resulting in the release of $1.45 billion in student loans and accrued interest receivable that were previously encumbered in the asset-backed securitizations. Upon extinguishment of the notes payable throughout 2019, the Company refinanced the student loans in its FFELP warehouse facilities and new asset-backed securitizations, resulting in net cash proceeds of $387.1 million.\nThe cash proceeds generated by the debt extinguishments were used to pay down a significant portion of the outstanding balance on the Company's unsecured line of credit and provides the Company with increased liquidity and the opportunity to invest the previously underutilized capital at higher returns.\n\u2022In 2019, the Company obtained a consumer loan warehouse facility with an aggregate maximum financing amount available of $200.0 million and a final maturity date of April 23, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, $116.6 million was outstanding under this facility and $83.4 million was available for future funding.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed seven FFELP asset-backed securitizations totaling $2.8 billion (par value). The proceeds from these transactions were used primarily to refinance student loans included in the Company's FFELP warehouse facilities and unencumbered student loans from the extinguishment of certain asset-backed securitizations.\n\u2022On June 25, 2019, the Company completed a private education loan asset-backed securitization totaling $47.2 million (par value). The proceeds from this transaction were used to refinance private education loans previously funded via a private loan repurchase agreement that was terminated on June 25, 2019.\n\u2022During 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 726,273 shares of Class A common stock for $40.4 million ($55.64 per share).\n\u2022On May 8, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to a total of five million shares of the Company's Class A common stock during the three-year period ending May 7, 2022. As of\nDecember 31, 2019, 4.8 million shares remained authorized for repurchase under the Company's stock repurchase program.\n\u2022During 2019, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $29.5 million ($0.74 per share).\n\u2022The Company intends to use its liquidity position to capitalize on market opportunities, including FFELP, private education, and consumer loan acquisitions; strategic acquisitions and investments; expansion of ALLO's telecommunications network; and capital management initiatives, including stock repurchases, debt repurchases, and dividend distributions. The timing and size of these opportunities will vary and will have a direct impact on the Company's cash and investment balances.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAn analysis of the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 is provided below.\nThe Company's operating results are primarily driven by the performance of its existing loan portfolio and the revenues generated by its fee-based businesses and the costs to provide such services. The performance of the Company's portfolio is driven by net interest income (which includes financing costs) and losses related to credit quality of the assets, along with the cost to administer and service the assets and related debt.\nThe Company operates as distinct reportable operating segments as described above. For a reconciliation of the reportable segment operating results to the consolidated results of operations, see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Derivative accounting requires that net settlements with respect to derivatives that do not qualify for \"hedge treatment\" under GAAP be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. The Company maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility. As such, management believes derivative settlements for each applicable period should be evaluated with the Company's net interest income as presented in the table below. Net interest income (net of settlements on derivatives) is a non-GAAP financial measure, and the Company reports this non-GAAP information because the Company believes that it provides additional information regarding operational and performance indicators that are closely assessed by management. There is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for the presentation of such non-GAAP information, which is only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information that management utilizes to assess performance. See note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the Company's derivative instruments, including the net settlement activity recognized by the Company for each type of derivative for the 2019 and 2018 periods presented in the table under the caption \"Income Statement Impact\" in note 5 and in the table below.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Additional information </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable loan interest margin\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>174,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Represents the yield the Company receives on its loan portfolio less the cost of funding these loans.

The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to twelve months of revenue under this contract in 2019 as compared to approximately eleven months of revenue (from the Great Lakes acquisition date) in 2018. Amount also includes revenue earned from marketing services provided to existing clients, which increased in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of an increase in marketing services provided to such clients.\n(c) The Company provides investment advisory services through Whitetail Rock Capital Management, LLC (\"WRCM\"), the Company's SEC-registered investment advisor subsidiary, under various arrangements. WRCM earns annual fees of 25 basis points on the majority of the outstanding balance of asset-backed securities under management and up to 50 percent of the gains from the sale of asset-backed securities or asset-backed securities being called prior to the full contractual maturity for which it provides advisory services. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of asset-backed securities under management subject to these arrangements was $983.0 million. In addition, WRCM earns annual management fees of five basis points for certain other investments under management. The decrease in advisory fees in 2019 as compared to 2018 was the result of a decrease in performance fees earned.\nLOAN SERVICING AND SYSTEMS OPERATING SEGMENT - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company purchased Great Lakes on February 7, 2018.

Higher amounts of revenue are typically recognized during the first quarter due to fees related to grant and aid applications as well as online applications and enrollment services. The Company's operating expenses do not follow the seasonality of the revenues. This is primarily due to generally fixed year-round personnel costs and seasonal marketing costs. Based on the timing of revenue recognition and when expenses are incurred, revenue and pre-tax operating margin are higher in the first quarter as compared to the remainder of the year.\nOn November 20, 2018, the Company acquired TMS, a services company that offers tuition payment plans, billing services, payment technology solutions, and refund management to educational institutions.

In 2016 and 2017, the outstanding amount owed by ALLO to Nelnet, Inc. and the related interest expense incurred by ALLO and the interest income recognized by Nelnet, Inc. under the line of credit was eliminated in the Company's consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2018, Nelnet, Inc. contributed equity to ALLO with an associated guaranteed payment and ALLO used the proceeds from this capital contribution to pay off all of the outstanding balance on the line of credit, including all accrued and unpaid interest. For financial reporting purposes, the guaranteed payment recorded by ALLO was classified as debt and such debt and the guaranteed return paid to Nelnet, Inc. (reflected as interest expense for ALLO) was eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. On October 1, 2018, the guaranteed payment was replaced with a yield-based preferred return of future earnings on the contributed equity. For financial reporting purposes, the preferred interest recorded by ALLO is classified as equity and the preferred return on the preferred interest is not treated by ALLO as interest expense. Accordingly, subsequent to October 1, 2018, ALLO will not report interest expense in its income statement related to amounts contributed to ALLO from Nelnet, Inc.\nCertain financial and operating data

(loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure that is frequently used in capital-intensive industries such as telecommunications. ALLO's management uses EBITDA to compare ALLO's performance to that of its competitors and to eliminate certain non-cash and non-operating items in order to consistently measure performance from period to period. EBITDA excludes interest and income taxes because these items are associated with a company's particular capitalization and tax structures. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non-cash expenses primarily reflect the impact of historical capital investments, as opposed to the cash impacts of capital expenditures made in recent periods, which may be evaluated through cash flow measures. The Company reports EBITDA for ALLO because the Company believes that it provides useful additional information for investors regarding a key metric used by management to assess ALLO's performance. There are limitations to using EBITDA as a performance measure, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ALLO's calculations. In addition, EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance, such as net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of EBITDA from net income (loss) under GAAP is presented under \"Summary and Comparison of Operating Results\" in the table above.\n(b) Represents the number of single residence homes, apartments, and condominiums that ALLO already serves and those in which ALLO has the capacity to connect to its network distribution system without further material extensions to the transmission lines, but have not been connected.\n(c) During the third quarter of 2018, ALLO began providing services in Fort Morgan, Colorado. During the fourth quarter of 2018, ALLO began providing services in Hastings, Nebraska. During the second quarter of 2019, ALLO announced plans to expand its network to make services available in Breckenridge, Colorado. During the fourth quarter of 2019, ALLO announced plans to expand its network to make services available in Imperial, Nebraska. ALLO is now in eleven communities, including nine in Nebraska and two in Colorado.\nASSET GENERATION AND MANAGEMENT OPERATING SEGMENT - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLoan Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had a $20.7 billion loan portfolio, consisting primarily of federally insured loans, that management anticipates will amortize over the next approximately 20 years and has a weighted average remaining life of 8.8 years.

Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact the Company's earnings through increased servicing and collection costs and account charge-offs.\nFor a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses for 2019 and 2018, and a summary of the Company's loan delinquency amounts as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nProvision for loan losses for federally insured loans was $8.0 million and $14.0 million, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2018, the Company determined an additional allowance was necessary related to portfolios of federally insured loans that were purchased in prior periods and recognized $5.0 million in provision expense related to such loans.\nThe Company did not record provision expense for private education loans in 2019 and 2018.\nProvision for loan losses for consumer loans was $31.0 million and $9.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the provision in 2019 as compared to 2018 was a result of the increased amount of consumer loan purchases during 2019 as reflected in the \"Loan Activity\" table above.\nLoan Spread Analysis\nThe following table analyzes the loan spread on the Company's portfolio of loans, which represents the spread between the yield earned on loan assets and the costs of the liabilities and derivative instruments used to fund the assets. The spread amounts included in the following table are calculated by using the notional dollar values found in the table under the caption \"Net interest income, net of settlements on derivatives\" below, divided by the average balance of student loans or debt outstanding.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable loan yield, gross </td> <td>4.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidation rebate fees </td> <td>(0.83) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.84) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount accretion, net of premium and deferred origination costs amortization\n</td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable loan yield, net </td> <td>3.99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan cost of funds - interest expense </td> <td>(3.25) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.98) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan cost of funds - derivative settlements (a) (b) </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable loan spread </td> <td>0.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate floor income, gross </td> <td>0.22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate floor income - derivative settlements (a) (c) </td> <td>0.19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate floor income, net of settlements on derivatives </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core loan spread (d) </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average balance of loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,698,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,596,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average balance of debt outstanding </td> <td>21,259,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,181,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA reconciliation of core loan spread, which includes the impact of derivative settlements on loan spread, to loan spread without derivative settlements follows.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core loan spread </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative settlements (1:3 basis swaps) </td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative settlements (fixed rate floor income) </td> <td>(0.19) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.30) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan spread </td> <td>0.96 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.99 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Derivative settlements represent the cash paid or received during the current period to settle with derivative instrument counterparties the economic effect of the Company's derivative instruments based on their contractual terms. Derivative accounting requires that net settlements with respect to derivatives that do not qualify for \"hedge treatment\" under GAAP be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. The Company maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility. As such, management believes derivative settlements for each applicable period should be evaluated with the Company's net interest income (loan spread) as presented in this table. The Company reports this non-GAAP information because it believes that it provides additional information regarding operational and performance indicators that are closely assessed by management. There is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for the presentation of such non-GAAP information, which is only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information that management utilizes to assess performance. See note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the Company's derivative instruments, including the net settlement activity recognized by the Company for each type of derivative for the 2019 and 2018 periods presented in the table under the caption \"Income Statement Impact\" in note 5 and in this table.\n(b) Derivative settlements consist of net settlements received related to the Company's 1:3 basis swaps.\n(c) Derivative settlements consist of net settlements received related to the Company's floor income interest rate swaps.\n(d) Core loan spread, excluding consumer loans, would have been 1.09% and 1.27% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other than consumer loans funded in the Company's consumer loan warehouse facility that was obtained on January 11, 2019, consumer loans were and continue to be funded by the Company using operating cash, until they can be funded in a secured financing transaction. Consumer loans funded with operating cash do not have a cost of funds (debt) associated with them. The average balance of consumer loans outstanding in 2019 and 2018 was $219.1 million, and $90.9 million, respectively. The average balance outstanding on the consumer loan warehouse facility in 2019 was $98.2 million.\nA trend analysis of the Company's core and variable loan spreads by calendar year quarter is summarized below.\n(a) The interest earned on a large portion of the Company's FFELP student loan assets is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate. The Company funds a portion of its assets with three-month LIBOR indexed floating rate securities. The relationship between the indices in which the Company earns interest on its loans and funds such loans has a significant impact on loan spread. This table (the right axis) shows the difference between the Company's liability base rate and the one-month LIBOR rate by quarter. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk,\u201d which provides additional detail on the Company's FFELP student loan assets and related funding for those assets.\nVariable loan spread remained constant for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the impact of the Company's consumer loan portfolio. Variable loan spread without consumer loans was 0.67% and 0.71% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This decrease was due to the widening in the basis between the asset and debt indices in which the Company earns interest on its loans and funds such loans (as reflected in the table above).\nThe difference between variable loan spread and core loan spread is fixed rate floor income earned on a portion of the Company's federally insured student loan portfolio. A summary of fixed rate floor income and its contribution to core loan spread follows:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate floor income, gross </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative settlements (a) </td> <td>40,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate floor income, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed rate floor income contribution to spread, net </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Includes settlement payments on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income.\nThe decrease in gross fixed rate floor income in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to higher interest rates in 2019 as compared to 2018. The Company has a portfolio of derivative instruments in which the Company pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate to economically hedge loans earning fixed rate floor income. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk,\u201d which provides additional detail on the Company's portfolio earning fixed rate floor income and the derivatives used by the Company to hedge these loans.\nSummary and Comparison of Operating Results\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Additional information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income after\nprovision for loan losses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>See table below for additional analysis. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td>30,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>The Company sold two portfolios of consumer loans during 2019 and recognized total gains of $17.3 million.

Derivative accounting requires that net settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for \"hedge treatment\" under GAAP be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. The Company maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility. As such, management believes derivative settlements for each applicable period should be evaluated with the Company's net interest income as presented in this table. Core loan interest income and net interest income after provision for loan losses (net of settlements on derivatives) are non-GAAP financial measures, and the Company reports this non-GAAP information because the Company believes that it provides additional information regarding operational and performance indicators that are closely assessed by management. There is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for the presentation of such non-GAAP information, which is only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information that management utilizes to assess performance. See note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the Company's derivative instruments, including the net settlement activity recognized by the Company for each type of derivative referred to in the \"Additional information\" column of this table, for the 2019 and 2018 periods presented in the table under the caption \"Income Statement Impact\" in note 5 and in this table.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the interest earned on a principal amount of $18.9 billion in the Company's FFELP student loan asset portfolio was indexed to one-month LIBOR, and the interest paid on a principal amount of $18.4 billion of the Company's FFELP student loan asset-backed debt securities was indexed to one-month or three-month LIBOR. In addition, the majority of the Company's derivative financial instrument transactions used to manage LIBOR interest rate risks are indexed to LIBOR. There is significant uncertainty regarding the availability of LIBOR as a benchmark rate after 2021, and any market transition away from the current LIBOR framework could result in significant changes to the interest rate characteristics of the Company's LIBOR-indexed assets and funding for those assets, as well as the Company's LIBOR-indexed derivative instruments. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors - Loan Portfolio - Interest rate risk - replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate.\"\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company's Loan Servicing and Systems and Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing operating segments are non-capital intensive and both produce positive operating cash flows. As such, a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to these segments and any liquidity or capital needs are satisfied using cash flow from operations. Therefore, the Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion is concentrated on the Company's liquidity and capital needs to meet existing debt obligations in the Asset Generation and Management operating segment and capital needs to expand ALLO's communications network in the Company's Communications operating segment.\nThe Company may issue equity and debt securities in the future in order to improve capital, increase liquidity, refinance upcoming maturities, or provide for general corporate purposes. Moreover, the Company may from time-to-time repurchase certain amounts of its outstanding secured and unsecured debt securities, including debt securities which the Company may issue in the future, for cash and/or through exchanges for other securities. Such repurchases or exchanges may be made in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Any such repurchases or exchanges will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, compliance with securities laws, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions may be material.\nThe Company has historically utilized operating cash flow, secured financing transactions (which include warehouse facilities, asset-backed securitizations, and liquidity programs offered by the Department), operating lines of credit, and other borrowing arrangements to fund its Asset Generation and Management operations and loan acquisitions. In addition, the Company has used operating cash flow, borrowings on its unsecured line of credit, repurchase agreements, and unsecured debt offerings to fund corporate activities, business acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, repurchases of its own debt, and expansion of ALLO's fiber network.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe Company has historically generated positive cash flow from operations. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's net cash provided by operating activities was $298.9 million and $270.9 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $133.9 million. The Company also had a portfolio of available-for-sale investments, consisting primarily of student loan asset-backed securities, with a fair value of $52.7 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Company also has a $455.0 million unsecured line of credit that matures on December 16, 2024. As of December 31, 2019, there was $50.0 million outstanding on the unsecured line of credit and $405.0 million was available for future use. The line of credit provides that the Company may increase the aggregate financing commitments, through the existing lenders and/or through new lenders, up to a total of $550.0 million, subject to certain conditions. In addition, on May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a $22.0 million secured line of credit agreement that matures on May 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, the secured line of credit had $5.0 million outstanding with $17.0 million available for future use.\nIn addition, the Company has repurchased certain of its own asset-backed securities (bonds and notes payable) in the secondary market. For accounting purposes, these notes are eliminated in consolidation and are not included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. However, these securities remain legally outstanding at the trust level and the Company could sell these notes to third parties or redeem the notes at par as cash is generated by the trust estate. Upon a sale of these notes to third parties, the Company would obtain cash proceeds equal to the market value of the notes on the date of such sale. As of December 31, 2019, the Company holds $15.0 million (par value) of its own asset-backed securities.\nThe Company intends to use its liquidity position to capitalize on market opportunities, including FFELP, private education, and consumer loan acquisitions; strategic acquisitions and investments; expansion of ALLO's telecommunications network; and capital management initiatives, including stock repurchases, debt repurchases, and dividend distributions. The timing and size of these opportunities will vary and will have a direct impact on the Company's cash and investment balances.\nCash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company generated $298.9 million from operating activities, compared to $270.9 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was due to:\n\u2022The adjustments to net income for derivative market value adjustments; and\n\u2022The impact of changes to accrued interest receivable and other liabilities in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nThese factors were partially offset by:\n\u2022The decrease in net income;\n\u2022Adjustments to net income for the impact of deferred taxes;\n\u2022Net payments to the derivative clearinghouse in 2019 of $70.7 million compared to net proceeds received in 2018 of $40.4 million related to the Company's derivative portfolio;\n\u2022Net payments to derivative counterparties to terminate derivatives in 2019 of $12.5 million compared to net proceeds received in 2018 of $10.3 million; and\n\u2022The impact of changes to accounts receivable and accrued interest payable in 2019 as compared to 2018.\nThe primary items included in the statement of cash flows for investing activities are the purchase and repayment of loans. The primary items included in financing activities are the proceeds from the issuance of and payments on bonds and notes payable used to fund loans. Cash provided by investing activities and used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1,524.6 million and $1,793.3 million, respectively. Cash used in investing activities and provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $732.4 million and $711.8 million, respectively. Investing and financing activities are further addressed in the discussion that follows.\nLiquidity Needs and Sources of Liquidity Available to Satisfy Debt Obligations Secured by Loan Assets and Related Collateral\nThe following table shows the Company's debt obligations outstanding that are secured by loan assets and related collateral:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Carrying amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Final maturity </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bonds and notes issued in asset-backed securitizations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,833,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5/27/25 - 01/25/68 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFELP and consumer loan warehouse facilities </td> <td>894,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5/20/21 - 5/31/22 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,727,799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBonds and Notes Issued in Asset-backed Securitizations\nThe majority of the Company's portfolio of student loans is funded in asset-backed securitizations that are structured to substantially match the maturity of the funded assets, thereby minimizing liquidity risk. Cash generated from student loans funded in asset-backed securitizations provide the sources of liquidity to satisfy all obligations related to the outstanding bonds and notes issued in such securitizations. In addition, due to (i) the difference between the yield the Company receives on the loans and cost of financing within these transactions, and (ii) the servicing and administration fees the Company earns from these transactions, the Company has created a portfolio that will generate earnings and significant cash flow over the life of these transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, based on cash flow models developed to reflect management's current estimate of, among other factors, prepayments, defaults, deferment, forbearance, and interest rates, the Company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its portfolio to be approximately $1.89 billion as detailed below.\nThe forecasted cash flow presented below includes all loans funded in asset-backed securitizations as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $19.7 billion of loans included in asset-backed securitizations, which represented 94.8 percent of its total loan portfolio. The forecasted cash flow does not include cash flows that the Company expects to receive related to loans funded in its warehouse facilities as of December 31, 2019, private education and consumer loans funded with operating cash, and loans acquired subsequent to December 31, 2019.\nThe forecasted future undiscounted cash flows of approximately $1.89 billion include approximately $1.01 billion (as of December 31, 2019) of overcollateralization included in the asset-backed securitizations. These excess net asset positions are reflected variously in the following balances on the consolidated balance sheet: \"loans receivable,\" \"restricted cash,\" and \"accrued interest receivable.\" The difference between the total estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the overcollateralization of approximately $0.88 billion, or approximately $0.67 billion after income taxes based on the estimated effective tax rate, is expected to be accretive to the Company's December 31, 2019 balance of consolidated shareholders' equity.\nTwo of the Company's asset-backed securitizations as of December 31, 2019 are structured as Turbo Transactions\u201d which require all cash generated from the student loans (including excess spread) to be directed toward payment of interest and any outstanding principal generally until such time as all principal on the notes has been paid in full. Once the notes in such transactions are paid in full, the remaining unencumbered student loans (and other remaining assets, if any) in the securitizations will be released to the Company, at which time the Company will have the option to refinance or sell these assets, or retain them on the balance sheet as unencumbered assets.\nThe Company uses various assumptions, including prepayments and future interest rates, when preparing its cash flow forecast. These assumptions are further discussed below.\nPrepayments: The primary variable in establishing a life of loan estimate is the level and timing of prepayments. Prepayment rates equal the amount of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance, net of scheduled principal payments. A number of factors can affect estimated prepayment rates, including the level of consolidation activity, borrower default rates, and utilization of debt management options such as income-based repayment, deferments, and forbearance. Should any of these factors change, management may revise its assumptions, which in turn would impact the projected future cash flow. The Company's cash flow forecast above assumes prepayment rates that are generally consistent with those utilized in the Company's recent asset-backed securitization transactions. If management used a prepayment rate assumption two times greater than what was used to forecast the cash flow, the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately $135 million to $165 million.\nInterest rates: The Company funds a large portion of its student loans with three-month LIBOR indexed floating rate securities. Meanwhile, the interest earned on the Company's student loan assets is indexed primarily to a one-month LIBOR rate. The different interest rate characteristics of the Company's loan assets and liabilities funding these assets result in basis risk. The Company's cash flow forecast assumes three-month LIBOR will exceed one-month LIBOR by 12 basis points for the\nlife of the portfolio, which approximates the historical relationship between these indices. If the forecast is computed assuming a spread of 24 basis points between three-month and one-month LIBOR for the life of the portfolio, the cash flow forecast would be reduced by approximately $75 million to $95 million. As the percentage of the Company's outstanding debt financed by three-month LIBOR declines, the Company's basis risk will be reduced.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the availability of LIBOR as a benchmark rate after 2021, and any market transition away from the current LIBOR framework could result in significant changes to the forecasted cash flows from the Company's asset-backed securitizations. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors - Loan Portfolio - Interest rate risk - replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate.\"\nThe Company uses the current forward interest rate yield curve to forecast cash flows. A change in the forward interest rate curve would impact the future cash flows generated from the portfolio. An increase in future interest rates will reduce the amount of fixed rate floor income the Company is currently receiving. The Company attempts to mitigate the impact of a rise in short-term rates by hedging interest rate risks. The forecasted cash flow does not include cash flows the Company expects to pay/receive related to derivative instruments used by the Company to manage interest rate risk. See Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\"\nExtinguishment of Certain Asset-Backed Securitizations (Including Turbo Transactions)\nDuring 2019, the Company extinguished $1.05 billion of notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations, including six of the Company's eight Turbo Transactions (prior to the notes' contractual maturities). These transactions resulted in the release of $1.45 billion in student loans and accrued interest receivable that were previously encumbered in the asset-backed securitizations. To extinguish the notes, the Company paid premiums of $14.0 million and wrote off $2.7 million of debt issuance costs associated with these securitizations. In total, the Company recognized $16.7 million in expenses in 2019 to extinguish these notes. Upon extinguishment of the notes payable throughout 2019, the Company refinanced the student loans in its FFELP warehouse facilities and new asset-backed securitizations, resulting in net cash proceeds of $387.1 million.\nThe cash proceeds generated by the debt extinguishments were used to pay down a significant portion of the outstanding balance on the Company's unsecured line of credit and provides the Company with increased liquidity and the opportunity to invest the previously underutilized capital at higher returns.\nWarehouse Facilities\nThe Company funds a portion of its FFELP loan acquisitions using its FFELP warehouse facilities. Student loan warehousing allows the Company to buy and manage student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had two FFELP warehouse facilities with an aggregate maximum financing amount available of $1.1 billion, of which $0.8 billion was outstanding and $0.3 billion was available for additional funding. One warehouse facility has a static advance rate until the expiration date of the liquidity provisions (May 20, 2020). In the event the liquidity provisions are not extended, the valuation agent has the right to perform a one-time mark to market on the underlying loans funded in this facility, subject to a floor. The loans would then be funded at this new advance rate until the final maturity date of the facility (May 20, 2021). The other warehouse facility has a static advance rate that requires initial equity for loan funding and does not require increased equity based on market movements. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $42.6 million advanced as equity support on these facilities. For further discussion of the Company's FFELP warehouse facilities outstanding at December 31, 2019, see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOn January 11, 2019, the Company obtained a consumer loan warehouse facility that has an aggregate maximum financing amount available of $200.0 million, an advance rate of 70 or 75 percent depending on the type of collateral and subject to certain concentration limits, liquidity provisions to April 23, 2021, and a final maturity date of April 23, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, $116.6 million was outstanding under this facility and $83.4 million was available for future funding. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, the Company had $41.3 million advanced as equity support under this facility.\nOn January 31, 2020, the Company sold $124.2 (par value) of consumer loans to an unrelated third party. A portion of such loans were funded in the consumer loan warehouse. After completion of this loan sale, the outstanding balance under the consumer loan warehouse was $61.5 million, $138.5 million was available for future funding, and $1.3 million was advanced as equity support.\nOn February 13, 2020, the Company closed on a private loan warehouse facility with an aggregate maximum financing amount available of $100.0 million, with an additional $100.0 million available at the request of the Company and approval of the lender, an advance rate of 90 percent, liquidity provisions through February 15, 2021, and a final maturity date of February 11, 2022. The Company currently anticipates funding approximately $110 million of private loan assets in this facility.\nUpon termination or expiration of the warehouse facilities, the Company would expect to access the securitization market, obtain replacement warehouse facilities, use operating cash, consider the sale of assets, or transfer collateral to satisfy any remaining obligations.\nOther Uses of Liquidity\nThe Company no longer originates new FFELP loans, but continues to acquire FFELP loan portfolios from third parties and believes additional loan purchase opportunities exist, including opportunities to purchase private education and consumer loans.\nThe Company plans to fund additional loan acquisitions using current cash and investments; using its Union Bank participation agreement (as described below); using its existing warehouse facilities (as described above); increasing the capacity under existing and/or establishing new warehouse facilities; and continuing to access the asset-backed securities market.\nUnion Bank Participation Agreement\nThe Company maintains an agreement with Union Bank, a related party, as trustee for various grantor trusts, under which Union Bank has agreed to purchase from the Company participation interests in student loans. As of December 31, 2019, $749.6 million of loans were subject to outstanding participation interests held by Union Bank, as trustee, under this agreement. The agreement automatically renews annually and is terminable by either party upon five business days' notice. This agreement provides beneficiaries of Union Bank's grantor trusts with access to investments in interests in student loans, while providing liquidity to the Company. The Company can participate loans to Union Bank to the extent of availability under the grantor trusts, up to $900.0 million or an amount in excess of $900.0 million if mutually agreed to by both parties. Loans participated under this agreement have been accounted for by the Company as loan sales. Accordingly, the participation interests sold are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nAsset-backed Securities Transactions\nDuring 2019, the Company completed seven FFELP asset-backed securitizations totaling $2.8 billion (par value). The proceeds from these transactions were used primarily to refinance student loans included in the Company's FFELP warehouse facilities and unencumbered student loans from the extinguishment of certain asset-backed securitizations. On June 25, 2019, the Company completed a private education loan asset-backed securitization totaling $47.2 million (par value). The proceeds from this transaction were used to refinance private education loans previously funded via a private loan repurchase agreement that was terminated on June 25, 2019. See note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on these securitizations.\nDepending on future market conditions, the Company currently anticipates continuing to access the asset-backed securitization market. Such asset-backed securitization transactions would be used to refinance loans included in its warehouse facilities, loans purchased from third parties, and/or student loans in its existing asset-backed securitizations.\nLiquidity Impact Related to Hedging Activities\nThe Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity. By using derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk which could impact its liquidity. Based on the derivative portfolio outstanding as of December 31, 2019, the Company does not currently anticipate any movement in interest rates having a material impact on its capital or liquidity profile, nor does the Company expect that any movement in interest rates would have a material impact on its ability to meet potential collateral deposits with its counterparties and/or make variation margin payments to its third-party clearinghouse. However, if interest rates move materially and negatively impact the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, the replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate has significant adverse impacts on our derivatives, or if the Company enters into additional derivatives for which the fair value becomes negative, the Company could be required to deposit additional collateral with its derivative instrument counterparties and/or make variation margin payments to its third-party clearinghouse. The collateral deposits or variation margin, if significant, could negatively impact the Company's liquidity and capital resources. In addition, clearing rules require the Company to post amounts of liquid collateral when executing new derivative instruments, which could prevent or limit the Company from utilizing additional derivative instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity and risks. See note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the Company's derivative portfolio.\nLiquidity Impact Related to the Communications Operating Segment\nALLO has made significant investments in its communications network and currently provides fiber directly to homes and businesses in communities in Nebraska and Colorado. ALLO plans to continue to increase market share and revenue in its existing markets and is currently evaluating opportunities to expand to other communities in the Midwest. In 2019, ALLO's capital expenditures were $45.0 million. The Company anticipates total ALLO network capital expenditures in 2020 will be approximately $35.0 million to $45.0 million. However, this amount could change based on customer demand for ALLO's services. The Company currently plans to use cash from operating activities and its third-party unsecured line of credit to fund ALLO's capital expenditures, as well as potentially other third-party financing alternatives.\nOther Debt Facilities\nAs discussed above, the Company has a $455.0 million unsecured line of credit with a maturity date of December 16, 2024. As of December 31, 2019, the unsecured line of credit had $50.0 million outstanding and $405.0 million was available for future use. On May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a $22.0 million secured line of credit agreement with a maturity date of May 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, the secured line of credit had $5.0 million outstanding with $17.0 million available for future use. The line of credit is secured by several Company-owned properties. Upon the maturity date of these facilities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain these lines of credit, increase the amount outstanding under the lines, or find alternative funding if necessary.\nThe Company has issued Junior Subordinated Hybrid Securities (the \"Hybrid Securities\") that have a final maturity of September 15, 2061. The Hybrid Securities are unsecured obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $20.4 million of Hybrid Securities that remain outstanding.\nFor further discussion of these debt facilities described above, see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nStock Repurchases\nThe Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to a total of five million shares of the Company's Class A common stock during the three-year period ending May 7, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, 4,803,877 shares remain authorized for purchase under the Company's repurchase program. Shares may be repurchased from time to time depending on various factors, including share prices and other potential uses of liquidity. Shares repurchased by the Company during 2019 and 2018 are shown below. Certain of these repurchases were made pursuant to a trading plan adopted by the Company in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total shares repurchased </td> <td> </td> <td>Purchase price (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Average price of shares repurchased (per share) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td>726,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55.64 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2018 </td> <td>868,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncluded in the shares repurchased during 2019 in the table above are a total of 180,000 shares of Class A common stock the Company purchased on June 17, 2019 from one of the Company's significant shareholders, Shelby J. Butterfield, the widow of Stephen F. Butterfield, the Company's former Vice-Chairman and significant shareholder who passed away in April 2018, and from the Butterfield Family Trust, an estate planning trust for the family of Mr. Butterfield. The shares were purchased at a discount to the closing market price of the Company's Class A common stock as of June 17, 2019, and the transaction was separately approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Immediately prior to the Company's purchase of such shares from Ms. Butterfield and the Butterfield Family Trust, the purchased shares were shares of the Company's Class B common stock that Ms. Butterfield and the Butterfield Family Trust converted to shares of Class A common stock.\nDividends\nDividends of $0.18 per share on the Company's Class A and Class B common stock were paid on March 15, 2019, June 14, 2019, and September 13, 2019, respectively, and a dividend of $0.20 per share was paid on December 13, 2019.\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2020 cash dividend on the Company's Class A and Class B common stock of $0.20 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 13, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2020.\nThe Company currently plans to continue making regular quarterly dividend payments, subject to future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors. In addition, the payment of dividends is subject to the terms of the Company's outstanding Hybrid Securities, which generally provide that if the Company defers interest payments on those securities it cannot pay dividends on its capital stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's contractual obligations were as follows:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 to 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 to 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bonds and notes payable (a) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,803,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>899,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,853,516 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease liabilities </td> <td>38,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,941 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,842,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>911,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,864,457 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Amounts exclude interest as substantially all bonds and notes payable carry variable rates of interest.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had a reserve of $15.9 million for uncertain income tax positions (including the federal benefit received from state positions). This obligation is not included in the above table as the timing and resolution of the income tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nOn an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most \"critical\" - that is, they are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and they require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has identified the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses on loans. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses separately on each of its federally insured, private education, and consumer loan portfolios.\nThe allowance for the federally insured student loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the Company's loan portfolios considering loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status, delinquency status, trends in defaults in the portfolio based on Company and industry data, past experience, trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors, changes to federal student loan programs, current economic conditions, and other relevant qualitative factors.\nIn determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses on the private education and consumer loans, the Company considers several factors including: loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status, delinquency status, type of program, trends in defaults in the portfolio based on Company and industry data, past experience, current economic conditions, and other relevant qualitative factors. The Company places a private education or consumer loan on nonaccrual status when the collection\nof principal and interest is 90 days past due and charges off the loan and accrued interest when the collection of principal and interest is 120 days or 180 days past due, depending on the type of loan program.\nThe allowance for loan losses is made at a specific point in time and based on relevant information as discussed above. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management believes is appropriate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolios. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires numerous estimates made by management. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement. Changes in estimates could significantly affect the Company's recorded balance for the allowance for loan losses.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, which changed the way entities recognize impairment of many financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the asset's remaining life. The estimate of credit losses under the new guidance considers historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. The new guidance provides significant flexibility and permits companies to use judgment in selecting the approach that is most appropriate in their circumstances. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020. Prior to the effective date, the Company used an incurred loss model when calculating its allowance for loan losses.\nThe new guidance will primarily impact the allowance for loan losses related to the Company's federally insured student loans, which represented approximately 97.7 percent of the Company's total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and for which the Company's loss exposure is limited by the applicable federal government guarantee, private education loans, and consumer loans. To calculate the allowance for loan losses, the Company has aggregated loans with similar risk characteristics into homogeneous pools based primarily on loan type and expects to use undiscounted cash flow and remaining life methodologies, which incorporate historical loss rates. The historical loss rates are adjusted for reasonable and supportable economic forecasts over a specific period, then reverting to the historical loss average using a straight line method. The national unemployment rate and the year over year change in gross domestic product are the key macroeconomic factors that are relevant to the Company's loan portfolio. The Company also adjusts the historical loss rates for qualitative factors to bring the allowance for loan losses to the level management believes is appropriate. The Company currently expects the impact upon adoption to increase the allowance for loan losses by $60 million to $80 million, which includes a reclassification of the non-accretable discount balance and premiums related to loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration, and decrease retained earnings, net of tax, by $10 million to $20 million. The Company is in the process of finalizing the review of the loss models, economic forecasts, and qualitative adjustments and the models will be refined as needed. Future allowance for loan loss levels will depend on the characteristics of the Company's loan portfolio, economic conditions and forecasts, and other management judgments.", "summary": "This report discusses the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. All dollars are in thousands, except share data, unless otherwise noted.)\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information that the Company's management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements subject to various risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in \"Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\" and Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" included in this report.\nA discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented below. A discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found in Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2019.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company is a diverse company with a purpose to serve others and a vision to make customers' dreams possible by delivering customer focused products and services. The largest operating businesses engage in loan servicing; education technology, services, and payment processing; and communications. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is net interest income earned on a portfolio of federally insured student loans. The Company also makes investments to further diversify both within and outside of its historical core education-related businesses, including, but not limited to, investments in real estate, early-stage and emerging growth companies, and renewable energy.\nGAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income, Excluding Adjustments\nThe Company prepares its financial statements and presents its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, it also provides additional non-GAAP financial information related to specific items management believes to be important in the evaluation of its operating results and performance. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP net income to net income, excluding derivative market value and foreign currency transaction adjustments, and a discussion of why the Company believes providing this additional information is useful to investors, is provided below.\n\n(a) The tax effects are calculated by multiplying the realized and unrealized derivative market value adjustments by the applicable statutory income tax rate.\n(b) \"Derivative market value adjustments\" includes both the realized portion of gains and losses (corresponding to variation margin received or paid on derivative instruments that are settled daily at a central clearinghouse) and the unrealized portion of gains and losses that are caused by changes in fair values of derivatives which do not qualify for \"hedge treatment\" under GAAP. \"Derivative market value adjustments\" does not include \"derivative settlements\" that represent the cash paid or received during the current period to settle with derivative instrument counterparties the economic effect of the Company's derivative instruments based on their contractual terms.\nThe accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings, with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria is met. Management has structured all of the Company's derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective; however, the Company's derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of derivative instruments is reported in current period earnings with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. Under GAAP, the cumulative net realized and unrealized gain or loss caused by changes in fair values of derivatives in which the Company plans to hold to maturity will equal zero over the life of the contract. However, the net realized and unrealized gain or loss during any given reporting period fluctuates significantly from period to period.\nThe Company believes these point-in-time estimates of asset and liability values related to its derivative instruments that are subject to interest rate fluctuations are subject to volatility mostly due to timing and market factors beyond the control of management, and affect the period-to-period comparability of the results of operations. Accordingly, the Company's management utilizes operating results excluding these items for comparability purposes when making decisions regarding the Company's performance and in presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders, and investors. Consequently, the Company reports this non-GAAP information because the Company believes that it provides additional information regarding operational and performance indicators that are closely assessed by management. There is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for the presentation of such non-GAAP information, which is only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information that management utilizes to assess performance.\nGAAP net income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the following factors:\n\u2022The recognition of a net loss during 2019 as compared to a net gain in 2018 due to changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting;\n\u2022The recognition of $16.7 million ($12.7 million after tax) of expenses during 2019 to extinguish notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations prior to the notes' contractual maturities;\n\u2022The decrease in the average balance of loans due to the amortization of the FFELP loan portfolio;\n\u2022The decrease in loan spread on the Company's loan portfolio and related derivative settlements; and\n\u2022The increase in the provision for loan losses related to the Company's growing portfolio of consumer loans.\nThese factors were partially offset by the following items:\n\u2022The contribution to net income from the Company's Loan Servicing and Systems and Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing operating segments; and\n\u2022The recognition of a $17.3 million ($13.1 million after tax) gain from the sale of consumer loans in 2019.\nOperating Results\nThe Company earns net interest income on its loan portfolio, consisting primarily of FFELP loans, in its Asset Generation and Management (\"AGM\") operating segment. This segment is expected to generate a stable net interest margin and significant amounts of cash as the FFELP portfolio amortizes. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a $20.7 billion loan portfolio that management anticipates will amortize over the next approximately 20 years and has a weighted average remaining life of 8.8 years. The Company actively works to maximize the amount and timing of cash flows generated by its FFELP portfolio and seeks to acquire additional loan assets to leverage its servicing scale and expertise to generate incremental earnings and cash flow. However, due to the continued amortization of the Company's FFELP loan portfolio, over time, the Company's net income generated by the AGM segment will continue to decrease. The Company currently believes that in the short-term it will most likely not be able to invest the excess cash generated from the FFELP loan portfolio into assets that immediately generate the rates of return historically realized from that portfolio.\nIn addition, the Company earns fee-based revenue through the following reportable operating segments:\n\u2022Loan Servicing and Systems (\"LSS\") - referred to as Nelnet Diversified Services (\"NDS\")\n\u2022Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing (\"ETS&PP\") - referred to as Nelnet Business Services (\"NBS\")\n\u2022Communications - referred to as ALLO Communications (\"ALLO\")\nOther business activities and operating segments that are not reportable are combined and included in Corporate and Other Activities (\"Corporate\"). Corporate and Other Activities also includes income earned on certain investments and interest expense incurred on unsecured debt transactions.\nThe information below provides the operating results for each reportable operating segment and Corporate and Other Activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions). See \"Results of Operations\" for each reportable operating segment under this Item 7 for additional detail.\n(a) Revenue includes intersegment revenue earned by LSS as a result of servicing loans for AGM.\n(b) Total revenue includes \"net interest income\" and \"total other income\" from the Company's segment statements of income, excluding the impact from changes in fair values of derivatives. Net income excludes changes in fair values of derivatives, net of tax. For information regarding the exclusion of the impact from changes in fair values of derivatives adjustments, see \"GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income, Excluding Adjustments\" above.\nCertain events and transactions from 2019 and 2018, which have impacted or will impact the operating results of the Company and its operating segments, are discussed below.\nLoan Servicing and Systems\n\u2022On February 7, 2018, the Company acquired Great Lakes. The operating results of Great Lakes are reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Thus, there are twelve months of Great Lakes' operations included in 2019 as compared to approximately eleven months of activity in 2018.\n\u2022Nelnet Servicing, LLC (\"Nelnet Servicing\") and Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, Inc. (\"Great Lakes\") have student loan servicing contracts awarded by the Department in June 2009 to provide servicing for loans owned by the Department. As of December 31, 2019, Nelnet Servicing was servicing $183.8 billion of student loans for 5.6 million borrowers under its contract, and Great Lakes was servicing $240.0 billion of student loans for 7.4 million borrowers under its contract.\nNelnet Servicing and Great Lakes' servicing contracts with the Department previously provided for expiration on June 16, 2019. On May 15, 2019, Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes each received a contract extension from the Department's Office of Federal Student Aid (\"FSA\") pursuant to which FSA extended the expiration date of the current contracts to December 15, 2019. On November 26, 2019, Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes each received an additional extension from FSA on their contracts through December 14, 2020. The contract extensions also provide the potential for two additional six-month extensions at the Department's discretion through December 14, 2021.\nFSA is conducting a contract procurement process entitled Next Generation Financial Services Environment ( NextGen\u201d) for a new framework for the servicing of all student loans owned by the Department. On January 15, 2019, FSA issued solicitations for three NextGen components:\n\u2022NextGen Enhanced Processing Solution (\"EPS\")\n\u2022NextGen Business Process Operations (\"BPO\")\n\u2022NextGen Optimal Processing Solution (\"OPS\")\nOn April 1, 2019 and October 4, 2019, the Company responded to the EPS component. On January 16, 2020, FSA released an amendment to the EPS component and the Company responded on February 3, 2020. In addition, on August 1, 2019, the Company responded to the BPO component. On January 10, 2020, FSA released an amendment to the BPO component and the Company responded on January 30, 2020. The Company is also part of a team that has\nresponded and intends to respond to various aspects of the OPS component; however, on November 12, 2019, FSA put an indefinite hold on the OPS solicitation. The EPS and BPO components are essentially for the loan processing and servicing to be performed on a new single system, which the Company believes could have the most significant potential impact on the Company. The Company cannot predict the timing, nature, or outcome of these solicitations.\n\u2022The Loan Servicing and Systems segment will incur additional costs in 2020 to meet increased service and security standards under the current Department servicing contracts and to be responsive to the Department's procurement. As a result, the Company currently expects a significant decrease in this segment's operating margin and net income in 2020 from recent historical results.\nEducation Technology, Services, and Payment Processing\n\u2022On November 20, 2018, the Company acquired Tuition Management Systems (\"TMS\"), a services company that offers tuition payment plans, billing services, payment technology solutions, and refund management to educational institutions. The TMS acquisition added 380 higher education schools and 170 K-12 schools to the Company's customer base. The results of TMS' operations are reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, before tax operating margin (income before income taxes divided by net revenue) was 31.8 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively. The increase in the before tax operating margin in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to operating leverage and cost reductions resulting from the Company's decision in October 2018 to terminate its investment in a proprietary payment processing platform.\nCommunications\n\u2022ALLO recognized losses of $23.5 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in ALLO's net loss in 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense. ALLO recognized $10.0 million of interest expense to Nelnet, Inc. (parent company) during the year ended December 31, 2018. Subsequent to October 1, 2018, ALLO will not report interest expense in its income statement related to amounts contributed to ALLO from Nelnet, Inc. due to a recapitalization of ALLO. Excluding interest expense, the increase in ALLO's net loss in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to an increase in depreciation from significant property and equipment purchases over the last several years to support the Lincoln, Nebraska network build-out that was substantially completed in 2019.\n\u2022ALLO's management uses earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") to eliminate certain non-cash and non-operating items in order to consistently measure performance from period to period. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, ALLO had positive EBITDA of $6.2 million and negative EBITDA of $4.5 million, respectively. EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure which the Company believes provides useful additional information regarding a key metric used by management to assess ALLO's performance. See \"Communications Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Summary and Comparison of Operating Results\" below for additional information regarding the computation and use of EBITDA for ALLO.\n\u2022ALLO has made significant investments in its communications network and currently provides fiber directly to homes and businesses in communities in Nebraska and Colorado. ALLO plans to continue to increase market share and revenue in its existing markets and is currently evaluating opportunities to expand to other communities in the Midwest. ALLO began providing services in Lincoln, Nebraska in September 2016 as part of a multi-year project to pass substantially all commercial and residential properties in the community. As of the end of the first quarter of 2019, the build-out of the Lincoln community was substantially complete. For the year ended December 31, 2019, ALLO's capital expenditures were $45.0 million. The Company anticipates total ALLO network capital expenditures in 2020 will be approximately $35.0 million to $45.0 million. However, this amount could change based on customer demand for ALLO's services.\n\u2022The Company currently anticipates ALLO's operating results will be dilutive to the Company's consolidated earnings as it continues to develop and add customers to its network in Lincoln, Nebraska and other communities, due to large upfront capital expenditures and associated depreciation and upfront customer acquisition costs.\nAsset Generation and Management\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2019, the AGM segment recognized net interest income of $238.6 million, compared with $249.1 million in 2018. The Company maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility. The AGM segment recognized income from derivative settlements of $45.4 million in 2019, compared with income of $70.5 million in 2018. Derivative settlements for each applicable period should be evaluated with the Company's net interest income. Net interest income and derivative settlements for the AGM segment totaled $284.0 million and $319.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022The Company's average balance of loans decreased to $21.7 billion in 2019, compared with $22.6 billion in 2018. Loan spread decreased to 0.96 percent in 2019, compared with 0.99 percent in 2018. Core loan spread, which includes the impact of derivative settlements, decreased to 1.18 percent in 2019, compared with 1.32 percent in 2018. Core loan spread, a non-GAAP measure, is computed as set forth in \"Asset Generation and Management Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Loan Spread Analysis\" below. Management believes core loan spread is a useful supplemental non-GAAP measure that reflects adjustments for derivative settlements related to net interest income (loan spread). However, there is no comprehensive authoritative guidance for the presentation of this measure, which is only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information that management utilizes to assess performance.\nThe Company recognized $89.9 million and $121.7 million in fixed rate floor income in 2019 and 2018, respectively (which includes $40.2 million and $64.9 million, respectively, of settlement payments received on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income). Fixed rate floor income contributed 41 basis points and 55 basis points of core loan spread in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross fixed rate floor income was due to higher interest rates in 2019 as compared to 2018, and the decrease in derivative settlement payments received on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income was due to a decrease in the notional amount of derivatives outstanding in 2019 as compared to 2018, partially offset by higher interest rates.\n\u2022Provision for loan losses was $39.0 million and $23.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nProvision for loan losses for federally insured loans was $8.0 million and $14.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2018, the Company determined an additional allowance was necessary related to portfolios of federally insured loans that were purchased in prior periods, and recognized $5.0 million in provision expense related to these loans.\nProvision for loan losses for consumer loans was $31.0 million and $9.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in provision was a result of the increased amount of consumer loan purchases during 2019. The Company purchased $405.7 million of consumer loans during 2019 compared to $120.5 million during 2018.\n\u2022The Company recognized $16.7 million (pre-tax) of expenses in 2019 related to the extinguishment of notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations prior to the notes' contractual maturities (as further described below). These expenses consisted of premium payments made by the Company of $14.0 million and the write-off of $2.7 million of debt issuance costs.\n\u2022During 2019, the Company sold $227.0 million (par value) of consumer loans to an unrelated third party who securitized such loans. As partial consideration received for the consumer loans sold, the Company received a percentage interest of the residual interest of the consumer loan securitizations. The Company recognized a gain of $17.3 million (pre-tax) from the sale of these loans.\nCorporate and Other Activities\n\u2022The Company adopted a new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. The most significant impact of the standard to the Company relates to (1) the recognition of new right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet primarily for office, data center, and dark fiber operating leases; (2) the deconsolidation of assets and liabilities for certain sale-leaseback transactions arising from build-to-suit lease arrangements for which construction was completed and the Company is leasing the constructed assets that did not qualify for sale accounting prior to the adoption of the new standard; and (3) significant new disclosures about the Company's leasing activities.\nAdoption of the new standard resulted in recognizing lease liabilities of $33.7 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments. In addition, the Company recognized ROU assets of $32.8 million, which corresponds to the lease liabilities reduced by deferred rent expense as of the effective date. The Company also deconsolidated total assets of $43.8 million and total liabilities of $34.8 million for entities that had been consolidated\ndue to sale-leaseback transactions that failed to qualify for recognition as sales under the prior guidance. Deconsolidation of these entities reduced noncontrolling interests by $6.1 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $133.9 million. In addition, the Company had a portfolio of available-for-sale investments, consisting primarily of student loan asset-backed securities, with a fair value of $52.7 million as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022The Company has historically generated positive cash flow from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's net cash provided by operating activities was $298.9 million.\n\u2022On December 16, 2019, the Company amended its unsecured line of credit to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the facility from June 22, 2023 to December 16, 2024 and increase the size of the facility from $382.5 million to $455.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the unsecured line of credit had $50.0 million outstanding and $405.0 million was available for future use. The line of credit provides that the Company may increase the aggregate financing commitments, through the existing lenders and/or through new lenders, up to a total of $550.0 million, subject to certain conditions.\n\u2022The majority of the Company's portfolio of student loans is funded in asset-backed securitizations that will generate significant earnings and cash flow over the life of these transactions. As of December 31, 2019, the Company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its securitization portfolio to be approximately $1.89 billion, of which approximately $1.28 billion will be generated over the next six years.\n\u2022Certain of the Company's asset-backed securitizations were structured as Turbo Transactions\u201d which required all cash generated from the student loans (including excess spread) to be directed toward payment of interest and any outstanding principal generally until such time as all principal on the notes had been paid in full. Once the notes in such transactions were paid in full, the remaining unencumbered student loans (and other remaining assets, if any) in the securitization would be released to the Company, at which time the Company would have the option to refinance or sell these assets, or retain them on the balance sheet as unencumbered assets.\nDuring 2019, the Company extinguished a total of $1.05 billion of notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations, including six of the Company's eight Turbo Transactions, prior to the notes' contractual maturities, resulting in the release of $1.45 billion in student loans and accrued interest receivable that were previously encumbered in the asset-backed securitizations. Upon extinguishment of the notes payable throughout 2019, the Company refinanced the student loans in its FFELP warehouse facilities and new asset-backed securitizations, resulting in net cash proceeds of $387.1 million.\nThe cash proceeds generated by the debt extinguishments were used to pay down a significant portion of the outstanding balance on the Company's unsecured line of credit and provides the Company with increased liquidity and the opportunity to invest the previously underutilized capital at higher returns.\n\u2022In 2019, the Company obtained a consumer loan warehouse facility with an aggregate maximum financing amount available of $200.0 million and a final maturity date of April 23, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, $116.6 million was outstanding under this facility and $83.4 million was available for future funding.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed seven FFELP asset-backed securitizations totaling $2.8 billion (par value). The proceeds from these transactions were used primarily to refinance student loans included in the Company's FFELP warehouse facilities and unencumbered student loans from the extinguishment of certain asset-backed securitizations.\n\u2022On June 25, 2019, the Company completed a private education loan asset-backed securitization totaling $47.2 million (par value). The proceeds from this transaction were used to refinance private education loans previously funded via a private loan repurchase agreement that was terminated on June 25, 2019.\n\u2022During 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 726,273 shares of Class A common stock for $40.4 million ($55.64 per share).\n\u2022On May 8, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to a total of five million shares of the Company's Class A common stock during the three-year period ending May 7, 2022. As of\nDecember 31, 2019, 4.8 million shares remained authorized for repurchase under the Company's stock repurchase program.\n\u2022During 2019, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $29.5 million ($0.74 per share).\n\u2022The Company intends to use its liquidity position to capitalize on market opportunities, including FFELP, private education, and consumer loan acquisitions; strategic acquisitions and investments; expansion of ALLO's telecommunications network; and capital management initiatives, including stock repurchases, debt repurchases, and dividend distributions. The timing and size of these opportunities will vary and will have a direct impact on the Company's cash and investment balances.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAn analysis of the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 is provided below.\nThe Company's operating results are primarily driven by the performance of its existing loan portfolio and the revenues generated by its fee-based businesses and the costs to provide such services. The performance of the Company's portfolio is driven by net interest income (which includes financing costs) and losses related to credit quality of the assets, along with the cost to administer and service the assets and related debt.\nThe Company operates as distinct reportable operating segments as described above. For a reconciliation of the reportable segment operating results to the consolidated results of operations, see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report. Since the Company monitors and assesses its operations and results based on these segments, the discussion following the consolidated results of operations is presented on a reportable segment basis.\n Year ended December 31, 2019 2018 Additional information Loan interest $ 914,256 897,666 Increase was due primarily to an increase in the gross yield earned on loans, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of loans and a decrease in gross fixed rate floor income due to higher interest rates in 2019 as compared to 2018. Investment interest 34,421 26,600 Includes income from unrestricted interest-earning deposits and investments and funds in asset-backed securitizations. Increase was due to increases in interest-earning investments and interest rates. Total interest income 948,677 924,266 Interest expense 699,327 669,906 Increase was due to an increase in cost of funds, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of debt outstanding.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. All dollars are in thousands, except share data, unless otherwise noted.)\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information that the Company's management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements subject to various risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in \"Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\" and Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" included in this report.\nA discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented below. A discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found in Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2019.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company is a diverse company with a purpose to serve others and a vision to make customers' dreams possible by delivering customer focused products and services. The largest operating businesses engage in loan servicing; education technology, services, and payment processing; and communications. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is net interest income earned on a portfolio of federally insured student loans. The Company also makes investments to further diversify both within and outside of its historical core education-related businesses, including, but not limited to, investments in real estate, early-stage and emerging growth companies, and renewable energy.\nGAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income, Excluding Adjustments\nThe Company prepares its financial statements and presents its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, it also provides additional non-GAAP financial information related to specific items management believes to be important in the evaluation of its operating results and performance. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP net income to net income, excluding derivative market value and foreign currency transaction adjustments, and a discussion of why the Company believes providing this additional information is useful to investors, is provided below.\nTable 9: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income attributable to Nelnet, Inc.\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>141,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized derivative market value adjustments\n</td> <td>76,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,014) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect (a)\n</td> <td>(18,287) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Nelnet, Inc., excluding derivative market value adjustments (b)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net income attributable to Nelnet, Inc.\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized derivative market value adjustments\n</td> <td>1.90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.02) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect (a)\n</td> <td>(0.45) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Nelnet, Inc., excluding derivative market value adjustments (b)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.99 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) The tax effects are calculated by multiplying the realized and unrealized derivative market value adjustments by the applicable statutory income tax rate.\n(b) \"Derivative market value adjustments\" includes both the realized portion of gains and losses (corresponding to variation margin received or paid on derivative instruments that are settled daily at a central clearinghouse) and the unrealized portion of gains and losses that are caused by changes in fair values of derivatives which do not qualify for \"hedge treatment\" under GAAP. \"Derivative market value adjustments\" does not include \"derivative settlements\" that represent the cash paid or received during the current period to settle with derivative instrument counterparties the economic effect of the Company's derivative instruments based on their contractual terms.\nThe accounting for derivatives requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings, with no fair value adjustment of the hedged item, unless specific hedge accounting criteria is met. Management has structured all of the Company's derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective; however, the Company's derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of derivative instruments is reported in current period earnings with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. Under GAAP, the cumulative net realized and unrealized gain or loss caused by changes in fair values of derivatives in which the Company plans to hold to maturity will equal zero over the life of the contract. However, the net realized and unrealized gain or loss during any given reporting period fluctuates significantly from period to period.\nThe Company believes these point-in-time estimates of asset and liability values related to its derivative instruments that are subject to interest rate fluctuations are subject to volatility mostly due to timing and market factors beyond the control of management, and affect the period-to-period comparability of the results of operations. Accordingly, the Company's management utilizes operating results excluding these items for comparability purposes when making decisions regarding the Company's performance and in presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders, and investors. Consequently, the Company reports this non-GAAP information because the Company believes that it provides additional information regarding operational and performance indicators that are closely assessed by management. There is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for the presentation of such non-GAAP information, which is only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information that management utilizes to assess performance.\nGAAP net income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the following factors:\n\u2022The recognition of a net loss during 2019 as compared to a net gain in 2018 due to changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting;\n\u2022The recognition of $16.7 million ($12.7 million after tax) of expenses during 2019 to extinguish notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations prior to the notes' contractual maturities;\n\u2022The decrease in the average balance of loans due to the amortization of the FFELP loan portfolio;\n\u2022The decrease in loan spread on the Company's loan portfolio and related derivative settlements; and\n\u2022The increase in the provision for loan losses related to the Company's growing portfolio of consumer loans.\nThese factors were partially offset by the following items:\n\u2022The contribution to net income from the Company's Loan Servicing and Systems and Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing operating segments; and\n\u2022The recognition of a $17.3 million ($13.1 million after tax) gain from the sale of consumer loans in 2019.\nOperating Results\nThe Company earns net interest income on its loan portfolio, consisting primarily of FFELP loans, in its Asset Generation and Management (\"AGM\") operating segment. This segment is expected to generate a stable net interest margin and significant amounts of cash as the FFELP portfolio amortizes. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a $20.7 billion loan portfolio that management anticipates will amortize over the next approximately 20 years and has a weighted average remaining life of 8.8 years. The Company actively works to maximize the amount and timing of cash flows generated by its FFELP portfolio and seeks to acquire additional loan assets to leverage its servicing scale and expertise to generate incremental earnings and cash flow. However, due to the continued amortization of the Company's FFELP loan portfolio, over time, the Company's net income generated by the AGM segment will continue to decrease. The Company currently believes that in the short-term it will most likely not be able to invest the excess cash generated from the FFELP loan portfolio into assets that immediately generate the rates of return historically realized from that portfolio.\nIn addition, the Company earns fee-based revenue through the following reportable operating segments:\n\u2022Loan Servicing and Systems (\"LSS\") - referred to as Nelnet Diversified Services (\"NDS\")\n\u2022Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing (\"ETS&PP\") - referred to as Nelnet Business Services (\"NBS\")\n\u2022Communications - referred to as ALLO Communications (\"ALLO\")\nOther business activities and operating segments that are not reportable are combined and included in Corporate and Other Activities (\"Corporate\"). Corporate and Other Activities also includes income earned on certain investments and interest expense incurred on unsecured debt transactions.\nThe information below provides the operating results for each reportable operating segment and Corporate and Other Activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions). See \"Results of Operations\" for each reportable operating segment under this Item 7 for additional detail.\n(a) Revenue includes intersegment revenue earned by LSS as a result of servicing loans for AGM.\n(b) Total revenue includes \"net interest income\" and \"total other income\" from the Company's segment statements of income, excluding the impact from changes in fair values of derivatives. Net income excludes changes in fair values of derivatives, net of tax. For information regarding the exclusion of the impact from changes in fair values of derivatives adjustments, see \"GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income, Excluding Adjustments\" above.\nCertain events and transactions from 2019 and 2018, which have impacted or will impact the operating results of the Company and its operating segments, are discussed below.\nLoan Servicing and Systems\n\u2022On February 7, 2018, the Company acquired Great Lakes. The operating results of Great Lakes are reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Thus, there are twelve months of Great Lakes' operations included in 2019 as compared to approximately eleven months of activity in 2018.\n\u2022Nelnet Servicing, LLC (\"Nelnet Servicing\") and Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, Inc. (\"Great Lakes\") have student loan servicing contracts awarded by the Department in June 2009 to provide servicing for loans owned by the Department. As of December 31, 2019, Nelnet Servicing was servicing $183.8 billion of student loans for 5.6 million borrowers under its contract, and Great Lakes was servicing $240.0 billion of student loans for 7.4 million borrowers under its contract.\nNelnet Servicing and Great Lakes' servicing contracts with the Department previously provided for expiration on June 16, 2019. On May 15, 2019, Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes each received a contract extension from the Department's Office of Federal Student Aid (\"FSA\") pursuant to which FSA extended the expiration date of the current contracts to December 15, 2019. On November 26, 2019, Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes each received an additional extension from FSA on their contracts through December 14, 2020. The contract extensions also provide the potential for two additional six-month extensions at the Department's discretion through December 14, 2021.\nFSA is conducting a contract procurement process entitled Next Generation Financial Services Environment ( NextGen\u201d) for a new framework for the servicing of all student loans owned by the Department. On January 15, 2019, FSA issued solicitations for three NextGen components:\n\u2022NextGen Enhanced Processing Solution (\"EPS\")\n\u2022NextGen Business Process Operations (\"BPO\")\n\u2022NextGen Optimal Processing Solution (\"OPS\")\nOn April 1, 2019 and October 4, 2019, the Company responded to the EPS component. On January 16, 2020, FSA released an amendment to the EPS component and the Company responded on February 3, 2020. In addition, on August 1, 2019, the Company responded to the BPO component. On January 10, 2020, FSA released an amendment to the BPO component and the Company responded on January 30, 2020. The Company is also part of a team that has\nresponded and intends to respond to various aspects of the OPS component; however, on November 12, 2019, FSA put an indefinite hold on the OPS solicitation. The EPS and BPO components are essentially for the loan processing and servicing to be performed on a new single system, which the Company believes could have the most significant potential impact on the Company. The Company cannot predict the timing, nature, or outcome of these solicitations.\n\u2022The Loan Servicing and Systems segment will incur additional costs in 2020 to meet increased service and security standards under the current Department servicing contracts and to be responsive to the Department's procurement. As a result, the Company currently expects a significant decrease in this segment's operating margin and net income in 2020 from recent historical results.\nEducation Technology, Services, and Payment Processing\n\u2022On November 20, 2018, the Company acquired Tuition Management Systems (\"TMS\"), a services company that offers tuition payment plans, billing services, payment technology solutions, and refund management to educational institutions. The TMS acquisition added 380 higher education schools and 170 K-12 schools to the Company's customer base. The results of TMS' operations are reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, before tax operating margin (income before income taxes divided by net revenue) was 31.8 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively. The increase in the before tax operating margin in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to operating leverage and cost reductions resulting from the Company's decision in October 2018 to terminate its investment in a proprietary payment processing platform.\nCommunications\n\u2022ALLO recognized losses of $23.5 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in ALLO's net loss in 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense. ALLO recognized $10.0 million of interest expense to Nelnet, Inc. (parent company) during the year ended December 31, 2018. Subsequent to October 1, 2018, ALLO will not report interest expense in its income statement related to amounts contributed to ALLO from Nelnet, Inc. due to a recapitalization of ALLO. Excluding interest expense, the increase in ALLO's net loss in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to an increase in depreciation from significant property and equipment purchases over the last several years to support the Lincoln, Nebraska network build-out that was substantially completed in 2019.\n\u2022ALLO's management uses earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") to eliminate certain non-cash and non-operating items in order to consistently measure performance from period to period. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, ALLO had positive EBITDA of $6.2 million and negative EBITDA of $4.5 million, respectively. EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure which the Company believes provides useful additional information regarding a key metric used by management to assess ALLO's performance. See \"Communications Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Summary and Comparison of Operating Results\" below for additional information regarding the computation and use of EBITDA for ALLO.\n\u2022ALLO has made significant investments in its communications network and currently provides fiber directly to homes and businesses in communities in Nebraska and Colorado. ALLO plans to continue to increase market share and revenue in its existing markets and is currently evaluating opportunities to expand to other communities in the Midwest. ALLO began providing services in Lincoln, Nebraska in September 2016 as part of a multi-year project to pass substantially all commercial and residential properties in the community. As of the end of the first quarter of 2019, the build-out of the Lincoln community was substantially complete. For the year ended December 31, 2019, ALLO's capital expenditures were $45.0 million. The Company anticipates total ALLO network capital expenditures in 2020 will be approximately $35.0 million to $45.0 million. However, this amount could change based on customer demand for ALLO's services.\n\u2022The Company currently anticipates ALLO's operating results will be dilutive to the Company's consolidated earnings as it continues to develop and add customers to its network in Lincoln, Nebraska and other communities, due to large upfront capital expenditures and associated depreciation and upfront customer acquisition costs.\nAsset Generation and Management\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2019, the AGM segment recognized net interest income of $238.6 million, compared with $249.1 million in 2018. The Company maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility. The AGM segment recognized income from derivative settlements of $45.4 million in 2019, compared with income of $70.5 million in 2018. Derivative settlements for each applicable period should be evaluated with the Company's net interest income. Net interest income and derivative settlements for the AGM segment totaled $284.0 million and $319.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022The Company's average balance of loans decreased to $21.7 billion in 2019, compared with $22.6 billion in 2018. Loan spread decreased to 0.96 percent in 2019, compared with 0.99 percent in 2018. Core loan spread, which includes the impact of derivative settlements, decreased to 1.18 percent in 2019, compared with 1.32 percent in 2018. Core loan spread, a non-GAAP measure, is computed as set forth in \"Asset Generation and Management Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Loan Spread Analysis\" below. Management believes core loan spread is a useful supplemental non-GAAP measure that reflects adjustments for derivative settlements related to net interest income (loan spread). However, there is no comprehensive authoritative guidance for the presentation of this measure, which is only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information that management utilizes to assess performance.\nThe Company recognized $89.9 million and $121.7 million in fixed rate floor income in 2019 and 2018, respectively (which includes $40.2 million and $64.9 million, respectively, of settlement payments received on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income). Fixed rate floor income contributed 41 basis points and 55 basis points of core loan spread in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross fixed rate floor income was due to higher interest rates in 2019 as compared to 2018, and the decrease in derivative settlement payments received on derivatives used to hedge student loans earning fixed rate floor income was due to a decrease in the notional amount of derivatives outstanding in 2019 as compared to 2018, partially offset by higher interest rates.\n\u2022Provision for loan losses was $39.0 million and $23.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nProvision for loan losses for federally insured loans was $8.0 million and $14.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2018, the Company determined an additional allowance was necessary related to portfolios of federally insured loans that were purchased in prior periods, and recognized $5.0 million in provision expense related to these loans.\nProvision for loan losses for consumer loans was $31.0 million and $9.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in provision was a result of the increased amount of consumer loan purchases during 2019. The Company purchased $405.7 million of consumer loans during 2019 compared to $120.5 million during 2018.\n\u2022The Company recognized $16.7 million (pre-tax) of expenses in 2019 related to the extinguishment of notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations prior to the notes' contractual maturities (as further described below). These expenses consisted of premium payments made by the Company of $14.0 million and the write-off of $2.7 million of debt issuance costs.\n\u2022During 2019, the Company sold $227.0 million (par value) of consumer loans to an unrelated third party who securitized such loans. As partial consideration received for the consumer loans sold, the Company received a percentage interest of the residual interest of the consumer loan securitizations. The Company recognized a gain of $17.3 million (pre-tax) from the sale of these loans.\nCorporate and Other Activities\n\u2022The Company adopted a new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. The most significant impact of the standard to the Company relates to (1) the recognition of new right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet primarily for office, data center, and dark fiber operating leases; (2) the deconsolidation of assets and liabilities for certain sale-leaseback transactions arising from build-to-suit lease arrangements for which construction was completed and the Company is leasing the constructed assets that did not qualify for sale accounting prior to the adoption of the new standard; and (3) significant new disclosures about the Company's leasing activities.\nAdoption of the new standard resulted in recognizing lease liabilities of $33.7 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments. In addition, the Company recognized ROU assets of $32.8 million, which corresponds to the lease liabilities reduced by deferred rent expense as of the effective date. The Company also deconsolidated total assets of $43.8 million and total liabilities of $34.8 million for entities that had been consolidated\ndue to sale-leaseback transactions that failed to qualify for recognition as sales under the prior guidance. Deconsolidation of these entities reduced noncontrolling interests by $6.1 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $133.9 million. In addition, the Company had a portfolio of available-for-sale investments, consisting primarily of student loan asset-backed securities, with a fair value of $52.7 million as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022The Company has historically generated positive cash flow from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's net cash provided by operating activities was $298.9 million.\n\u2022On December 16, 2019, the Company amended its unsecured line of credit to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the facility from June 22, 2023 to December 16, 2024 and increase the size of the facility from $382.5 million to $455.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the unsecured line of credit had $50.0 million outstanding and $405.0 million was available for future use. The line of credit provides that the Company may increase the aggregate financing commitments, through the existing lenders and/or through new lenders, up to a total of $550.0 million, subject to certain conditions.\n\u2022The majority of the Company's portfolio of student loans is funded in asset-backed securitizations that will generate significant earnings and cash flow over the life of these transactions. As of December 31, 2019, the Company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its securitization portfolio to be approximately $1.89 billion, of which approximately $1.28 billion will be generated over the next six years.\n\u2022Certain of the Company's asset-backed securitizations were structured as Turbo Transactions\u201d which required all cash generated from the student loans (including excess spread) to be directed toward payment of interest and any outstanding principal generally until such time as all principal on the notes had been paid in full. Once the notes in such transactions were paid in full, the remaining unencumbered student loans (and other remaining assets, if any) in the securitization would be released to the Company, at which time the Company would have the option to refinance or sell these assets, or retain them on the balance sheet as unencumbered assets.\nDuring 2019, the Company extinguished a total of $1.05 billion of notes payable in certain asset-backed securitizations, including six of the Company's eight Turbo Transactions, prior to the notes' contractual maturities, resulting in the release of $1.45 billion in student loans and accrued interest receivable that were previously encumbered in the asset-backed securitizations. Upon extinguishment of the notes payable throughout 2019, the Company refinanced the student loans in its FFELP warehouse facilities and new asset-backed securitizations, resulting in net cash proceeds of $387.1 million.\nThe cash proceeds generated by the debt extinguishments were used to pay down a significant portion of the outstanding balance on the Company's unsecured line of credit and provides the Company with increased liquidity and the opportunity to invest the previously underutilized capital at higher returns.\n\u2022In 2019, the Company obtained a consumer loan warehouse facility with an aggregate maximum financing amount available of $200.0 million and a final maturity date of April 23, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, $116.6 million was outstanding under this facility and $83.4 million was available for future funding.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed seven FFELP asset-backed securitizations totaling $2.8 billion (par value). The proceeds from these transactions were used primarily to refinance student loans included in the Company's FFELP warehouse facilities and unencumbered student loans from the extinguishment of certain asset-backed securitizations.\n\u2022On June 25, 2019, the Company completed a private education loan asset-backed securitization totaling $47.2 million (par value). The proceeds from this transaction were used to refinance private education loans previously funded via a private loan repurchase agreement that was terminated on June 25, 2019.\n\u2022During 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 726,273 shares of Class A common stock for $40.4 million ($55.64 per share).\n\u2022On May 8, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to a total of five million shares of the Company's Class A common stock during the three-year period ending May 7, 2022. As of\nDecember 31, 2019, 4.8 million shares remained authorized for repurchase under the Company's stock repurchase program.\n\u2022During 2019, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $29.5 million ($0.74 per share).\n\u2022The Company intends to use its liquidity position to capitalize on market opportunities, including FFELP, private education, and consumer loan acquisitions; strategic acquisitions and investments; expansion of ALLO's telecommunications network; and capital management initiatives, including stock repurchases, debt repurchases, and dividend distributions. The timing and size of these opportunities will vary and will have a direct impact on the Company's cash and investment balances.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAn analysis of the Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 is provided below.\nThe Company's operating results are primarily driven by the performance of its existing loan portfolio and the revenues generated by its fee-based businesses and the costs to provide such services. The performance of the Company's portfolio is driven by net interest income (which includes financing costs) and losses related to credit quality of the assets, along with the cost to administer and service the assets and related debt.\nThe Company operates as distinct reportable operating segments as described above. For a reconciliation of the reportable segment operating results to the consolidated results of operations, see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report. Since the Company monitors and assesses its operations and results based on these segments, the discussion following the consolidated results of operations is presented on a reportable segment basis.\n Year ended December 31, 2019 2018 Additional information Loan interest $ 914,256 897,666 Increase was due primarily to an increase in the gross yield earned on loans, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of loans and a decrease in gross fixed rate floor income due to higher interest rates in 2019 as compared to 2018. Investment interest 34,421 26,600 Includes income from unrestricted interest-earning deposits and investments and funds in asset-backed securitizations. Increase was due to increases in interest-earning investments and interest rates. Total interest income 948,677 924,266 Interest expense 699,327 669,906 Increase was due to an increase in cost of funds, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of debt outstanding. Net interest income 249,350 254,360 See table below for additional analysis.
