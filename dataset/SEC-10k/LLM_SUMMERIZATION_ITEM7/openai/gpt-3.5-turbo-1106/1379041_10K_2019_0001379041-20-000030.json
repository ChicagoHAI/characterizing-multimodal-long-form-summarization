Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes thereto, and the financial statement schedules included in Item 8 and Item 15 of this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors described in Item 1A of this report. Our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including the risks described in the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a Nevada holding company. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to select, small businesses in low to medium hazard industries. Workers' compensation insurance is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees' medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation, and/or death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. We provide workers' compensation insurance throughout the United States, with a concentration in California, where nearly one-half of our business is generated. Our revenues are primarily comprised of net premiums earned, net investment income, and net realized and unrealized gains on investments.\nWe target small businesses, as we believe that this market is traditionally characterized by fewer competitors, more attractive pricing, and stronger persistency when compared to the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry in general. We believe we are able to price our policies at levels that are competitive and profitable over the long-term given our expertise in underwriting and claims handling in this market segment. Our underwriting approach is to consistently underwrite small business accounts at appropriate and competitive prices without sacrificing long-term profitability and stability for short-term top-line revenue growth.\nOur calendar year underwriting results have improved over the past several years. This improvement reflects our superior claims handling and the increased pricing flexibility afforded to us through the use of multiple writing companies within states and territorial pricing in California. In addition, our ongoing underwriting initiatives, which are described below, have allowed us to expand our operations while also focusing on under-performing classes of business, as needed.\nPricing on our renewals showed an overall price decrease of 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, versus the rate level in effect on such business a year earlier. We believe that we can continue to write attractive business due to favorable loss costs and frequency trends and the success of our accelerated claims initiatives, despite the competitive market conditions we currently face. Given the strength of our balance sheet, the execution of our underwriting, claims, and investment strategies, we believe that we are well positioned for the current market cycle.\nOn July 31, 2019, we acquired (the Acquisition) PartnerRe Insurance Company of New York (PRNY) from Partner Reinsurance Company of the U.S. (PRUS). We funded the Acquisition with cash on hand. The purchase price was equal to the sum of: (i) $47.6 million, the amount of statutory capital and surplus of PRNY at closing; and (ii) $5.8 million. We did not acquire any employees or ongoing business operations pursuant to the Acquisition.\nPursuant to the purchase agreement, all liabilities and obligations of PRNY existing as of the closing date, whether known or unknown, will be indemnified by PRUS. In addition, PartnerRe Ltd., the parent company of PRUS, has provided us with a guaranty that unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees the full and prompt payment and performance by PRUS of all of its obligations, liabilities and indemnities under the purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. If PRUS and PartnerRe Ltd. were to fail to honor their obligations to us under the purchase agreement, all or a portion of the remaining gross loss and LAE reserves acquired by us pursuant to the Acquisition would become our responsibility.\nSubsequent to completing the Acquisition, PRNY was renamed CIC.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for the three year period ending December 31, 2019 are as follows:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>691.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>723.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>731.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments\n</td> <td>51.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on redemption of notes payable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>835.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>365.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expense\n</td> <td>88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting and general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>187.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and financing expenses\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>642.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>657.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before income taxes\n</td> <td>193.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nOur net income was $157.1 million, $141.3 million, and $101.2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

Period over period changes in gross premiums earned during 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to our Employers segment. See -Summary of Financial Results by Segment -Employers.\nNet Premiums Written\nNet premiums written are gross premiums written less reinsurance premiums ceded.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned are primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums previously written.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\nWe invest in fixed maturity securities, equity securities, other invested assets, short-term investments, and cash equivalents. Net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities, less bank service charges and custodial and portfolio management fees. We have established a high quality/short duration bias in our investment portfolio.\nNet investment income was $88.1 million, $81.2 million, and $74.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the allocation and yield of bank loans and other invested assets. The average pre-tax ending book yield on our invested assets was 3.3%, 3.4%, and 3.1% at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The average ending tax-equivalent yield on our invested assets (which adjusts the book yield of our investments in tax-advantaged securities to an equivalent pre-tax book yield) was 3.5% at each of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nRealized and certain unrealized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original or adjusted cost (equity securities) or amortized cost (fixed maturity securities). Realized losses are also recognized when securities are written down as a result of an other-than-temporary impairment. Changes in fair value of equity securities (for 2019 and 2018) and other invested assets are also included in Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments were $51.1 million, $(13.1) million, and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nNet realized and unrealized gains on investments in 2019 included $46.5 million of net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities, $3.9 million of net realized gains on fixed maturity securities, and $0.7 million of unrealized gains on other invested assets. Net gains on equity securities were largely consistent with the performance of U.S. equity markets. Realized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily related to sales associated with a reallocation of our investment portfolio. Net realized and unrealized losses on investments in 2018 included $11.3 million of net realized and unrealized losses on equity securities and $1.8 million of net realized losses on fixed maturity securities. The net losses on equity securities for 2018 were primarily the result of volatility in equity markets. Net losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily related to the sale of fixed maturity securities resulting from a rebalancing of our investment portfolio, offset by $3.3 million in other-than-temporary impairments of certain fixed maturity securities due to our intent to sell the securities. Net gains on fixed maturity securities were primarily related to the sale of fixed maturity securities resulting from a rebalancing of our investment portfolio. Net realized gains on investments in 2017 included $5.8 million of net realized gains on equity securities and $3.0 million of net realized gains on fixed maturity securities. The net gains were primarily related to sales of municipal securities, whose proceeds were reinvested in taxable fixed maturity securities, and sales of equity securities as part of a routine rebalancing of our equity portfolio. Those gains were partially offset by $1.4 million in other-than temporary impairments of certain fixed maturity and equity securities due to our intent to sell those securities and/or the severity and duration of the change in fair value of those securities. Additional information regarding our Investments is set forth under \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Investments\" and Note 5 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGain on Redemption of Notes Payable\nIn May 2017, we purchased one of EPIC's outstanding notes payable in the amount of $12.0 million for $9.9 million, resulting in a $2.1 million gain.\nOther Income\nOther income consists of net gains on fixed assets, non-investment interest, installment fee revenue, and other miscellaneous income.\nLosses and LAE\nLosses and LAE represents our largest expense item and includes claim payments made, amortization of the Deferred Gain, LPT Reserve Adjustments, LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments, estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods, and costs associated with investigating, defending, and adjusting claims. The quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and LAE, which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques.\nOur indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) continued to decrease year-over-year in 2019 and 2018; however, medical and indemnity costs per claim increased over the same period. These trends are reflected\nin our current accident year loss estimate. Total claims costs have also been reduced by cost savings associated with increased claims settlement activity that continued through 2019. We believe our current accident year loss estimate is adequate; however, ultimate losses will not be known with any certainty for many years. We assume that increasing medical and indemnity cost trends will continue to impact our long-term claims costs and current accident year loss estimate, which may be offset by rate increases. Additional information regarding our reserves for losses and LAE is set forth under \"-Critical Accounting Policies -Reserves for Losses and LAE.\" See also, \"-Summary of Financial Results by Segment -Employers.\"\nCommission Expenses\nCommission expenses include direct commissions to our agents and brokers, including our partnerships and alliances, for the premiums that they produce for us, as well as incentive payments, other marketing costs, and fees. See \"-Summary of Financial Results by Segment -Employers.\"\nUnderwriting and General and Administrative Expenses\nUnderwriting expenses represent those costs that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue, excluding commissions. Direct underwriting expenses, such as premium taxes, policyholder dividends, and those expenses that vary directly with the production of new or renewal business, are recognized as the associated premiums are earned. Indirect underwriting expenses, such as the operating expenses of each of the Company's subsidiaries, do not vary directly with the production of new or renewal business and are recognized as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative expenses of the holding company are excluded in determining the underwriting expense ratios of our reportable segments.\nInterest and Financing Expenses\nInterest and financing expenses include surplus notes interest, letter of credit fees, finance lease interest, and other financing fees.\nOther Expenses\nWe actively invest in technology and systems across our business with a view toward maximizing efficiency, facilitating customer self-service, and creating increased capacity that will allow us to lower our expense ratios while growing premiums. In 2017, we wrote-off $7.5 million of previously capitalized costs relating to the development of information technology capabilities that had not yet been placed in service. This charge was the result of our continual evaluation of ongoing technology initiatives.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOn January 1, 2000, EICN assumed the assets, liabilities, and operations of the Fund pursuant to legislation passed in the 1999 Nevada Legislature (the Privatization). Prior to the Privatization, the Fund was part of the State of Nevada and therefore was not subject to federal income tax. Accordingly, our pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments and Deferred Gain amortization impact our net income but do not change our taxable income.\nIncome tax expense was $36.7 million, $28.2 million ($28.6 million excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 (Enactment)), and $42.8 million ($35.8 million excluding the impact of Enactment) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 18.9%, 16.6% (16.8% excluding the impact of Enactment), and 29.7% (24.9% excluding the impact of Enactment) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nEnactment significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning January 1, 2018. This reduction in the corporate statutory income tax rate required us to re-evaluate certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of the date of Enactment, to reflect the revised income tax rates applicable to future periods.\nTax-advantaged investment income, LPT Reserve Adjustments, LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018, and 35% for 2017 by $4.0 million, $7.4 million, and $14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the reductions were partially offset by a $7.0 million increase in our income tax expense due to the re-evaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of Enactment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we were required to base certain of our income tax estimates and assumptions on incomplete information and/or preliminary interpretations of the effects of Enactment. As a result, we decreased our income tax expense by $0.4 million due to a further evaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor additional information regarding our income tax expense see Note 7 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSummary of Financial Results by Segment\nEMPLOYERS\nThe components of Employers' net income before income taxes are set forth in the following table:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>691.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>723.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>731.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>84.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on redemption of notes payable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>828.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>796.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>378.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expense\n</td> <td>88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expenses\n</td> <td>153.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and financing expenses\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>620.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>652.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>89.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnderwriting Results\nGross Premiums Written\nGross premiums written were $696.8 million, $748.9 million, and $729.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to decreases in final audit premiums and average rates, as well as declines in new business premiums written in California, partially offset by increases in renewal premiums written across all of our markets. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to increases in new business premiums written, partially offset by declines in renewal business premiums. The increase in new business premiums was primarily driven by higher policy counts and payroll exposure, partially offset by decreases in average rates.\nNet Premiums Written\nNet premiums written were $691.4 million, $742.8 million, and $723.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, which included $5.4 million, $6.1 million, and $6.0 million of reinsurance premiums ceded, respectively.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned were $695.8 million, $731.1 million, and $716.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table shows the percentage change in Employers' in-force premiums, policy count, average policy size, and payroll exposure upon which our premiums are based as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, overall, for California, where nearly 50% of our premiums were generated, and for all other states, excluding California:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n2019 Over 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n2018 Over 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Overall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>All Other States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Overall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>All Other States\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force premiums\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force policy count\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average in-force policy size\n</td> <td>(7.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force payroll exposure\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLosses and LAE, Commission Expenses, and Underwriting Expenses\nPrior to December 31, 2019, we operated under a single reportable segment and presented our Combined Ratio on that basis, including general and administrative expenses of the holding company expenses and the impact of the LPT. Beginning in 2019, we now present the Combined Ratio for each of our reporting segments on a stand-alone basis and have adjusted all prior periods to conform to this presentation.\nThe following table presents calendar year combined ratios for our Employers segment.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>54.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expense ratio\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>89.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss and LAE Ratio. We analyze our loss and LAE ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis.\nThe calendar year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and LAE recorded during the calendar year, regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred, by the net premiums earned during that calendar year. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and LAE established for insured events occurring in the current and prior years. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods.\nThe accident year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing cumulative losses and LAE for reported events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year. The accident year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably. The accident year loss and LAE ratio is based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our GAAP financial information.\nWe analyze our calendar year loss and LAE ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and LAE from all periods, including development (whether favorable or unfavorable) of reserves established in prior periods. In contrast, we analyze our accident year loss and LAE ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and LAE from insured events occurring during that year. The loss and LAE ratios provided in this report are calendar year basis, except where they are expressly identified as accident year loss and LAE ratios.\nThe table below reflects prior accident year loss and LAE reserve adjustments and the impact to loss ratio.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior accident year favorable development, net\n</td> <td>77.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current accident year losses and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>456.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>457.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current accident year loss ratio\n</td> <td>65.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in our losses and LAE from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to increased favorable prior accident year loss development of $77.5 million, partially offset by an increase in our current accident year loss estimate. The decrease in our losses\nand LAE from 2017 to 2018 was primarily attributable to increased favorable prior accident year loss development of $66.2 million, which included $65.5 million of favorable development on our voluntary risk business and $0.7 million of favorable development related to our assigned risk business. Favorable prior accident year loss development in each period was the result of our determination that adjustments were necessary to reflect observed favorable paid loss trends, primarily for the 2014 through 2017 accident years, which have been impacted by our internal initiatives to reduce loss costs, including the accelerated claims settlement activity that began in 2014 and that continued through 2019.\nThe increases in our current accident year loss estimate in 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the impact of increased competitive pressures and resulting price decreases across most of our markets; however, our current accident year loss and LAE ratio continues to reflect the impact of key business initiatives, including: an emphasis on the accelerated settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, underwrite, and price profitable classes of business across all of our markets.\nCommission Expense Ratio. The commission expense ratio was 12.7%, 12.9%, and 12.8%, and our commission expenses were $88.1 million, $94.2 million, and $91.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the commission expense ratio for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of decreases in 2019 agency incentive commissions, which were directly impacted by decreases in premiums written. The increase in the commission expense ratio for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of increased levels of agency incentive commissions and an increase in the percentage of business produced by our partnerships and alliances for those years, which are subject to a higher commission rate.\nUnderwriting Expense Ratio. The underwriting expense ratio was 22.0%, 18.5%, and 17.3%, and our underwriting expenses were $153.2 million, $135.0 million, and $123.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our IT related expense increased $4.9 million, our professional fees increased $6.0 million, and our compensation-related expenses increased $4.3 million, each as compared to 2018. These increases were largely the result of our aggressive development and implementation of new digital technologies and capabilities. Additionally, our bad debt expense increased $3.5 million compared to 2018, mainly as a result of an increase in the amount of premiums receivable relating to 2018 policy year final audits that were deemed uncollectible in 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our compensation-related expenses increased $3.4 million, our professional fees increased $3.2 million, our bad debt expense increased $1.4 million, and our premium tax and assessments increased $1.4 million, each as compared to 2017.\nUnderwriting Income\nUnderwriting income for our Employers segment was $75.9 million, $110.6 million, and $72.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Underwriting income or loss is determined by deducting losses and LAE, commission expense, and underwriting expenses from net premiums earned.\nNon-Underwriting Income and Expenses\nFor a further discussion of non-underwriting related income and expenses, including Net Investment Income and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments, Gain on Redemption of Notes Payable, Other Income, Interest and Financing Expenses, and Other Expenses see \"-Results of Operations -Summary of Consolidated Financial Results.\"\nCERITY\nThe components of Cerity's net loss before income taxes are set forth in the following table:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized gains on investments\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expenses\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m - not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnderwriting Results\nGross Premiums Written and Net Premiums Written\nGross premiums written and net premiums written were $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, our compensation-related expenses increased $3.8 million and professional fees increased $1.7 million, each as compared to 2017. These year-over-year increases were related to the launch of Cerity and the development of its direct-to-customer platform.\nUnderwriting Loss\nUnderwriting losses for our Cerity segment were $16.0 million, $5.9 million, and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, our professional fees increased $0.5 million, and our compensation-related expenses increased $0.2 million, each as compared to 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our compensation-related expenses increased $1.6 million, and our professional fees increased $1.0 million, each as compared to 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHolding Company Liquidity\nWe are a holding company and our ability to fund our operations is contingent upon existing capital and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends up to the holding company. Payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws and regulations, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. We require cash to pay stockholder dividends, repurchase common stock, provide additional surplus to our insurance subsidiaries, and fund our operating expenses.\nOur insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to their parent is based on reported capital, surplus, and dividends paid within the prior 12 months. For 2020, the maximum dividend that may be paid by EPIC without prior regulatory approval is $21.7 million. EICN can pay $1.4 million of dividends through March 1, 2020, and $21.1 million thereafter, without prior regulatory approval; ECIC cannot pay any dividends through September 23, 2020 without prior regulatory approval, and $32.1 million thereafter; and EAC can pay $1.2 million of dividends through June 12, 2020, and $20.9 million thereafter, without prior regulatory approval. CIC cannot pay dividends without prior regulatory approval until July 31, 2021.\nTotal cash and investments at the holding company were $64.6 million at December 31, 2019, consisting of $9.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $26.6 million of fixed maturity securities, and $28.1 million of equity securities. We do not currently have a revolving credit facility because we believe that the holding company's cash needs for the foreseeable future will be met with its cash and investments on hand, as well as dividends available from our insurance subsidiaries.\nOperating Subsidiaries' Liquidity\nThe primary sources of cash for our operating subsidiaries, which include our insurance and other operating subsidiaries, are premium collections, investment income, sales and maturities of investments and reinsurance recoveries. The primary uses of cash for our operating subsidiaries are payments of losses and LAE, commission expenses, underwriting and general and administrative expenses, ceded reinsurance, investment purchases and dividends paid to their parent.\nTotal cash and investments held by our operating subsidiaries was $2,869.0 million at December 31, 2019, consisting of $145.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, $2,459.3 million of fixed maturity securities, $235.3 million of equity securities, and $29.1 million of other invested assets. Sources of immediate and unencumbered liquidity at our operating subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 consisted of $145.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, $228.6 million of publicly-traded equity securities whose proceeds are available within three business days, and $1,167.0 million of highly liquid fixed maturity securities whose proceeds are available within three business days. We believe that our subsidiaries' liquidity needs over the next 24 months will be met with cash from operations, investment income, and maturing investments.\nEICN, ECIC, EPIC, and EAC are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB). Membership allows our subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support and enhance liquidity management. The amount of advances that may be taken is dependent on statutory admitted assets on a per company basis. Currently, none of our subsidiaries has advances outstanding under the FHLB facility.\nFHLB membership also allows our insurance subsidiaries access to Letter of Credit Agreements and on March 9, 2018, ECIC, EPIC, and EAC entered into Letter of Credit Agreements with the FHLB. On March 1, 2019 FHLB and ECIC, EPIC, and EAC each amended their Letter of Credit Agreements to increase their respective credit amounts. The Letter of Credit Agreements are between the FHLB and each of EAC, in the amount of $60.0 million, ECIC, in the amount of $90.0 million, and EPIC, in the amount of $110.0 million. The amended Letter of Credit Agreements became effective March 1, 2019 and expire March 31, 2020. The amended Letter of Credit Agreements may only be used to satisfy, in whole or in part, insurance deposit requirements with the State of California and are fully secured with eligible collateral at all times (See Note 10).\nWe purchase reinsurance to protect us against the costs of severe claims and catastrophic events. On July 1, 2019, we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through June 30, 2020. The reinsurance program consists of one treaty covering excess of loss and catastrophic loss events in four layers of coverage. Our reinsurance coverage is $190.0 million in excess of our $10.0 million retention on a per occurrence basis, subject to certain exclusions. We believe that our reinsurance program meets our needs and that we are sufficiently capitalized.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis. Surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets. The amount of capital in our insurance subsidiaries is maintained relative to standardized capital adequacy measures such as risk-based capital (RBC), as established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The RBC standard was designed to provide a measure by which regulators can assess the adequacy of an insurance company's capital and surplus relative to its operations. An insurance company must maintain capital and surplus of at least 200% of RBC. Each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the minimum RBC requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action at December 31, 2019.\nVarious state laws and regulations require us to hold investment securities or letters of credit on deposit with certain states in which we do business. Securities having a fair value of $844.9 million and $867.7 million were on deposit at each of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These laws and regulations govern both the amount and types of investment securities that are eligible for deposit. Additionally, standby letters of credit from the FHLB have been issued in lieu of $260.0 million and $140.0 million of securities on deposit at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCertain reinsurance contracts require company funds to be held in trust for the benefit of the ceding reinsurer to secure the outstanding liabilities we assumed. The fair value of fixed maturity securities held in trust for the benefit of our ceding reinsurers was $2.9 million and $23.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe monitor the cash flows of each of our subsidiaries individually, as well as collectively as a consolidated group. We use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs, making adjustments to our forecasts as appropriate.\nThe table below shows our net cash flows. For additional information regarding our cash flows, see Item 8, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>49.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(119.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(119.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2019 included net premiums received of $746.2 million, investment income received of $98.5 million, and cash received of $19.1 million for the LPT Contingent Commission. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $403.3 million, underwriting and general and administrative expenses paid of $184.8 million, commissions paid of $95.1 million, and federal income taxes paid of $37.8 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2018 included net premiums received of $745.9 million and investment income received of $91.1 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $416.4 million, underwriting and general and administrative expenses paid of $142.1 million, and commissions paid of $92.6 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 included net premiums received of $702.4 million and investment income received of $90.0 million. These operating cash inflows were partially offset by net claims payments of $419.2 million, underwriting and general and administrative expenses paid of $123.6 million, and commissions paid of $84.6 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was primarily related to sales, maturities, and redemptions of investments whose proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of CIC, claims payments, underwriting and general and administrative expenses, stockholder dividend payments, debt repayment, and common stock repurchases, partially offset by the investment of premiums received and reinvestment of funds from investment sales, maturities, redemptions, and interest income.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2018 and 2017 was primarily related to the investment of premiums received and the reinvestment of funds from maturities, redemptions, and interest income. These investing cash outflows were partially offset by investment sales whose proceeds were used to fund claims payments, underwriting and general and administrative expenses, stockholder dividend payments, and for common stock repurchases during 2018.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2019 included common stock repurchases, the redemption of notes payable, and stockholder dividend payments.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2018 included common stock repurchases and stockholder dividend payments.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2017 included stockholder dividend payments and the purchase of a note payable.\nDividends. Dividends paid to stockholders were $28.9 million, $26.7 million, and $19.7 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to common stockholders will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial position, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, legal and regulatory requirements, and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. On February 14, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a $0.25 dividend per share, payable March 18, 2020, to stockholders of record on March 4, 2020.\nShare Repurchases. On February 21, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for repurchases of up to $50.0 million of our common stock from February 26, 2018 through February 26, 2020 (the 2018 Program). On April 24, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million expansion of the 2018 Program, to $100.0 million, and extended the repurchase authority pursuant to the 2018 Program through June 30, 2020. The 2018 Program provides that shares may be purchased at prevailing market prices through a variety of methods, including open market or private transactions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and as determined by management. The timing and actual number of shares that may be repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and economic conditions. Repurchases under the 2018 Program may be commenced, modified, or suspended from time to time without prior\nnotice, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Through December 31, 2019, we repurchased a total of 1,731,637 shares of common stock under the 2018 Program at an average price of $41.40 per share, including commissions, for a total cost of $71.7 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had a remaining common stock repurchase authorization of $28.3 million under the 2018 Program. See Item 5, Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nCapital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, the capital resources available to us consisted of $1,165.8 million of stockholders' equity and the $137.1 million Deferred Gain.\nStockholders' Equity.

Additionally, we had other invested assets of $29.1 million at December 31, 2019. These investments provide a steady source of income, which may fluctuate with changes in interest rates and our current investment strategies.\nWe also have a $6.7 million investment in FHLB stock which we record at cost. We receive periodic dividends from the FHLB for this investment, when declared, which can vary from period to period.\nOur Investment Managers follow our written investment guidelines, which are approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Our asset allocation is reevaluated by management and reviewed by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We also utilize our Investment Managers' investment advisory services to assist us in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our investment portfolio consisted of 89% fixed maturity securities. We strive to limit the interest rate risk associated with fixed maturity investments by managing the duration of these securities. Our fixed maturity securities (excluding cash and cash equivalents) had a duration of 3.3 at December 31, 2019. To minimize interest rate risk, our portfolio is weighted toward short-term and intermediate-term bonds; however, our investment strategy balances consideration of duration, yield, and credit risk. Our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio be \"A+,\" using ratings assigned by S&P. Our fixed maturity securities portfolio had a weighted average quality of \"A+\" as of December 31, 2019, with 52.9% of the portfolio rated \"AA\" or better, based on market value. Other securities within fixed maturity securities consist of bank loans, which are classified as AFS and are reported at fair value.\nWe also have a portfolio of publicly traded equity securities. We strive to limit the exposure to equity price risk associated with equity securities by diversifying our holdings across several industry sectors. Equity securities represented 9% of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2019.\nOur Other invested assets made up 1% of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and include private equity limited partnerships and convertible preferred shares of real estate investment trusts. Our investments in private equity limited partnerships totaled $9.1 million at December 31, 2019 and are generally not redeemable by the investees and cannot be sold without prior approval of the general partner. These investments have a fund term of 12 years, subject to three one-year extensions at the general partner's discretion. We expect to receive distributions of proceeds from dividends and interest from fund investments, as well as from the disposition of a fund investment or portion thereof, from time-to-time during the full course of the fund term. As of December 31, 2019, we had unfunded commitments to these private equity limited partnerships totaling $41.6 million. Our investments in convertible preferred shares of real estate investment trusts totaled $20.0 million at December 31, 2019 and are non-redeemable until conversion and are periodically evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recovery of the investment.\nWe believe that our current asset allocation meets our strategy to preserve capital for claims and policy liabilities and to provide sufficient capital resources to support and grow our ongoing insurance operations.\nThe following table shows the estimated fair value, the percentage of the fair value to total invested assets, the average ending book yield, and the average ending tax equivalent yield (each based on the book value of each category of invested assets) as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Book Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tax Equivalent Yield(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasuries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>States and municipalities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>484.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,079.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgaged-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial mortgaged-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,742.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average ending yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Computed using a statutory income tax rate of 21%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The following table shows the percentage of total estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2019 by credit rating category, using the lower of the ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service or S&P.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\nEstimated Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\"AAA\"\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\"AA\"\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\"A\"\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\"BBB\"\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Below Investment Grade\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments that we currently own could be subject to default by the issuer or could suffer declines in fair value that become other-than-temporary. We regularly assess individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management, including the identification of other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Our other-than-temporary impairment assessment includes reviewing the extent and duration of declines in fair value of investments below amortized cost, historical and projected financial performance and near-term prospects of the issuer, the outlook for industry sectors, credit rating, and macro-economic changes. We also make a determination as to whether it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its fair value recovers to above cost, or maturity.\nWe believe that we have appropriately identified the declines in the fair values of our unrealized losses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. We recognized no other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities during the year ended December 31, 2019. We recognized impairments on fixed maturity securities of $3.3 million (consisting of 66 securities) and $0.5 million (consisting of nine securities) during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The other-than-temporary impairments recognized during these years were the result of our intent to sell these securities and/or the severity of the change in fair values of these securities. We determined that the remaining unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily the result of prevailing interest rates and not the credit quality of the issuers. The remaining fixed maturity securities whose fair value was less than amortized cost were not determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired given the lack of severity and duration of the impairment, the credit quality of the issuers, our intent to not sell the securities, and a determination that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities until fair value recovers to above cost, or principal value upon maturity.\nThe adoption of ASU 2016-01 removed the impairment assessment for equity securities at fair value beginning in 2018, and changes in fair value are included in Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Prior to the adoption of this standard, we recognized impairments on equity securities of $0.9 million (consisting of seven equity securities) during the year ended December 31, 2017. The other-than temporary impairments recognized during this year was the result of our intent to sell and/or the severity and duration of the change in fair values of these securities. Certain unrealized losses on equity securities in 2017 were not considered to be other-than-temporary due to the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, and our intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers to above cost.\nFor additional information regarding our investments, including the cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and estimated fair value of our investments, the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities by contractual maturity, and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments, see Note 5 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires both the use of estimates and judgment, relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. Our accounting policies are described in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, but we believe that the following matters are particularly important to understand our financial statements because changes in these estimates or changes in the assumptions used to make them could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nReserves for Losses and LAE\nAccounting for workers' compensation insurance requires us to estimate the liability for the expected ultimate cost of unpaid losses and LAE (loss reserves) as of a balance sheet date. Loss reserve estimates are inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount we pay for many of the claims we have incurred as of the balance sheet date will not be known for many years. Our estimate of loss reserves is intended to equal the difference between the expected ultimate losses and LAE of all claims that have occurred as of a balance sheet date and amounts already paid. We establish loss reserves based on our own analysis of emerging claims experience and environmental conditions in our markets and review of the results of various actuarial projections. Our aggregate carried loss reserves is the sum of our reserves for each accident year and represents our best estimate of outstanding loss reserves.\nThe amount by which estimated losses in the aggregate differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve \"development.\" Reserve development is unfavorable when losses ultimately settle for more than the amount estimated or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases, causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be ''deficient.'' Reserve development is favorable when estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves, causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be ''redundant.'' Development is reflected in our operating results through an adjustment to incurred losses and LAE during the period in which it is recognized.\nAlthough claims for which reserves are established may not be paid for several years or more, we do not discount loss reserves in our financial statements for the time value of money, in accordance with GAAP.\nThe three main components of our loss reserves are case reserves, incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss reserves, and LAE reserves.\nWhen claims are reported to us, we establish individual estimates of the ultimate cost of each claim (case reserves). These case reserves are continually monitored and revised in response to new information and for amounts paid.\nIn addition to case reserves, we establish a provision for IBNR. IBNR is an actuarial estimate comprised of the following: (a) future payments on claims that are incurred but have not yet been reported to us; (b) a reserve for the additional development on claims that have been reported to us; and (c) a provision for additional payments on closed claims that might reopen. IBNR reserves apply to the entire body of claims arising from a specific time period, rather than a specific claim. Most of our IBNR reserves relate to estimated future claim payments on recorded open claims.\nLAE reserves are our estimate of future expense payments to manage, investigate, administer, and settle claims that have occurred, and include legal expenses. LAE reserves are established in the aggregate, rather than on a claim-by-claim basis. LAE reserves are categorized between defense and cost containment, and adjusting and other.\nWe cede a portion of our obligations for losses and LAE to unaffiliated reinsurers. The amount of reinsurance that will be recoverable on our losses and LAE includes both the reinsurance recoverable from our excess of loss reinsurance contracts, as well as reinsurance recoverable under the terms of the LPT Agreement.\nOur loss reserves (gross and net of reinsurance), including the main components of such reserves, were as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Case reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>951.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>940.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IBNR\n</td> <td>940.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>955.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LAE reserves\n</td> <td>300.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross unpaid losses and LAE reserves\n</td> <td>2,192.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,207.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and LAE\n</td> <td>532.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unpaid losses and LAE reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,660.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,703.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use actuarial methods to analyze and estimate the aggregate amount of loss reserves. Management considers the results of various actuarial methods and their underlying assumptions, among other factors, in establishing loss reserves.\nJudgment is required in the actuarial estimation of loss reserves, including the selection of various actuarial methodologies to project the ultimate cost of claims. Specifically, judgment is required in the following areas: the selection of parameters utilized in the various methodologies; the use of industry data and other benchmarks; and the weighting of differing reserve indications resulting from alternative methods and assumptions. The adequacy of our ultimate loss reserves is inherently uncertain and represents a significant risk to our business. We attempt to mitigate this risk through our claims management processes and by monitoring and reacting to statistics relating to the cost and duration of claims.\nIn each of the periods presented herein we retained an independent actuarial consulting firm (Consulting Actuary) to perform comprehensive studies of our loss reserves on a semi-annual basis. The role of the Consulting Actuary was to conduct sufficient analyses to produce a range of reasonable estimates, as well as a point estimate, of our loss reserves, and to present those results to our Internal Actuary and to management as supplemental data in selecting management's best estimate of ultimate losses.\nWe compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year in which the claim occurred (\"accident year\") when analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time. Additionally, we aggregate and analyze claims data by claim type, benefits type, and by state, territory within state, or groups of states in which we do business.\nOur Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary prepared reserve estimates for all accident years using our own historical claims data, industry data and many of the generally accepted actuarial methodologies for estimating loss reserves, such as paid loss development methods, incurred loss development methods, and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. These methods vary in their responsiveness to different information, characteristics, and dynamics in the data, and the results assist the actuary in considering these characteristics and dynamics in the historical data. The methods employed for each segment of claims data, and the relative weight accorded to each method, vary depending on the nature of the claims segment and on the age of the claims.\nEach actuarial methodology requires the selection and application of various parameters and assumptions. The key parameters and assumptions include: the future payment and emergence patterns of our aggregate claims data; the magnitude and changes in claim settlement activity; claims cost inflation rates; the effects of legislative benefit changes and/or judicial decisions; and trends in the frequency and severity of claims. We believe the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or emerge over time, claim settlement activity, and claims cost inflation rates are the most important parameters and assumptions.\nManagement, along with our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary, separately analyzed LAE and estimate unpaid LAE. These analyses rely primarily on examining the relationship between historical aggregate paid LAE and the volume of claims activity for the corresponding periods. The portion of unpaid LAE that will be recoverable from reinsurers is estimated based on the contractual reinsurance terms.\nThe ranges of estimates of loss reserves produced by our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary are intended to represent the range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses will fall. These ranges are narrower than the range of indications produced by the individual methods applied because it is not likely that the high or low result will emerge for every claim segment and accident year. Each actuary's point estimate of loss reserves for each claim segment is based on a judgmental selection from within the range of results indicated by the different actuarial methods.\nManagement formally establishes loss reserves for financial statement purposes on a quarterly basis. In doing so, we make reference to the most current analyses of our Internal Actuary and of the Consulting Actuary, including a review of the assumptions and the results of the various actuarial methods used. Both our Internal Actuary and the Consulting Actuary conducted comprehensive studies in the second and fourth quarters. On the alternate quarters, our Internal Actuary updates the results of the preceding quarter's studies for actual claim payment and case reserve activity.\nThe aggregate carried reserve calculated by management represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and LAE. In establishing management's best estimate of unpaid losses and LAE at December 31 for the last three years, management and\nour Internal Actuary reviewed and considered the following: (a) our Internal Actuary's and the Consulting Actuary's assumptions, point estimates, and ranges; and (b) the inherent uncertainty of workers' compensation loss reserves. Management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each uncertainty, but rather established an overall provision that represented management's best estimate of loss reserves in light of the historical data, actuarial assumptions, point estimate and range, and current facts and circumstances.\nThe table below provides the actuarial range of loss reserves, net of reinsurance, that management considered when selecting its best estimate and our carried reserves.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Low end of actuarial range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,489.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,484.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carried reserves\n</td> <td>1,660.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,703.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High end of actuarial range\n</td> <td>1,855.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,897.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, California and Nevada loss reserves represented approximately 74% of our total loss reserves on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn California, our recent loss experience from 2012 through 2019, indicates a slight downward trend in medical severity and a slight upward trend in indemnity severity. The reduction in medical severity can be attributed to a number of factors including California Senate Bill 863 (SB 863), which was enacted in 2012 and largely became effective in 2013/2014. Among the more significant changes, SB 863 introduced independent medical review (IMR) into the dispute resolution process and filing fees for medical liens. On the indemnity side, various provisions of SB 863 resulted in an overall increase in certain benefits. Our indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) has decreased year-over-year for the past four years. Aside from the impact of recent regulatory changes, we believe our increased emphasis on claims settlements, as well as our various underwriting initiatives, have contributed to more favorable trends in our California results.\nIn Nevada, we have compiled a lengthy history of workers' compensation claims payment patterns based on the business of the Fund and EICN, but the emergence and payment of claims in recent years has been more favorable than in the long-term history in Nevada with the Fund. The expected patterns of claim payments and emergence used in the projection of our ultimate claim payments are based on both long and short-term historical data. In recent evaluations, claim patterns have continued to emerge in a manner consistent with short-term historical data. Consequently, our selection of claim projection patterns has relied more heavily on patterns observed in recent years.\nOur insurance subsidiaries have been operating in a period characterized by changing environmental conditions in our major markets, entry into new markets, and operational changes. During periods characterized by such changes, at each evaluation, the actuaries and management must make judgments as to the relative weight to accord to long-term historical company data, more recent company data, and external data. We also consider the impact of environmental and operational changes and other factors when selecting the methods used to project ultimate losses and LAE, the parameters to incorporate in those methods, and the relative weights applied to those methods.\nAn internal initiative that began in 2014 and continued through 2019 emphasizes the settlement of open claims. This initiative has actively driven a significant increase in claims settlement activity and has primarily affected accident years 2009 and forward. This settlement activity has been recognized in the actuarial analysis using a methodology that adjusts the data and loss development patterns to account for an increase in settlements arising from this initiative.\nApproximately 59% of our claims payments during the three years ended December 31, 2019 related to medical care for injured workers. The utilization and cost of medical services in the future is a significant source of uncertainty in the establishment of loss reserves for workers' compensation. Our loss reserves are established based on reviewing the results of actuarial methods, most of which do not contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates; however, because medical care may be provided to an injured worker over many years, and in some cases decades, the pace of medical claim cost inflation can have a significant impact on our ultimate claim payments. For example, if the rate of medical claim cost inflation increases by 1% above the inflation rate that is implicitly included in the loss reserves at December 31, 2019, we estimate that future medical costs over the lifetime of current claims would increase by approximately $81.0 million on a net-of-reinsurance basis.\nThe range of estimates of loss reserves produced by our actuarial reviews of medical cost inflation data provides some indication of the potential variability of future losses and LAE payments; however, the full range of potential variation is difficult to estimate because our insurance subsidiaries do not have a lengthy operating history in many of the states in which we now operate. Our reserve estimates reflect expected increases in the costs of contested claims, but do not assume any losses resulting from significant new legal liability theories. Our reserve estimates also assume that there will not be significant future changes in the regulatory\nand legislative environment. In the event of significant new legal liability theories or new regulation or legislation, we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business.\nIf the actual loss reserves were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range, the pretax impact on our financial results would have been as follows:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in reserves\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At low end of range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(170.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(218.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At high end of range\n</td> <td>195.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in stockholders' equity and net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At low end of range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At high end of range\n</td> <td>(154.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(153.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nActual losses are affected by a more complex combination of forces and dynamics than any one model or actuarial methodology can represent, and each methodology is an approximation of these complex forces and dynamics. None of the methods are designed or intended to produce an indication that is systematically higher or lower than the other methods. At any given evaluation date, some of the actuarial projection methods produce indications outside the actuary's selected range. Accordingly, we believe that the range of potential outcomes is considerably wider than the actuarially estimated range of the most likely outcomes. We have no basis for anticipating whether actual future payments of losses and LAE may be either greater than or less than the loss reserves currently on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAdditionally, any adjustment to the estimated ceded reserves under the LPT Agreement results in a cumulative adjustment to the Deferred Gain, which is also included in losses and LAE incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, so that the Deferred Gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the LPT Agreement. The table below provides the actuarial range of estimated liabilities for gross loss reserves under the LPT Agreement and our carried reserves.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Low end of actuarial range\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LPT carried reserves\n</td> <td>380.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High end of actuarial range\n</td> <td>444.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReinsurance Recoverables\nReinsurance recoverables represent: (a) amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and LAE; (b) amounts recoverable from reinsurers on estimates of reported losses; and (c) amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of IBNR for losses and LAE. These recoverables are based on our current estimates of the underlying loss reserves, and are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets separately as assets, as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders. We bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers, which can be significant considering that some of the loss reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time. Reinsurers may refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them, or they might delay payment. We are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement. We continually monitor the financial condition and financial strength ratings of our reinsurers. No material amounts due from reinsurers have been written-off as uncollectible since our inception in 2000, and we believe that amounts currently reflected on our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment.\nUnder the LPT Agreement, the Fund initially ceded $1.5 billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and LAE related to claims incurred prior to July 1, 1995 for consideration of $775.0 million in cash. The estimated remaining liabilities subject to the LPT Agreement were $380.4 million as of December 31, 2019. Losses and LAE paid with respect to the LPT Agreement totaled $796.2 million at December 31, 2019. We account for the LPT Agreement as retroactive reinsurance. Entry into the LPT Agreement resulted in a deferred reinsurance gain that was recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as a liability. The Deferred Gain is being amortized using the recovery method, whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries through the life of the LPT Agreement, and the amortization is reflected in losses and LAE. Changes in estimates of the reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement may significantly impact the Deferred Gain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and losses and LAE on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nAdditionally, we are entitled to receive a contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. The contingent profit commission is an amount based on the favorable difference between actual paid losses and LAE and expected paid losses and LAE as established\nin the LPT Agreement. The calculation of actual amounts paid versus expected amounts is determined every five years beginning June 30, 2004 for the first twenty-five years of the agreement. We are paid 30% of the favorable difference between the actual and expected losses and LAE paid at each calculation point. Each quarter, management records its best estimate of the estimated ultimate contingent profit commission through June 30, 2024, which is impacted by estimates for ceded losses and LAE. The related Deferred Gain is amortized using the recovery method, whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries over the life of the contingent profit commission, or through June 30, 2024, and is recorded in losses and LAE incurred in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Changes in estimates of the reserves ceded under the LPT Agreement may significantly impact the Contingent commission receivable-LPT Agreement and the Deferred Gain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and losses and LAE on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nRecognition of Premium Revenue\nPremium revenue is recognized as earned over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. At the end of the policy term, payroll-based premium audits are performed on substantially all policyholder accounts to determine net premiums earned for the policy year. Earned but unbilled premiums include estimated future audit premiums based on our historical experience. These estimates are subject to changes in policyholders' payrolls, economic conditions, and seasonality, and are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. Any such adjustments are included in current operations; however, they are partially offset by the resulting changes in losses and LAE, commission expenses, and premium taxes. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, we believe that the net effect of any estimates currently reflected on our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to reverse. The effect of the recent change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities was recognized in income as of the date of Enactment.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, on the basis of a two-step process. Recognition (Step 1) occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step 2) is addressed only if Step 1 has been satisfied. Under Step 2, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets when it is determined that such assets are more likely than not to be realized in future periods. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, projected future tax rates, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, we were required to base certain of our income tax estimates and assumptions on incomplete information and/or preliminary interpretations of the effects of Enactment. As a result, we made an adjustment to our income tax expense due to a further evaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018. The total adjustments made for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $(0.4) million and $7.0 million, respectively.\nValuation of Investments\nOur investments in fixed maturity securities, equity securities at fair value (in 2017 only), and short-term investments are classified as AFS and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of deferred taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nBeginning in 2018, with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, our investments in equity securities at fair value are no longer classified as AFS and changes in fair value are included in Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nRealized gains and losses resulting from sales of investments are recognized in operations on a specific-identification basis.\nWe use third party pricing services to assist us with our investment accounting function. The fair values of our AFS fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, when available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use Level 1 or Level 2 inputs in accordance with GAAP guidance. We obtain a quoted price for each security from third party pricing services, which is derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities. For securities not actively traded, the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of similar instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often\nused in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, and prepayment speeds. We also perform quarterly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value, including confirming the fair values of these securities through observable market prices using an alternative pricing source. If differences are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price (See Note 4 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\nImpairment of Investment Securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 removed the impairment assessment for equity securities at fair value beginning in 2018, and changes in fair value are included in Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Prior to adoption of this standard, when, in the opinion of management, a decline in the fair value of an equity security below its cost is considered to be \"other-than-temporary,\" the equity security's cost is written down to its fair value at the time the other-than-temporary decline is identified. If management has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, the investment is written down to its fair value and the entire impairment is recorded as a realized loss due to credit in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. If management does not have the intent to sell or will not be required to sell the debt security but does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the debt security, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment is bifurcated between credit loss and other loss and recorded as a component of realized gains and losses and in other comprehensive income, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The amount of any write-down is determined by the difference between the cost or amortized cost of the debt security and its fair value at the time the other-than-temporary decline is identified.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe prepare an impairment analysis for goodwill and other intangible assets, whereby we identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events, such as cash flows and profitability. Differences between the assumptions regarding recoverability of carrying value and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740). This update simplifies the accounting for income taxes within ASC Topic 740 by removing certain exceptions and clarifies existing guidance. We have determined that the impact of this new standard is not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIn April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. The amendments in this update represent changes to clarify, correct errors in, or improve the codification within various ASC topics. We will adopt the updates related to Topic 815 when we adopt ASU 2016-13. We will adopt any remaining codification improvements as they become applicable and have determined that the impact of these improvements will not be material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This update removes the disclosure requirements for the amounts of and the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and disclosure of the policy for timing of transfers between levels. This update also removes disclosure requirements for the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, this update adds disclosure requirements for the changes in unrealized gains and losses for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and quantitative information for certain unobservable inputs in Level 3 fair value measurements. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect that this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). This update simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating the performance of Step 2 in the goodwill impairment testing. This update allows the testing to be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge when the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Additionally, this update eliminates the requirements of any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying value to perform Step 2, but requires disclosure of the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit with zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We do not expect that this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments with a methodology that reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. This update requires financial assets (including receivables and reinsurance\nrecoverables) measured at amortized cost to be presented net of an allowance for credit losses. Additionally, this update requires credit losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down, allowing an entity to also record reversals of credit losses in current period net income. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Additionally, in December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This update provides clarification on the effective and transition dates and the exclusion of operating lease receivables from Topic 326. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. This update adds optional transition relief for entities to elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis to increase comparability of similar financial assets. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses which provides clarification on certain aspects of the guidance in ASC 326 including purchased credit-deteriorated (PCD) financial assets, transition relief for troubled debt restructurings, disclosure relief for accrued interest receivables and allows a practical expedient for financial assets secured by collateral maintenance provisions. Upon adoption of this ASU, we will use the Ratings Based Method based on the A.M. Best Average Cumulative Net Impairment Rates in developing the expected credit allowance on reinsurance recoverables. We estimate the total impact to allowances for credit losses on all financial instruments, including premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables, and investments will be immaterial to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn July 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-07, Codification Updates to SEC Sections. This update aligned the guidance in various SEC sections of the codification with the requirements of certain SEC final rules along with other miscellaneous updates, which were effective upon issuance. We adopted these updates where applicable and there was no impact to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements. This update provided clarification, corrected errors in and made minor improvements to the codification within various ASC topics. Many of the amendments in this update had transition guidance with effective dates for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and some amendments in this update did not require transition guidance and became effective upon issuance of this update. We adopted these amendments and there was no impact to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. This update provided entities with an additional and optional transition method to adopt ASU 2016-02 with a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption. This update also provided guidance for a practical expedient that permitted lessors to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease components. Additionally, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases. This update provided additional guidance on the new lease model with improvements in numerous aspects of the guidance in ASC 842 including, but not limited to, implicit rates, reassessment of lease classification, terms and purchase options, investment tax credits, and various other transition guidance. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20, Leases (Topic 842): Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors. This update provided amendments to various lease topics including sales taxes collected from lessees, certain lessor costs paid to third parties, and variable payments for contracts with lease and non-lease components. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases Topics (842) Codification Improvements. The amendments in this update increased transparency and comparability for the recognition of leases and disclosures about leasing transactions. This update provided additional clarity on determining the value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers. This update further clarified the presentation of the statement of cash flows related to lessors that are depository and lending institutions within the scope of Topic 942. Additionally, this update provided guidance on transition disclosures related to leases. We adopted these updates concurrently with ASU 2016-02. See Note 11 regarding the impact of this adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update provided guidance on a new lease model that included the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet. Additionally, the update provided clarity on the definition of a lease and the distinction between finance and operating leases. Furthermore, the update required certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures pertaining to the amounts recorded in the financial statements. This update became effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption was permitted. As a result of the implementation of this standard, we recognized an Operating lease right-of-use asset of $16.8 million and $19.0 million of Lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2019. See Note 11 for additional detail regarding the adoption of this standard.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and results of operations of a Nevada holding company and its insurance subsidiaries.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes thereto, and the financial statement schedules included in Item 8 and Item 15 of this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors described in Item 1A of this report. Our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including the risks described in the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a Nevada holding company. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to select, small businesses in low to medium hazard industries. Workers' compensation insurance is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees' medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation, and/or death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. We provide workers' compensation insurance throughout the United States, with a concentration in California, where nearly one-half of our business is generated. Our revenues are primarily comprised of net premiums earned, net investment income, and net realized and unrealized gains on investments.\nWe target small businesses, as we believe that this market is traditionally characterized by fewer competitors, more attractive pricing, and stronger persistency when compared to the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry in general. We believe we are able to price our policies at levels that are competitive and profitable over the long-term given our expertise in underwriting and claims handling in this market segment. Our underwriting approach is to consistently underwrite small business accounts at appropriate and competitive prices without sacrificing long-term profitability and stability for short-term top-line revenue growth.\nOur calendar year underwriting results have improved over the past several years. This improvement reflects our superior claims handling and the increased pricing flexibility afforded to us through the use of multiple writing companies within states and territorial pricing in California. In addition, our ongoing underwriting initiatives, which are described below, have allowed us to expand our operations while also focusing on under-performing classes of business, as needed.\nPricing on our renewals showed an overall price decrease of 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, versus the rate level in effect on such business a year earlier. We believe that we can continue to write attractive business due to favorable loss costs and frequency trends and the success of our accelerated claims initiatives, despite the competitive market conditions we currently face. Given the strength of our balance sheet, the execution of our underwriting, claims, and investment strategies, we believe that we are well positioned for the current market cycle.\nOn July 31, 2019, we acquired (the Acquisition) PartnerRe Insurance Company of New York (PRNY) from Partner Reinsurance Company of the U.S. (PRUS). We funded the Acquisition with cash on hand. The purchase price was equal to the sum of: (i) $47.6 million, the amount of statutory capital and surplus of PRNY at closing; and (ii) $5.8 million. We did not acquire any employees or ongoing business operations pursuant to the Acquisition.\nPursuant to the purchase agreement, all liabilities and obligations of PRNY existing as of the closing date, whether known or unknown, will be indemnified by PRUS. In addition, PartnerRe Ltd., the parent company of PRUS, has provided us with a guaranty that unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees the full and prompt payment and performance by PRUS of all of its obligations, liabilities and indemnities under the purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. If PRUS and PartnerRe Ltd. were to fail to honor their obligations to us under the purchase agreement, all or a portion of the remaining gross loss and LAE reserves acquired by us pursuant to the Acquisition would become our responsibility.\nSubsequent to completing the Acquisition, PRNY was renamed CIC.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for the three year period ending December 31, 2019 are as follows:\n\nOverview\nOur net income was $157.1 million, $141.3 million, and $101.2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The key factors that affected our financial performance during the previous two years included:\n \u2022 Net premiums earned decreased 4.8% in 2019 and increased 2.0% in 2018, each compared to the previous year; \n \u2022 Losses and LAE decreased 3% in 2019 and 10% in 2018, each compared to the previous year; \n \u2022 Underwriting and general and administrative expenses increased 18% in 2019 and 13% in 2018, each compared to the previous year; \n \u2022 Net investment income increased 8.5% in 2019 and 8.8% in 2018, each compared to the previous year; \n \u2022 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments was $51.1 million, $(13.1) million, and $7.4 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively; and \n \u2022 The statutory Federal income tax rate was 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017.  We continue to execute a number of ongoing business initiatives, including: achieving internal and customer-facing business process excellence; offering quotes and insurance coverage directly to customers through digital insurance solutions; accelerating the settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; utilizing a multi-company pricing platform and territory-specific pricing; developing and implementing new technologies to transform the way insurance agents utilize digital capabilities; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, price, and underwrite profitable classes of business across all of our markets.\nSummary of Consolidated Financial Results\nGross Premiums Written\nGross premiums written were $696.9 million, $748.9 million, and $729.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Period over period changes in gross premiums earned during 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to our Employers segment. See -Summary of Financial Results by Segment -Employers.\nNet Premiums Written\nNet premiums written are gross premiums written less reinsurance premiums ceded.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned are primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums previously written.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\nWe invest in fixed maturity securities, equity securities, other invested assets, short-term investments, and cash equivalents. Net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities, less bank service charges and custodial and portfolio management fees. We have established a high quality/short duration bias in our investment portfolio.\nNet investment income was $88.1 million, $81.2 million, and $74.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the allocation and yield of bank loans and other invested assets. The average pre-tax ending book yield on our invested assets was 3.3%, 3.4%, and 3.1% at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The average ending tax-equivalent yield on our invested assets (which adjusts the book yield of our investments in tax-advantaged securities to an equivalent pre-tax book yield) was 3.5% at each of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nRealized and certain unrealized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original or adjusted cost (equity securities) or amortized cost (fixed maturity securities). Realized losses are also recognized when securities are written down as a result of an other-than-temporary impairment. Changes in fair value of equity securities (for 2019 and 2018) and other invested assets are also included in Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments were $51.1 million, $(13.1) million, and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nNet realized and unrealized gains on investments in 2019 included $46.5 million of net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities, $3.9 million of net realized gains on fixed maturity securities, and $0.7 million of unrealized gains on other invested assets. Net gains on equity securities were largely consistent with the performance of U.S. equity markets. Realized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily related to sales associated with a reallocation of our investment portfolio. Net realized and unrealized losses on investments in 2018 included $11.3 million of net realized and unrealized losses on equity securities and $1.8 million of net realized losses on fixed maturity securities. The net losses on equity securities for 2018 were primarily the result of volatility in equity markets. Net losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily related to the sale of fixed maturity securities resulting from a rebalancing of our investment portfolio, offset by $3.3 million in other-than-temporary impairments of certain fixed maturity securities due to our intent to sell the securities. Net gains on fixed maturity securities were primarily related to the sale of fixed maturity securities resulting from a rebalancing of our investment portfolio. Net realized gains on investments in 2017 included $5.8 million of net realized gains on equity securities and $3.0 million of net realized gains on fixed maturity securities. The net gains were primarily related to sales of municipal securities, whose proceeds were reinvested in taxable fixed maturity securities, and sales of equity securities as part of a routine rebalancing of our equity portfolio. Those gains were partially offset by $1.4 million in other-than temporary impairments of certain fixed maturity and equity securities due to our intent to sell those securities and/or the severity and duration of the change in fair value of those securities. Additional information regarding our Investments is set forth under \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Investments\" and Note 5 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGain on Redemption of Notes Payable\nIn May 2017, we purchased one of EPIC's outstanding notes payable in the amount of $12.0 million for $9.9 million, resulting in a $2.1 million gain.\nOther Income\nOther income consists of net gains on fixed assets, non-investment interest, installment fee revenue, and other miscellaneous income.\nLosses and LAE\nLosses and LAE represents our largest expense item and includes claim payments made, amortization of the Deferred Gain, LPT Reserve Adjustments, LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments, estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods, and costs associated with investigating, defending, and adjusting claims. The quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and LAE, which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques.\nOur indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) continued to decrease year-over-year in 2019 and 2018; however, medical and indemnity costs per claim increased over the same period. These trends are reflected\nin our current accident year loss estimate. Total claims costs have also been reduced by cost savings associated with increased claims settlement activity that continued through 2019. We believe our current accident year loss estimate is adequate; however, ultimate losses will not be known with any certainty for many years. We assume that increasing medical and indemnity cost trends will continue to impact our long-term claims costs and current accident year loss estimate, which may be offset by rate increases. Additional information regarding our reserves for losses and LAE is set forth under \"-Critical Accounting Policies -Reserves for Losses and LAE.\" See also, \"-Summary of Financial Results by Segment -Employers.\"\nCommission Expenses\nCommission expenses include direct commissions to our agents and brokers, including our partnerships and alliances, for the premiums that they produce for us, as well as incentive payments, other marketing costs, and fees. See \"-Summary of Financial Results by Segment -Employers.\"\nUnderwriting and General and Administrative Expenses\nUnderwriting expenses represent those costs that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue, excluding commissions. Direct underwriting expenses, such as premium taxes, policyholder dividends, and those expenses that vary directly with the production of new or renewal business, are recognized as the associated premiums are earned. Indirect underwriting expenses, such as the operating expenses of each of the Company's subsidiaries, do not vary directly with the production of new or renewal business and are recognized as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative expenses of the holding company are excluded in determining the underwriting expense ratios of our reportable segments.\nInterest and Financing Expenses\nInterest and financing expenses include surplus notes interest, letter of credit fees, finance lease interest, and other financing fees.\nOther Expenses\nWe actively invest in technology and systems across our business with a view toward maximizing efficiency, facilitating customer self-service, and creating increased capacity that will allow us to lower our expense ratios while growing premiums. In 2017, we wrote-off $7.5 million of previously capitalized costs relating to the development of information technology capabilities that had not yet been placed in service. This charge was the result of our continual evaluation of ongoing technology initiatives.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOn January 1, 2000, EICN assumed the assets, liabilities, and operations of the Fund pursuant to legislation passed in the 1999 Nevada Legislature (the Privatization). Prior to the Privatization, the Fund was part of the State of Nevada and therefore was not subject to federal income tax. Accordingly, our pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments and Deferred Gain amortization impact our net income but do not change our taxable income.\nIncome tax expense was $36.7 million, $28.2 million ($28.6 million excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 (Enactment)), and $42.8 million ($35.8 million excluding the impact of Enactment) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 18.9%, 16.6% (16.8% excluding the impact of Enactment), and 29.7% (24.9% excluding the impact of Enactment) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nEnactment significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning January 1, 2018. This reduction in the corporate statutory income tax rate required us to re-evaluate certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of the date of Enactment, to reflect the revised income tax rates applicable to future periods.\nTax-advantaged investment income, LPT Reserve Adjustments, LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018, and 35% for 2017 by $4.0 million, $7.4 million, and $14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the reductions were partially offset by a $7.0 million increase in our income tax expense due to the re-evaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of Enactment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we were required to base certain of our income tax estimates and assumptions on incomplete information and/or preliminary interpretations of the effects of Enactment. As a result, we decreased our income tax expense by $0.4 million due to a further evaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor additional information regarding our income tax expense see Note 7 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSummary of Financial Results by Segment\nEMPLOYERS\nThe components of Employers' net income before income taxes are set forth in the following table:\n\nUnderwriting Results\nGross Premiums Written\nGross premiums written were $696.8 million, $748.9 million, and $729.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to decreases in final audit premiums and average rates, as well as declines in new business premiums written in California, partially offset by increases in renewal premiums written across all of our markets. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to increases in new business premiums written, partially offset by declines in renewal business premiums. The increase in new business premiums was primarily driven by higher policy counts and payroll exposure, partially offset by decreases in average rates.\nNet Premiums Written\nNet premiums written were $691.4 million, $742.8 million, and $723.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, which included $5.4 million, $6.1 million, and $6.0 million of reinsurance premiums ceded, respectively.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned were $695.8 million, $731.1 million, and $716.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table shows the percentage change in Employers' in-force premiums, policy count, average policy size, and payroll exposure upon which our premiums are based as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, overall, for California, where nearly 50% of our premiums were generated, and for all other states, excluding California:\n\nLosses and LAE, Commission Expenses, and Underwriting Expenses\nPrior to December 31, 2019, we operated under a single reportable segment and presented our Combined Ratio on that basis, including general and administrative expenses of the holding company expenses and the impact of the LPT. Beginning in 2019, we now present the Combined Ratio for each of our reporting segments on a stand-alone basis and have adjusted all prior periods to conform to this presentation.\nThe following table presents calendar year combined ratios for our Employers segment.\n\nLoss and LAE Ratio. We analyze our loss and LAE ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis.\nThe calendar year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and LAE recorded during the calendar year, regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred, by the net premiums earned during that calendar year. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and LAE established for insured events occurring in the current and prior years. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods.\nThe accident year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing cumulative losses and LAE for reported events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year. The accident year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably. The accident year loss and LAE ratio is based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our GAAP financial information.\nWe analyze our calendar year loss and LAE ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and LAE from all periods, including development (whether favorable or unfavorable) of reserves established in prior periods. In contrast, we analyze our accident year loss and LAE ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and LAE from insured events occurring during that year. The loss and LAE ratios provided in this report are calendar year basis, except where they are expressly identified as accident year loss and LAE ratios.\nThe table below reflects prior accident year loss and LAE reserve adjustments and the impact to loss ratio.\n\nThe decrease in our losses and LAE from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to increased favorable prior accident year loss development of $77.5 million, partially offset by an increase in our current accident year loss estimate. The decrease in our losses\nand LAE from 2017 to 2018 was primarily attributable to increased favorable prior accident year loss development of $66.2 million, which included $65.5 million of favorable development on our voluntary risk business and $0.7 million of favorable development related to our assigned risk business. Favorable prior accident year loss development in each period was the result of our determination that adjustments were necessary to reflect observed favorable paid loss trends, primarily for the 2014 through 2017 accident years, which have been impacted by our internal initiatives to reduce loss costs, including the accelerated claims settlement activity that began in 2014 and that continued through 2019.\nThe increases in our current accident year loss estimate in 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the impact of increased competitive pressures and resulting price decreases across most of our markets; however, our current accident year loss and LAE ratio continues to reflect the impact of key business initiatives, including: an emphasis on the accelerated settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, underwrite, and price profitable classes of business across all of our markets.\nCommission Expense Ratio. The commission expense ratio was 12.7%, 12.9%, and 12.8%, and our commission expenses were $88.1 million, $94.2 million, and $91.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the commission expense ratio for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of decreases in 2019 agency incentive commissions, which were directly impacted by decreases in premiums written. The increase in the commission expense ratio for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of increased levels of agency incentive commissions and an increase in the percentage of business produced by our partnerships and alliances for those years, which are subject to a higher commission rate.\nUnderwriting Expense Ratio. The underwriting expense ratio was 22.0%, 18.5%, and 17.3%, and our underwriting expenses were $153.2 million, $135.0 million, and $123.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our IT related expense increased $4.9 million, our professional fees increased $6.0 million, and our compensation-related expenses increased $4.3 million, each as compared to 2018. These increases were largely the result of our aggressive development and implementation of new digital technologies and capabilities. Additionally, our bad debt expense increased $3.5 million compared to 2018, mainly as a result of an increase in the amount of premiums receivable relating to 2018 policy year final audits that were deemed uncollectible in 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our compensation-related expenses increased $3.4 million, our professional fees increased $3.2 million, our bad debt expense increased $1.4 million, and our premium tax and assessments increased $1.4 million, each as compared to 2017.\nUnderwriting Income\nUnderwriting income for our Employers segment was $75.9 million, $110.6 million, and $72.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Underwriting income or loss is determined by deducting losses and LAE, commission expense, and underwriting expenses from net premiums earned.\nNon-Underwriting Income and Expenses\nFor a further discussion of non-underwriting related income and expenses, including Net Investment Income and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments, Gain on Redemption of Notes Payable, Other Income, Interest and Financing Expenses, and Other Expenses see \"-Results of Operations -Summary of Consolidated Financial Results.\"\nCERITY\nThe components of Cerity's net loss before income taxes are set forth in the following table:\n\nUnderwriting Results\nGross Premiums Written and Net Premiums Written\nGross premiums written and net premiums written were $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cerity had no premiums written prior to 2019.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned were less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nUnderwriting Expenses\nUnderwriting expenses for our Certity segment were $16.0 million, $5.9 million, and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes thereto, and the financial statement schedules included in Item 8 and Item 15 of this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors described in Item 1A of this report. Our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including the risks described in the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a Nevada holding company. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to select, small businesses in low to medium hazard industries. Workers' compensation insurance is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees' medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation, and/or death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. We provide workers' compensation insurance throughout the United States, with a concentration in California, where nearly one-half of our business is generated. Our revenues are primarily comprised of net premiums earned, net investment income, and net realized and unrealized gains on investments.\nWe target small businesses, as we believe that this market is traditionally characterized by fewer competitors, more attractive pricing, and stronger persistency when compared to the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry in general. We believe we are able to price our policies at levels that are competitive and profitable over the long-term given our expertise in underwriting and claims handling in this market segment. Our underwriting approach is to consistently underwrite small business accounts at appropriate and competitive prices without sacrificing long-term profitability and stability for short-term top-line revenue growth.\nOur calendar year underwriting results have improved over the past several years. This improvement reflects our superior claims handling and the increased pricing flexibility afforded to us through the use of multiple writing companies within states and territorial pricing in California. In addition, our ongoing underwriting initiatives, which are described below, have allowed us to expand our operations while also focusing on under-performing classes of business, as needed.\nPricing on our renewals showed an overall price decrease of 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, versus the rate level in effect on such business a year earlier. We believe that we can continue to write attractive business due to favorable loss costs and frequency trends and the success of our accelerated claims initiatives, despite the competitive market conditions we currently face. Given the strength of our balance sheet, the execution of our underwriting, claims, and investment strategies, we believe that we are well positioned for the current market cycle.\nOn July 31, 2019, we acquired (the Acquisition) PartnerRe Insurance Company of New York (PRNY) from Partner Reinsurance Company of the U.S. (PRUS). We funded the Acquisition with cash on hand. The purchase price was equal to the sum of: (i) $47.6 million, the amount of statutory capital and surplus of PRNY at closing; and (ii) $5.8 million. We did not acquire any employees or ongoing business operations pursuant to the Acquisition.\nPursuant to the purchase agreement, all liabilities and obligations of PRNY existing as of the closing date, whether known or unknown, will be indemnified by PRUS. In addition, PartnerRe Ltd., the parent company of PRUS, has provided us with a guaranty that unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees the full and prompt payment and performance by PRUS of all of its obligations, liabilities and indemnities under the purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. If PRUS and PartnerRe Ltd. were to fail to honor their obligations to us under the purchase agreement, all or a portion of the remaining gross loss and LAE reserves acquired by us pursuant to the Acquisition would become our responsibility.\nSubsequent to completing the Acquisition, PRNY was renamed CIC.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for the three year period ending December 31, 2019 are as follows:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>691.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>723.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>731.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments\n</td> <td>51.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on redemption of notes payable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>835.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>365.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>376.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expense\n</td> <td>88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting and general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>187.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and financing expenses\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>642.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>657.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before income taxes\n</td> <td>193.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nOur net income was $157.1 million, $141.3 million, and $101.2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The key factors that affected our financial performance during the previous two years included:\n \u2022 Net premiums earned decreased 4.8% in 2019 and increased 2.0% in 2018, each compared to the previous year; \n \u2022 Losses and LAE decreased 3% in 2019 and 10% in 2018, each compared to the previous year; \n \u2022 Underwriting and general and administrative expenses increased 18% in 2019 and 13% in 2018, each compared to the previous year; \n \u2022 Net investment income increased 8.5% in 2019 and 8.8% in 2018, each compared to the previous year; \n \u2022 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments was $51.1 million, $(13.1) million, and $7.4 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively; and \n \u2022 The statutory Federal income tax rate was 21% in 2019 and 2018 and 35% in 2017.  We continue to execute a number of ongoing business initiatives, including: achieving internal and customer-facing business process excellence; offering quotes and insurance coverage directly to customers through digital insurance solutions; accelerating the settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; utilizing a multi-company pricing platform and territory-specific pricing; developing and implementing new technologies to transform the way insurance agents utilize digital capabilities; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, price, and underwrite profitable classes of business across all of our markets.\nSummary of Consolidated Financial Results\nGross Premiums Written\nGross premiums written were $696.9 million, $748.9 million, and $729.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Period over period changes in gross premiums earned during 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to our Employers segment. See -Summary of Financial Results by Segment -Employers.\nNet Premiums Written\nNet premiums written are gross premiums written less reinsurance premiums ceded.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned are primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums previously written.\nNet Investment Income and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\nWe invest in fixed maturity securities, equity securities, other invested assets, short-term investments, and cash equivalents. Net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities, less bank service charges and custodial and portfolio management fees. We have established a high quality/short duration bias in our investment portfolio.\nNet investment income was $88.1 million, $81.2 million, and $74.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the allocation and yield of bank loans and other invested assets. The average pre-tax ending book yield on our invested assets was 3.3%, 3.4%, and 3.1% at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The average ending tax-equivalent yield on our invested assets (which adjusts the book yield of our investments in tax-advantaged securities to an equivalent pre-tax book yield) was 3.5% at each of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nRealized and certain unrealized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original or adjusted cost (equity securities) or amortized cost (fixed maturity securities). Realized losses are also recognized when securities are written down as a result of an other-than-temporary impairment. Changes in fair value of equity securities (for 2019 and 2018) and other invested assets are also included in Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments were $51.1 million, $(13.1) million, and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nNet realized and unrealized gains on investments in 2019 included $46.5 million of net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities, $3.9 million of net realized gains on fixed maturity securities, and $0.7 million of unrealized gains on other invested assets. Net gains on equity securities were largely consistent with the performance of U.S. equity markets. Realized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily related to sales associated with a reallocation of our investment portfolio. Net realized and unrealized losses on investments in 2018 included $11.3 million of net realized and unrealized losses on equity securities and $1.8 million of net realized losses on fixed maturity securities. The net losses on equity securities for 2018 were primarily the result of volatility in equity markets. Net losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily related to the sale of fixed maturity securities resulting from a rebalancing of our investment portfolio, offset by $3.3 million in other-than-temporary impairments of certain fixed maturity securities due to our intent to sell the securities. Net gains on fixed maturity securities were primarily related to the sale of fixed maturity securities resulting from a rebalancing of our investment portfolio. Net realized gains on investments in 2017 included $5.8 million of net realized gains on equity securities and $3.0 million of net realized gains on fixed maturity securities. The net gains were primarily related to sales of municipal securities, whose proceeds were reinvested in taxable fixed maturity securities, and sales of equity securities as part of a routine rebalancing of our equity portfolio. Those gains were partially offset by $1.4 million in other-than temporary impairments of certain fixed maturity and equity securities due to our intent to sell those securities and/or the severity and duration of the change in fair value of those securities. Additional information regarding our Investments is set forth under \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Investments\" and Note 5 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGain on Redemption of Notes Payable\nIn May 2017, we purchased one of EPIC's outstanding notes payable in the amount of $12.0 million for $9.9 million, resulting in a $2.1 million gain.\nOther Income\nOther income consists of net gains on fixed assets, non-investment interest, installment fee revenue, and other miscellaneous income.\nLosses and LAE\nLosses and LAE represents our largest expense item and includes claim payments made, amortization of the Deferred Gain, LPT Reserve Adjustments, LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments, estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods, and costs associated with investigating, defending, and adjusting claims. The quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and LAE, which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques.\nOur indemnity claims frequency (the number of claims expressed as a percentage of payroll) continued to decrease year-over-year in 2019 and 2018; however, medical and indemnity costs per claim increased over the same period. These trends are reflected\nin our current accident year loss estimate. Total claims costs have also been reduced by cost savings associated with increased claims settlement activity that continued through 2019. We believe our current accident year loss estimate is adequate; however, ultimate losses will not be known with any certainty for many years. We assume that increasing medical and indemnity cost trends will continue to impact our long-term claims costs and current accident year loss estimate, which may be offset by rate increases. Additional information regarding our reserves for losses and LAE is set forth under \"-Critical Accounting Policies -Reserves for Losses and LAE.\" See also, \"-Summary of Financial Results by Segment -Employers.\"\nCommission Expenses\nCommission expenses include direct commissions to our agents and brokers, including our partnerships and alliances, for the premiums that they produce for us, as well as incentive payments, other marketing costs, and fees. See \"-Summary of Financial Results by Segment -Employers.\"\nUnderwriting and General and Administrative Expenses\nUnderwriting expenses represent those costs that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue, excluding commissions. Direct underwriting expenses, such as premium taxes, policyholder dividends, and those expenses that vary directly with the production of new or renewal business, are recognized as the associated premiums are earned. Indirect underwriting expenses, such as the operating expenses of each of the Company's subsidiaries, do not vary directly with the production of new or renewal business and are recognized as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative expenses of the holding company are excluded in determining the underwriting expense ratios of our reportable segments.\nInterest and Financing Expenses\nInterest and financing expenses include surplus notes interest, letter of credit fees, finance lease interest, and other financing fees.\nOther Expenses\nWe actively invest in technology and systems across our business with a view toward maximizing efficiency, facilitating customer self-service, and creating increased capacity that will allow us to lower our expense ratios while growing premiums. In 2017, we wrote-off $7.5 million of previously capitalized costs relating to the development of information technology capabilities that had not yet been placed in service. This charge was the result of our continual evaluation of ongoing technology initiatives.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOn January 1, 2000, EICN assumed the assets, liabilities, and operations of the Fund pursuant to legislation passed in the 1999 Nevada Legislature (the Privatization). Prior to the Privatization, the Fund was part of the State of Nevada and therefore was not subject to federal income tax. Accordingly, our pre-Privatization loss and LAE reserve adjustments, LPT Reserve Adjustments and Deferred Gain amortization impact our net income but do not change our taxable income.\nIncome tax expense was $36.7 million, $28.2 million ($28.6 million excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 (Enactment)), and $42.8 million ($35.8 million excluding the impact of Enactment) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 18.9%, 16.6% (16.8% excluding the impact of Enactment), and 29.7% (24.9% excluding the impact of Enactment) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nEnactment significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning January 1, 2018. This reduction in the corporate statutory income tax rate required us to re-evaluate certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of the date of Enactment, to reflect the revised income tax rates applicable to future periods.\nTax-advantaged investment income, LPT Reserve Adjustments, LPT Contingent Commission Adjustments, Deferred Gain amortization and certain other adjustments reduced our income tax expense computed at a statutory rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018, and 35% for 2017 by $4.0 million, $7.4 million, and $14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the reductions were partially offset by a $7.0 million increase in our income tax expense due to the re-evaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of Enactment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we were required to base certain of our income tax estimates and assumptions on incomplete information and/or preliminary interpretations of the effects of Enactment. As a result, we decreased our income tax expense by $0.4 million due to a further evaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor additional information regarding our income tax expense see Note 7 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSummary of Financial Results by Segment\nEMPLOYERS\nThe components of Employers' net income before income taxes are set forth in the following table:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>691.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>723.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>731.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>716.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>84.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on redemption of notes payable\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>828.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>796.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>378.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expense\n</td> <td>88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expenses\n</td> <td>153.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and financing expenses\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>620.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>652.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>89.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnderwriting Results\nGross Premiums Written\nGross premiums written were $696.8 million, $748.9 million, and $729.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to decreases in final audit premiums and average rates, as well as declines in new business premiums written in California, partially offset by increases in renewal premiums written across all of our markets. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to increases in new business premiums written, partially offset by declines in renewal business premiums. The increase in new business premiums was primarily driven by higher policy counts and payroll exposure, partially offset by decreases in average rates.\nNet Premiums Written\nNet premiums written were $691.4 million, $742.8 million, and $723.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, which included $5.4 million, $6.1 million, and $6.0 million of reinsurance premiums ceded, respectively.\nNet Premiums Earned\nNet premiums earned were $695.8 million, $731.1 million, and $716.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table shows the percentage change in Employers' in-force premiums, policy count, average policy size, and payroll exposure upon which our premiums are based as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, overall, for California, where nearly 50% of our premiums were generated, and for all other states, excluding California:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n2019 Over 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change\n2018 Over 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Overall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>All Other States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Overall\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>California\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>All Other States\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force premiums\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force policy count\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average in-force policy size\n</td> <td>(7.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force payroll exposure\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLosses and LAE, Commission Expenses, and Underwriting Expenses\nPrior to December 31, 2019, we operated under a single reportable segment and presented our Combined Ratio on that basis, including general and administrative expenses of the holding company expenses and the impact of the LPT. Beginning in 2019, we now present the Combined Ratio for each of our reporting segments on a stand-alone basis and have adjusted all prior periods to conform to this presentation.\nThe following table presents calendar year combined ratios for our Employers segment.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and LAE ratio\n</td> <td>54.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission expense ratio\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>89.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss and LAE Ratio. We analyze our loss and LAE ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis.\nThe calendar year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and LAE recorded during the calendar year, regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred, by the net premiums earned during that calendar year. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and LAE established for insured events occurring in the current and prior years. The calendar year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods.\nThe accident year loss and LAE ratio is calculated by dividing cumulative losses and LAE for reported events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year. The accident year loss and LAE ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably. The accident year loss and LAE ratio is based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our GAAP financial information.\nWe analyze our calendar year loss and LAE ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and LAE from all periods, including development (whether favorable or unfavorable) of reserves established in prior periods. In contrast, we analyze our accident year loss and LAE ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and LAE from insured events occurring during that year. The loss and LAE ratios provided in this report are calendar year basis, except where they are expressly identified as accident year loss and LAE ratios.\nThe table below reflects prior accident year loss and LAE reserve adjustments and the impact to loss ratio.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prior accident year favorable development, net\n</td> <td>77.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current accident year losses and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>456.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>457.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current accident year loss ratio\n</td> <td>65.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in our losses and LAE from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to increased favorable prior accident year loss development of $77.5 million, partially offset by an increase in our current accident year loss estimate. The decrease in our losses\nand LAE from 2017 to 2018 was primarily attributable to increased favorable prior accident year loss development of $66.2 million, which included $65.5 million of favorable development on our voluntary risk business and $0.7 million of favorable development related to our assigned risk business. Favorable prior accident year loss development in each period was the result of our determination that adjustments were necessary to reflect observed favorable paid loss trends, primarily for the 2014 through 2017 accident years, which have been impacted by our internal initiatives to reduce loss costs, including the accelerated claims settlement activity that began in 2014 and that continued through 2019.\nThe increases in our current accident year loss estimate in 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the impact of increased competitive pressures and resulting price decreases across most of our markets; however, our current accident year loss and LAE ratio continues to reflect the impact of key business initiatives, including: an emphasis on the accelerated settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, underwrite, and price profitable classes of business across all of our markets.\nCommission Expense Ratio. The commission expense ratio was 12.7%, 12.9%, and 12.8%, and our commission expenses were $88.1 million, $94.2 million, and $91.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the commission expense ratio for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of decreases in 2019 agency incentive commissions, which were directly impacted by decreases in premiums written. The increase in the commission expense ratio for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of increased levels of agency incentive commissions and an increase in the percentage of business produced by our partnerships and alliances for those years, which are subject to a higher commission rate.\nUnderwriting Expense Ratio. The underwriting expense ratio was 22.0%, 18.5%, and 17.3%, and our underwriting expenses were $153.2 million, $135.0 million, and $123.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our IT related expense increased $4.9 million, our professional fees increased $6.0 million, and our compensation-related expenses increased $4.3 million, each as compared to 2018. These increases were largely the result of our aggressive development and implementation of new digital technologies and capabilities. Additionally, our bad debt expense increased $3.5 million compared to 2018, mainly as a result of an increase in the amount of premiums receivable relating to 2018 policy year final audits that were deemed uncollectible in 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our compensation-related expenses increased $3.4 million, our professional fees increased $3.2 million, our bad debt expense increased $1.4 million, and our premium tax and assessments increased $1.4 million, each as compared to 2017.\nUnderwriting Income\nUnderwriting income for our Employers segment was $75.9 million, $110.6 million, and $72.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Underwriting income or loss is determined by deducting losses and LAE, commission expense, and underwriting expenses from net premiums earned.\nNon-Underwriting Income and Expenses\nFor a further discussion of non-underwriting related income and expenses, including Net Investment Income and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments, Gain on Redemption of Notes Payable, Other Income, Interest and Financing Expenses, and Other Expenses see \"-Results of Operations -Summary of Consolidated Financial Results.\"\nCERITY\nThe components of Cerity's net loss before income taxes are set forth in the following table:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums written\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized gains on investments\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting expenses\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/m - not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnderwriting Results\nGross Premiums Written and Net Premiums Written\nGross premiums written and net premiums written were $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
