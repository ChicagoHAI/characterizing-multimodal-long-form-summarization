Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should carefully read the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a patient-centered, health intelligence company with a mission to use artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning to enable personalized medicine for all. By leveraging leading data scientists and technology, our platform powers remarkable and unique insights that transform the practice of medicine including how disease is diagnosed, treated, and prevented.\nWe were established out of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai or ISMMS, and commenced operations in June 2017 as a commercial entity that could effectively engage diverse patient populations and health care institutions at scale. We have since established and deployed our comprehensive and integrated genomic and clinical\ndata platform and established a mature diagnostic testing business. We now maintain a database that includes more than 12 million de-identified individual clinical records, many with genomic profiles. We also manage a data asset over 47 petabytes in size, that has been expanding at more than 1 petabyte per month with an accelerating growth rate.\nCurrently, we derive the majority of our revenue from our diagnostic test solutions. Our diagnostic business generates revenue and engages with healthcare professionals working with patients primarily through our Women's Health and Oncology solutions.\nOur Women's Health solutions sequence and analyze an industry-leading number of genes and use interpretive information tools to translate raw sequencing and clinical data efficiently and accurately into digestible clinical reports that guide decision-making by patients and physicians. Our Oncology diagnostic solutions feature both somatic tumor profiling and hereditary cancer screenings, along with a foundational whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing approach. Our Sema4 Signal Hereditary Cancer solution determines if a patient carries an inherited genetic change that increases the risk of cancer or informs on cancer treatment. We believe our Signal Whole Exome and Transcriptome solution is one of the most comprehensive molecular profiling solutions from a commercial entity to receive New York State approval. Beginning in May of 2020, we also expanded our diagnostic testing services to include testing for the presence of COVID-19, which we intend to discontinue by March 31, 2022.\nWe have also expanded beyond diagnostic testing to enter into service agreements with third parties to provide diagnostic testing, research, and related data aggregation reporting services. We have established and continue to seek strategic relationships with pharmaceutical and biotech, or Biopharma, companies to enable innovation across the entire drug lifecycle, from next-generation drug discovery and development, to post-market efficacy surveillance, to informing on bioavailability, toxicity, tolerability, and other features critical to drug development.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe several important factors have impacted, and will continue to impact, our performance and results of operations. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must address. See the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for more information.\nNumber of resulted tests\nWe historically reported both accessioned and resulted tests as important factors impacting our performance. A test is resulted once the appropriate workflow is completed and details are provided to the ordered patients or healthcare professional for reviews, which corresponds to the timing of our revenue recognition. We believe the number of resulted tests in any period is more important and useful to our investors because it directly correlates with long-term patient relationships and the size of our genomic database. Therefore, we do not plan to report the number of accessioned tests.\nSuccess obtaining and maintaining reimbursement\nOur ability to increase the number of billable tests and our revenue therefrom will depend on our success in achieving reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors. Reimbursement by a payor may depend on several factors, including a payor's determination that a test is appropriate, medically necessary, cost-effective, and has received prior authorization. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to provide coverage for our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse us for a test, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process.\nIn cases where we or our partners have established reimbursement rates with third-party payors, we face additional challenges in complying with their procedural requirements for reimbursement. These requirements often vary from payor to payor and are reassessed by third-party payors regularly. As a result, in the past we have needed additional time and resources to comply with the requirements.\nWe expect to continue to focus our resources on increasing the adoption of, and expanding coverage and reimbursement for, our current and any future tests we may develop or acquire. If we fail to expand and maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue and our future business prospects may be adversely affected.\nAbility to lower the costs associated with performing our tests\nReducing the costs associated with performing our diagnostic tests is both our focus and a strategic objective. We source, and will continue to source, components of our diagnostic testing workflows from third parties. We also rely upon third-party service providers for data storage and workflow management.\nIncreasing adoption of our services by existing and new customers\nOur performance depends on our ability to retain and broaden the adoption of our services with existing customers as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our success in retaining and gaining new customers is dependent on the market's confidence in our services and the willingness of customers to continue to seek more comprehensive and integrated genomic and clinical data insights.\nInvestment in platform innovation to support commercial growth\nWe are seeking to leverage and deploy our Centrellis and Traversa platforms to develop a pipeline of future disease-specific research and diagnostic and therapeutic products and services. We have limited experience in the development or commercialization of clinical or research products in connection with our database and our Centrellis platform.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Our business faces changing technologies, shifting provider and patient needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant, and useful products, services, and technologies on time. As our business evolves, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including investments through acquisitions and partnerships. These investments are critical to the enhancement of our current diagnostics and health information and data science technologies from which existing and new service offerings are derived.\nWe expect to incur significant expenses to advance these development efforts, but they may not be successful. New potential services may fail at any stage of development and, if we determine that any of our current or future services are unlikely to succeed, we may abandon them without any return on our investment. If we are unsuccessful in developing additional services, our growth potential may be impaired.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use the following key financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. These key financial and operating metrics should be read in conjunction with the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report.\nThe principal focus of our commercial operations is to offer our diagnostic tests through both our direct sales force and laboratory distribution partners. Test volume correlates with genomic database size and long-term patient relationships. Thus, test volumes drive database diversity and enable potential identification of variants of unknown significance and population-specific insights. The number of tests resulted is a key indicator that we use to assess the operational efficiency of our business. Once the appropriate workflow is completed, the test is resulted and details are provided to ordered patients or healthcare professionals for reviews.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we resulted 709,942 tests in our laboratories, 418,053 tests of which were for COVID-19, compared to the period ended December 31, 2020, in which we resulted approximately 540,407 tests in our laboratories, 332,764 of which were for COVID-19. This 31% increase in resulted volume from 2020 to 2021 largely resulted from newly entered service agreements for COVID-19 testing as well as an increase in non-COVID-19 institutional testing. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we resulted approximately 155,497 tests in our laboratories, none of which were for COVID-19. The 248% increase in resulted volume from 2019 to 2020 largely resulted from newly entered service agreements for COVID-19 testing, offset by a slowdown in the base diagnostic business during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic given that many of our customers, including hospitals and clinics, had suspended non-emergency appointments and services.\nAs discussed above, we no longer report the number of accessioned tests as a key performance indicator because the number of resulted tests more directly correlates with long-term patient relationships and the size of our genomic database.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, an extensive impact on the global health and economic environments since the initial outbreak in March 2020.\nBeginning in April 2020, our diagnostic test volumes decreased significantly as compared to the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related limitations and priorities across the healthcare system. In response, beginning in May 2020, we entered into several service agreements with state governments and healthcare institutions to provide testing for the presence of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 test volumes grew significantly from the introduction of the service offering through the remainder of 2020 and further increased in 2021. To support the rapid expansion of COVID-19 test volumes, we increased our workforce through both temporary contractors and employees. In addition, while most of our revenues from genetic testing rely upon reimbursements from third party payors, healthcare institutions, and individuals, the majority of our COVID-19 test revenues rely upon reimbursements from state governments and healthcare institutions. In addition, COVID-19 testing yields lower revenues per tests and incurs lower costs to perform each test. We have also experienced a slowdown in receivable collections since the onset of the pandemic, but do not expect those collection trends to continue.\nAs part of our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented various strategies to mitigate operating risks, reduce costs and improve cash collections. We have made significant advance purchases of test-related inventory in order to reduce the risk of potential business interruptions related to supply chain disruption. We also contracted with third-party vendors to collect and test COVID-19 samples to reduce operating risks related to employee health. Temporary COVID-19 austerity measures included cancellation of the 2020 annual merit compensation increase, temporary salary reductions from May through July 2020 and deferral of the 401(k) employer match from May through December 2020. The employer match was reinstated in January 2021, and the deferred portion was funded on March 9, 2021. To support our sales employees with commission-based compensation structure, we implemented temporary minimum commissions during the second quarter of 2020. No such minimums were in place in any quarter after the second quarter nor are any such minimums expected to be implemented again in the near term. No employee layoffs were implemented as part of these austerity measures.\nAs conditions improve, we are focused on overhauling our revenue cycle, and as part of transformational activities hired a Chief Revenue Officer and established a revenue cycle Center of Excellence. As part of our efforts to improve our collection efficiency and overall financial health, we are also undergoing various process transformations within the Order-to-Cash and Procure-to-Pay cycles.\nWhile test volumes have since improved, we continue to experience changes in the mix of tests due to the impact of the COVID-19 and its variants. We anticipate that demand for COVID-19 tests will decrease as vaccines continue to be developed and deployed to the general population. For this reason, we announced in December 2021 that we had decided to discontinue COVID-19 testing services by March 31, 2022 and began notifying our COVID-19 testing solutions customers of this decision. We intend to dedicate all of our efforts and resources to our core mission to transform healthcare by using artificial intelligence to enable the delivery of precision medicine as the standard of care, and do not expect declines for our other revenue streams during 2022. The full extent to which\nthe COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 or its variants, the actions taken to contain it or treat it and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets and supply chains. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the foreseeable future.\nIn March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was signed into law which was a stimulus bill that, among other things, provided assistance to qualifying businesses and individuals and included funding for the healthcare system. We received $5.4 million in 2020 as part of the stimulus, comprised of $2.6 million received under the Provider Relief Fund, or PRF, distribution and $2.8 million received under the Employee Retention Credit, or ERC, distribution. During 2021, we received an additional $5.6 million under the PRF distribution.\nPRF distributions to healthcare providers are not loans and will not be required to be repaid; however, as a condition to receiving these payments, providers must agree to certain terms and conditions and submit sufficient documentation demonstrating that the funds are being used for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have concluded it is probable that all terms and conditions associated with the PRF distribution have been met. As a result, we recorded the PRF distributions in other income (expense), net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the periods in which we received the distributions.\nERC distributions are refundable tax credits for 50% of qualified wages paid to employees during the pandemic. A company is eligible for the ERC if it has not received a Paycheck Protection Program loan under the Cares Act and (1) its operations have been fully or partially suspended because of COVID-19 or (2) its gross receipts in a calendar quarter in 2020 declined by more than 50% from the same period in 2019. At the time of applying for the ERC, we concluded that it was reasonably possible the eligibility requirements would be met; however, due to a change in circumstances, we are re-evaluating our position. As such, we deferred the recognition of the ERC distribution and recorded the proceeds in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAt this time, we are not certain of the availability, extent or impact of any future relief provided under the CARES Act or other stimulus initiatives.\nRecent Developments\nIn January 2022, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Orion Merger Sub I, Inc., or Merger Sub I, and Orion Merger Sub II, LLC, or Merger Sub II, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, with GeneDx, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, or GeneDx, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc., or OPKO, GeneDx Holding 2, Inc., or Holdco, and OPKO to acquire 100% of GeneDx (which we refer to as the Acquisition\u201d). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, we will pay consideration to OPKO for the Acquisition of (i) $150 million in cash at the closing of the Acquisition, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement, (ii) 80 million shares of our Class A common stock to be issued at the closing of the Acquisition and (iii) up to $150 million payable following the closing of the Acquisition, if certain revenue-based milestones are achieved for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. These milestone payments, if and to the extent earned under the terms of the Merger Agreement, will be satisfied through the payment and/or issuance of a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock (valued at $4.86 per share), with such mix to be determined in our sole discretion.\nThe completion of the Acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions (which, as of the date of this report, have not been met), including certain regulatory and other third party approvals, the consummation of a pre-closing restructuring and certain approvals of our stockholders related to the Acquisition). The Acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2022. If this pending Acquisition is consummated, consistent with our business model, we expect to leverage the combined health information database of Sema4 and GeneDx to partner with additional health systems and biopharma companies to transform patient care and therapeutic development and enable precision medicine for all.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into subscription agreements with certain institutional investors, pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, these investors have collectively subscribed for 50 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $200 million (which we refer to as the Acquisition PIPE Investment\u201d). The Acquisition PIPE Investment will be consummated substantially concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from diagnostic testing services, which primarily relate to Women's Health, Oncology and COVID-19. We also recognize revenue from collaboration service agreements with Biopharma companies and other third parties pursuant to which we provide diagnostic testing and related data aggregation reporting services. As discussed above, in December 2021, we announced that we decided to discontinue COVID-19 testing services by March 31, 2022 and begun notifying its COVID-19 testing solutions customers of this decision.\nWe recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nDiagnostic Test Revenue\nWe primarily generate revenue from performing diagnostic testing services for three groups of customers: healthcare professionals working with patients with third-party insurance coverage or without third-party insurance coverage or those who elect to self-pay; and institutional clients, such as hospitals, clinics, state governments and reference laboratories. Customers are billed upon delivery of test results. The amount of revenue recognized for diagnostic testing services depends on a number of factors, such as contracted rates with our customers and third-party insurance providers, insurance reimbursement policies, payor mix, historical collection experience, price concessions and other business and economic conditions and trends. To date, the majority of our diagnostic test revenue has been earned from orders received for patients with third-party insurance coverage.\nOur ability to increase our diagnostic test revenue will depend on our ability to increase our market penetration, obtain contracted reimbursement coverage from third-party payers, enter into contracts with institutions, and increase our reimbursement rate for tests performed.\nOther Revenue\nWe generate revenue from providing diagnostic testing and related data aggregation reporting services under both short-term and long-term project-based collaboration service agreements with third parties. The terms of these contracts generally include non-refundable upfront payments, which we record as contract liabilities, and variable payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones during the contract term.\nWith respect to existing collaboration service agreements, our revenue may fluctuate period to period due to the pattern in which we may deliver our services, our ability to achieve milestones, the timing of costs incurred, changes in estimates of total anticipated costs that we expect to incur during the contract period, and other events that may not be within our control. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to enter into contracts with third-party partners.\nCost of Services\nThe cost of services reflect the aggregate costs incurred in performing services. These costs include expenses for reagents and laboratory supplies, personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries and benefits) and stock-based compensation for employees directly involved in revenue generating activities, shipping and handling fees, costs of third-party reference lab testing and phlebotomy services and allocated genetic counseling, facility and IT costs associated with delivery services. Allocated costs include depreciation of laboratory equipment, facility occupancy, and information technology costs. The cost of services are recorded as the services are performed.\nWe expect the cost of services to generally increase in line with the anticipated growth in diagnostic testing volume and services we provide under our collaboration service agreements. However, we expect the cost per test to decrease over the long term due to the efficiencies we may gain from improved utilization of our laboratory capacity, automation, and other value engineering initiatives. These expected reductions may be offset by new tests which often have a higher cost per test during the introductory phases before we can gain efficiencies. The cost per test may fluctuate from period to period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and future test offerings. These costs are principally associated with our efforts to develop the software we use to analyze data and process customer orders. These costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries and benefits), stock-based compensation for employees performing research and development, innovation and product development activities, costs of reagents and laboratory supplies, costs of consultants and third-party services, equipment and related depreciation expenses, non-capitalizable software development costs, research funding to our research partners as part of research and development agreements and allocated facility and information technology costs associated with genomics medical research. Research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred and certain non-refundable advanced payments provided to our research partners are expensed as the related activities are performed.\nWe generally expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as we innovate and expand the application of our platforms. However, we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of our development and commercialization efforts and fluctuations in our compensation-related charges.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries, and benefits) and stock-based compensation for employees performing commercial sales, account management, marketing, and allocation of genetic counseling services related to medical education. Selling and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe generally expect our selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our commercial sales and marketing and counseling teams and increase marketing activities. However, we expect selling and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, subject to fluctuations from period to period due to the timing and magnitude of these expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries and benefits) and stock-based compensation for employees in executive leadership, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, strategy and other administrative functions. In addition, these expenses include office occupancy and information technology costs. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe generally expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase headcount and incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to legal, accounting, and regulatory matters; maintaining compliance with requirements of the Nasdaq and of the SEC; director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations. We expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as revenue increases, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to fluctuations in our compensation-related charges.\nRelated Party Expenses\nRelated party expenses primarily consist of amounts incurred in connection with transactions occurred with ISMMS for expenses under our transition services agreement, or TSA, with ISMMS which expired at the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2021, and other service agreements. Additional information can be found in our consolidated financial statements in Note 7, Related Party Transactions\u201d included within this Annual Report.\nWe generally expect related party expenses to decrease as we establish our own internal and external resources to fulfill the administrative and other services we have historically procured from ISMMS.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of interest earned on money market funds.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs related to our capital leases and our long-term debt arrangements, including unused line fee and the amortization of deferred transaction costs related to the loan and security agreement entered into with Silicon Valley Bank to provide a $125 million revolving credit facility described elsewhere in this report.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net primarily consists of funding received under the CARES Act. We recognized $2.6 million of the $5.4 million of funding received under the CARES Act as other income, net on the statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2020. We recognized $5.6 million of additional funding received under the CARES Act during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the amount is included in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the loss incurred due to early payment penalties recognized upon extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million is included in other income, net.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of consolidated operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented below.\nCertain expenses were previously misclassified as cost of services and they are now reported as selling and marketing. The adjustment is reflected in the amounts reported below for years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 (Restated) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diagnostic test revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>205,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,351 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>7,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,971 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>212,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,322 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>228,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross (loss) profit\n</td> <td>(16,602) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,026 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>105,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,700 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>112,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,183 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>205,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,742 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related party expenses\n</td> <td>5,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,395 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(446,149) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(241,994) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Change in fair market value of warrant and earn-out contingent liabilities </td> <td>198,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>506 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(2,835) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,474) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>5,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,622 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>200,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>654 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(245,390) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(241,340) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>(245,390) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(241,340) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redeemable convertible preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(245,390) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(241,340) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td>2020 to 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diagnostic test revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>205,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>7,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>179,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased by $32.9 million, or 18%, to $212.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $179.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDiagnostic test revenue increased by $29.7 million, or 17%, to $205.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $175.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to a 135% increase in oncology test volumes, a 38% increase in women's health test volumes and an overall increase in volumes of 31%, partially offset by the change in the mix of tests performed and reduced reimbursement rates. COVID-19 testing was introduced in May of 2020, which had a lower impact on total test volume during the year\nended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 (with COVID-19 test volumes growing 26% year over year) .\nOther revenue increased by $3.1 million, or 79%, to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in collaboration service activities due to the execution of third-party contracts which generated $3.7 million more in revenues in 2021 compared to 2020. This was partially offset by reduced revenues recognized related to an existing third-party contract by $0.8 million.\nCost of Services (2020 amount restated)\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td>2020 to 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>175,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of services increased by $53.5 million, or 31%, to $228.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $175.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The decrease was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of tests performed coupled with reduced reimbursement rates. The Company experienced an increase in volumes of 248%, primarily driven by the introduction of COVID-19 testing in May 2020. Despite these increased volumes, diagnostic test revenue decreased due to lower pricing on COVID-19 testing relative to other diagnostic tests and an overall decrease in average pricing on Women's Health and Oncology testing.\nOther revenue decreased by $0.5 million, or 12%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the completion of one significant third-party contract in 2019 and the completion of one significant contract with ISMMS in early 2020. This decrease was partially offset by growth in collaboration service activities due to the execution of two new third-party contracts in 2020.

The increase was primarily attributable to the following cost components: a $66.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses due to an increase in the fair value of the liability-classified awards and an increase in the number of outstanding awards due to increase in the number of stock-based compensation awards granted; a $1.4 million increase in occupancy expenses due to the execution of additional third party leases; and a $1.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to an increase in general and administrative headcount, partially offset by COVID-19 austerity measures.\nRelated Party Expenses\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related party expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(57) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRelated party expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.6%, to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.7 million decrease in service fees associated with a reduction of leased ISMMS employees, a $1.0 million decrease in fees associated with information technology support pursuant to the TSA with ISMMS and decreases in other various services provided by ISMMS pursuant to the TSA and service agreements. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in rent and facility expenses driven by additional office and lab space leased from\nISMMS pursuant to the transition services agreement and a $0.5 million increase in consultant costs driven by an increase in research and development efforts performed by ISMMS under consulting agreements.\nInterest Income\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>506 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(482) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income decreased by $0.5 million, or 49%, to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations, as a component in determining employee bonus compensation, and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We may in the future incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures. Other limitations include that Non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect:\n\u2022all expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u2022changes in our working capital needs;\n\u2022provision for income taxes, which may be a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate;\n\u2022the costs of replacing the assets being depreciated, which will often have to be replaced in the future;\n\u2022the non-cash component of employee compensation expense; and\n\u2022the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as revenue less cost of services, excluding stock-based compensation expense, labor costs due to our move, and COVID-19 costs. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as our Adjusted Gross Profit divided by our revenue. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nThe following is a reconciliation of revenue to our Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020\n(Restated) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019\n(Restated) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>179,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>196,174 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services </td> <td>228,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,389 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross (Loss) Profit\n</td> <td>(16,602) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,785 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,942 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>710 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Labor costs due to laboratory move (1)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 costs (2)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Gross Profit\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Gross Margin\n</td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n(1)Represents labor costs in respect of laboratory employees' time spent to support our laboratory move from New York City to Stamford, Connecticut in 2020. During the move, our laboratory employees dedicated their time to re-validating and re-establishing instruments and equipment, rebuilding interface, obtaining a CLIA license, and other tasks to make sure the move was done correctly. For GAAP purposes we included these activities in Cost of Services. However, as the laboratory move and effort spent by our employees are one-time activities, we adjusted our Gross Profit to reflect management's view of our normal operations.\n(2)Represents labor costs in respect laboratory employees' downtime. During the second quarter of 2020, we did not reduce the workforce in our laboratory due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we suffered significantly due to the decrease in volume in Women's Health and other products. Accordingly, we have adjusted our Gross Profit to reflect the management-assessed impact from the decrease in productivity of existing laboratory employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss adjusted for interest expense (income), net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses, transaction costs, other (income) expense, net, COVID-19 costs and change in fair market value of warrant and earn-out contingent liabilities and.

Management determined that the cash proceeds received from the business combination provides us with sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for at least twelve months from the date of this Annual Report.\nFurthermore, on November 15, 2021, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or the SVB Agreement, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, whereby SVB agreed to provide a $125 million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of November 15, 2024. No amounts were drawn as of December 31, 2021. Advances under the SVB\nAgreement will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) 4.00% and (2) the prime rate plus an applicable margin\nAccordingly, the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Nevertheless, we may also seek additional funding in the future through the sale of common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, the entry into other credit facilities or another form of third-party funding or by seeking other debt financing. In particular, if the Acquisition is consummated, we expect to issue 50 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $200 million pursuant to the Acquisition PIPE Investment.\nMaterial Cash Requirements for Known Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following is a description of commitments for known and reasonably likely cash requirements as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflected an increase in accounts receivable of $4.6 million driven by increase in testing volumes and billings, an $8.0 million increase in inventories driven by anticipated future growth due to a year-over-year increase in testing volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, a $4.4 million increase in other assets due to security deposits on certain office and laboratory locations, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $12.8 million due to increased operating expenditures in line with the growth of the business and a $4.5 million increase in other current liabilities driven by higher personnel-related accruals due to increased headcount at 2019 year-end as compared to 2018 year-end.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $20.8 million, which was attributable to $9.4 million in purchases of property and equipment and $11.4 million of costs related to development of internal-use software assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.0 million, which was attributable to $24.1 million in purchases of property and equipment and $7.9 million of costs related to development of internal-use software assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $15.4 million, which was attributable to $11.9 million in purchases of property and equipment and $3.5 million of costs related to development of internal-use software assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $493.7 million, which was attributable to the consummation of our business combination including: $350.0 million from the Prior PIPE Investment proceeds; $442.7 million from an equity infusion from the business combination, net of redemptions; offset by $230.7 million in the cash payments to certain Legacy Sema4 stockholders; payment of transaction costs of $51.8 million; and $3.8 million of stock appreciate rights pay-outs. These amounts were further offset by an $8.7 million repayment of long-term debt and $3.7 million of capital lease principal payments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $129.0 million, which was primarily attributable to $117.3 million in net cash proceeds from the issuance of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock and $15.9 million in net cash proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. These increases were partially offset by $4.0 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations and $0.2 million in principal payments on our long-term debt obligations.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $148.0 million, which was attributable to $118.8 million in net cash proceeds from the issuance of our Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock and $30.9 million in capital contributions from ISMMS, partially offset by $1.7 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenue and expense recorded during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our accounting policies. We have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially generate materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. Although actual results may differ from those estimates, we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when, or as, performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised products or services are transferred to a customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer. Our contracts require significant judgments in determining the transaction price and satisfying performance obligations.\nDiagnostic test revenue\nWe estimate a transaction price in arrangements with third-party insurance payors based on historical collection experience, contractual provisions and insurance reimbursement policies, payor mix, and other relevant information for applicable payor portfolios. The portfolio approach is used as a practical expedient to account for categories of diagnostic test contracts as collective groups rather than on an individual contract basis. Management believes that revenue recognized by utilizing the portfolio approach approximates the revenue that would have been recognized if an individual contract approach was used. For orders received for self-pay patients, we determine a transaction price associated with services rendered in consideration of implicit price concessions that are granted to such orders. The estimates for implicit price concessions require significant judgment and are based upon management's assessment of expected net collections, business and economic conditions, historical trends, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. For institutional clients, the customer is the institution. We determine a transaction price associated with services rendered in accordance with the contractual rates established with each customer.\nWe monitor these estimates at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required. Both the initial estimate and any subsequent revision to the estimate contain uncertainty and require the use of judgment in the estimation of the transaction price and application of the constraint for variable consideration. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which could affect revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. A 1% decrease or increase in our collection rate from third-party insurance payors, which we believe could be a reasonably likely change, would result in an unfavorable or favorable adjustment to diagnostic test revenue of approximately $16.2 million.\nOther revenue\nWe also recognize revenue from service agreements and collaboration agreements with Biopharma companies and other third parties pursuant to which we provide diagnostic testing and related data aggregation reporting services. Certain of these contracts provide non-refundable upfront payments, which we record as contract liabilities, and variable payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones during the contract term. Milestone payments are a form of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price only when it is probable that doing so will not result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the milestone is subsequently resolved.\nFor certain service or collaboration contracts that require us to transfer control of the service over time, we recognize revenue over time using an input measure based on costs incurred on the basis that this measure best reflects the pattern of transfer of control of the services to the customer. The measure of progress is developed using our best estimate of the performance period and the anticipated costs to be incurred to perform such services, including any subcontracted service costs.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs related to the development of our software applications for internal use. Capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. If a project constitutes an enhancement to existing software, we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. We exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. We periodically assess whether triggering events are present which would indicate that the internal-use software is impaired. To the extent that we change our estimates related to internal-use software, the amount of internal-use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nEarn-out Contingent Liability\nWe estimate the fair value of the total earn-out shares based on a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. The fair value of the earn-out contingent liability is sensitive to expected volatility estimated based on selected guideline public companies and the Company's common stock price which is sensitive to changes in the forecasts of earnings and/or the relevant operating metrics. The model used requires the use of assumptions regarding variables that are complex, subjective and generally require judgment to determine.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation for all employee and non-employee stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units are calculated based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant, while the fair value of stock options are calculated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of assumptions regarding a number of variables that are complex, subjective and generally require significant judgment to determine. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. Key assumptions include expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected term of stock option grants. When selecting these comparable companies, we considered the enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and whether there was sufficient historical share price information to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The expected term of the Company's options has been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method as the awards granted are qualified as plain-vanilla\u201d options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the expected holding periods corresponding with the expected term of the option. We estimate zero dividend yield as we have not historically paid dividends on common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes,\u201d under which deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We reduce deferred tax assets, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of our deferred tax assets. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We also intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) September 1, 2025, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation on recent accounting pronouncements can be found in Sema4's audited consolidated financial statements in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.", "summary": "This report provides a detailed discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for a health intelligence company. The company operates in the field of personalized medicine using artificial intelligence and machine learning to transform the practice of medicine.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should carefully read the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a patient-centered, health intelligence company with a mission to use artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning to enable personalized medicine for all. By leveraging leading data scientists and technology, our platform powers remarkable and unique insights that transform the practice of medicine including how disease is diagnosed, treated, and prevented.\nWe were established out of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai or ISMMS, and commenced operations in June 2017 as a commercial entity that could effectively engage diverse patient populations and health care institutions at scale. We have since established and deployed our comprehensive and integrated genomic and clinical\ndata platform and established a mature diagnostic testing business. We now maintain a database that includes more than 12 million de-identified individual clinical records, many with genomic profiles. We also manage a data asset over 47 petabytes in size, that has been expanding at more than 1 petabyte per month with an accelerating growth rate.\nCurrently, we derive the majority of our revenue from our diagnostic test solutions. Our diagnostic business generates revenue and engages with healthcare professionals working with patients primarily through our Women's Health and Oncology solutions.\nOur Women's Health solutions sequence and analyze an industry-leading number of genes and use interpretive information tools to translate raw sequencing and clinical data efficiently and accurately into digestible clinical reports that guide decision-making by patients and physicians. Our Oncology diagnostic solutions feature both somatic tumor profiling and hereditary cancer screenings, along with a foundational whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing approach. Our Sema4 Signal Hereditary Cancer solution determines if a patient carries an inherited genetic change that increases the risk of cancer or informs on cancer treatment. We believe our Signal Whole Exome and Transcriptome solution is one of the most comprehensive molecular profiling solutions from a commercial entity to receive New York State approval. Beginning in May of 2020, we also expanded our diagnostic testing services to include testing for the presence of COVID-19, which we intend to discontinue by March 31, 2022.\nWe have also expanded beyond diagnostic testing to enter into service agreements with third parties to provide diagnostic testing, research, and related data aggregation reporting services. We have established and continue to seek strategic relationships with pharmaceutical and biotech, or Biopharma, companies to enable innovation across the entire drug lifecycle, from next-generation drug discovery and development, to post-market efficacy surveillance, to informing on bioavailability, toxicity, tolerability, and other features critical to drug development.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe several important factors have impacted, and will continue to impact, our performance and results of operations. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must address. See the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for more information.\nNumber of resulted tests\nWe historically reported both accessioned and resulted tests as important factors impacting our performance. A test is resulted once the appropriate workflow is completed and details are provided to the ordered patients or healthcare professional for reviews, which corresponds to the timing of our revenue recognition. We believe the number of resulted tests in any period is more important and useful to our investors because it directly correlates with long-term patient relationships and the size of our genomic database. Therefore, we do not plan to report the number of accessioned tests.\nSuccess obtaining and maintaining reimbursement\nOur ability to increase the number of billable tests and our revenue therefrom will depend on our success in achieving reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors. Reimbursement by a payor may depend on several factors, including a payor's determination that a test is appropriate, medically necessary, cost-effective, and has received prior authorization. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to provide coverage for our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse us for a test, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process.\nIn cases where we or our partners have established reimbursement rates with third-party payors, we face additional challenges in complying with their procedural requirements for reimbursement. These requirements often vary from payor to payor and are reassessed by third-party payors regularly. As a result, in the past we have needed additional time and resources to comply with the requirements.\nWe expect to continue to focus our resources on increasing the adoption of, and expanding coverage and reimbursement for, our current and any future tests we may develop or acquire. If we fail to expand and maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue and our future business prospects may be adversely affected.\nAbility to lower the costs associated with performing our tests\nReducing the costs associated with performing our diagnostic tests is both our focus and a strategic objective. We source, and will continue to source, components of our diagnostic testing workflows from third parties. We also rely upon third-party service providers for data storage and workflow management.\nIncreasing adoption of our services by existing and new customers\nOur performance depends on our ability to retain and broaden the adoption of our services with existing customers as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our success in retaining and gaining new customers is dependent on the market's confidence in our services and the willingness of customers to continue to seek more comprehensive and integrated genomic and clinical data insights.\nInvestment in platform innovation to support commercial growth\nWe are seeking to leverage and deploy our Centrellis and Traversa platforms to develop a pipeline of future disease-specific research and diagnostic and therapeutic products and services. We have limited experience in the development or commercialization of clinical or research products in connection with our database and our Centrellis platform.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Our business faces changing technologies, shifting provider and patient needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant, and useful products, services, and technologies on time. As our business evolves, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including investments through acquisitions and partnerships. These investments are critical to the enhancement of our current diagnostics and health information and data science technologies from which existing and new service offerings are derived.\nWe expect to incur significant expenses to advance these development efforts, but they may not be successful. New potential services may fail at any stage of development and, if we determine that any of our current or future services are unlikely to succeed, we may abandon them without any return on our investment. If we are unsuccessful in developing additional services, our growth potential may be impaired.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use the following key financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. These key financial and operating metrics should be read in conjunction with the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report.\nThe principal focus of our commercial operations is to offer our diagnostic tests through both our direct sales force and laboratory distribution partners. Test volume correlates with genomic database size and long-term patient relationships. Thus, test volumes drive database diversity and enable potential identification of variants of unknown significance and population-specific insights. The number of tests resulted is a key indicator that we use to assess the operational efficiency of our business. Once the appropriate workflow is completed, the test is resulted and details are provided to ordered patients or healthcare professionals for reviews.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we resulted 709,942 tests in our laboratories, 418,053 tests of which were for COVID-19, compared to the period ended December 31, 2020, in which we resulted approximately 540,407 tests in our laboratories, 332,764 of which were for COVID-19. This 31% increase in resulted volume from 2020 to 2021 largely resulted from newly entered service agreements for COVID-19 testing as well as an increase in non-COVID-19 institutional testing. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we resulted approximately 155,497 tests in our laboratories, none of which were for COVID-19. The 248% increase in resulted volume from 2019 to 2020 largely resulted from newly entered service agreements for COVID-19 testing, offset by a slowdown in the base diagnostic business during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic given that many of our customers, including hospitals and clinics, had suspended non-emergency appointments and services.\nAs discussed above, we no longer report the number of accessioned tests as a key performance indicator because the number of resulted tests more directly correlates with long-term patient relationships and the size of our genomic database.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, an extensive impact on the global health and economic environments since the initial outbreak in March 2020.\nBeginning in April 2020, our diagnostic test volumes decreased significantly as compared to the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related limitations and priorities across the healthcare system. In response, beginning in May 2020, we entered into several service agreements with state governments and healthcare institutions to provide testing for the presence of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 test volumes grew significantly from the introduction of the service offering through the remainder of 2020 and further increased in 2021. To support the rapid expansion of COVID-19 test volumes, we increased our workforce through both temporary contractors and employees. In addition, while most of our revenues from genetic testing rely upon reimbursements from third party payors, healthcare institutions, and individuals, the majority of our COVID-19 test revenues rely upon reimbursements from state governments and healthcare institutions. In addition, COVID-19 testing yields lower revenues per tests and incurs lower costs to perform each test. We have also experienced a slowdown in receivable collections since the onset of the pandemic, but do not expect those collection trends to continue.\nAs part of our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented various strategies to mitigate operating risks, reduce costs and improve cash collections. We have made significant advance purchases of test-related inventory in order to reduce the risk of potential business interruptions related to supply chain disruption. We also contracted with third-party vendors to collect and test COVID-19 samples to reduce operating risks related to employee health. Temporary COVID-19 austerity measures included cancellation of the 2020 annual merit compensation increase, temporary salary reductions from May through July 2020 and deferral of the 401(k) employer match from May through December 2020. The employer match was reinstated in January 2021, and the deferred portion was funded on March 9, 2021. To support our sales employees with commission-based compensation structure, we implemented temporary minimum commissions during the second quarter of 2020. No such minimums were in place in any quarter after the second quarter nor are any such minimums expected to be implemented again in the near term. No employee layoffs were implemented as part of these austerity measures.\nAs conditions improve, we are focused on overhauling our revenue cycle, and as part of transformational activities hired a Chief Revenue Officer and established a revenue cycle Center of Excellence. As part of our efforts to improve our collection efficiency and overall financial health, we are also undergoing various process transformations within the Order-to-Cash and Procure-to-Pay cycles.\nWhile test volumes have since improved, we continue to experience changes in the mix of tests due to the impact of the COVID-19 and its variants. We anticipate that demand for COVID-19 tests will decrease as vaccines continue to be developed and deployed to the general population. For this reason, we announced in December 2021 that we had decided to discontinue COVID-19 testing services by March 31, 2022 and began notifying our COVID-19 testing solutions customers of this decision. We intend to dedicate all of our efforts and resources to our core mission to transform healthcare by using artificial intelligence to enable the delivery of precision medicine as the standard of care, and do not expect declines for our other revenue streams during 2022. The full extent to which\nthe COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 or its variants, the actions taken to contain it or treat it and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets and supply chains. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the foreseeable future.\nIn March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was signed into law which was a stimulus bill that, among other things, provided assistance to qualifying businesses and individuals and included funding for the healthcare system. We received $5.4 million in 2020 as part of the stimulus, comprised of $2.6 million received under the Provider Relief Fund, or PRF, distribution and $2.8 million received under the Employee Retention Credit, or ERC, distribution. During 2021, we received an additional $5.6 million under the PRF distribution.\nPRF distributions to healthcare providers are not loans and will not be required to be repaid; however, as a condition to receiving these payments, providers must agree to certain terms and conditions and submit sufficient documentation demonstrating that the funds are being used for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have concluded it is probable that all terms and conditions associated with the PRF distribution have been met. As a result, we recorded the PRF distributions in other income (expense), net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the periods in which we received the distributions.\nERC distributions are refundable tax credits for 50% of qualified wages paid to employees during the pandemic. A company is eligible for the ERC if it has not received a Paycheck Protection Program loan under the Cares Act and (1) its operations have been fully or partially suspended because of COVID-19 or (2) its gross receipts in a calendar quarter in 2020 declined by more than 50% from the same period in 2019. At the time of applying for the ERC, we concluded that it was reasonably possible the eligibility requirements would be met; however, due to a change in circumstances, we are re-evaluating our position. As such, we deferred the recognition of the ERC distribution and recorded the proceeds in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAt this time, we are not certain of the availability, extent or impact of any future relief provided under the CARES Act or other stimulus initiatives.\nRecent Developments\nIn January 2022, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Orion Merger Sub I, Inc., or Merger Sub I, and Orion Merger Sub II, LLC, or Merger Sub II, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, with GeneDx, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, or GeneDx, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc., or OPKO, GeneDx Holding 2, Inc., or Holdco, and OPKO to acquire 100% of GeneDx (which we refer to as the Acquisition\u201d). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, we will pay consideration to OPKO for the Acquisition of (i) $150 million in cash at the closing of the Acquisition, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement, (ii) 80 million shares of our Class A common stock to be issued at the closing of the Acquisition and (iii) up to $150 million payable following the closing of the Acquisition, if certain revenue-based milestones are achieved for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. These milestone payments, if and to the extent earned under the terms of the Merger Agreement, will be satisfied through the payment and/or issuance of a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock (valued at $4.86 per share), with such mix to be determined in our sole discretion.\nThe completion of the Acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions (which, as of the date of this report, have not been met), including certain regulatory and other third party approvals, the consummation of a pre-closing restructuring and certain approvals of our stockholders related to the Acquisition). The Acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2022. If this pending Acquisition is consummated, consistent with our business model, we expect to leverage the combined health information database of Sema4 and GeneDx to partner with additional health systems and biopharma companies to transform patient care and therapeutic development and enable precision medicine for all.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into subscription agreements with certain institutional investors, pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, these investors have collectively subscribed for 50 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $200 million (which we refer to as the Acquisition PIPE Investment\u201d). The Acquisition PIPE Investment will be consummated substantially concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from diagnostic testing services, which primarily relate to Women's Health, Oncology and COVID-19. We also recognize revenue from collaboration service agreements with Biopharma companies and other third parties pursuant to which we provide diagnostic testing and related data aggregation reporting services. As discussed above, in December 2021, we announced that we decided to discontinue COVID-19 testing services by March 31, 2022 and begun notifying its COVID-19 testing solutions customers of this decision.\nWe recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nDiagnostic Test Revenue\nWe primarily generate revenue from performing diagnostic testing services for three groups of customers: healthcare professionals working with patients with third-party insurance coverage or without third-party insurance coverage or those who elect to self-pay; and institutional clients, such as hospitals, clinics, state governments and reference laboratories. Customers are billed upon delivery of test results. The amount of revenue recognized for diagnostic testing services depends on a number of factors, such as contracted rates with our customers and third-party insurance providers, insurance reimbursement policies, payor mix, historical collection experience, price concessions and other business and economic conditions and trends. To date, the majority of our diagnostic test revenue has been earned from orders received for patients with third-party insurance coverage.\nOur ability to increase our diagnostic test revenue will depend on our ability to increase our market penetration, obtain contracted reimbursement coverage from third-party payers, enter into contracts with institutions, and increase our reimbursement rate for tests performed.\nOther Revenue\nWe generate revenue from providing diagnostic testing and related data aggregation reporting services under both short-term and long-term project-based collaboration service agreements with third parties. The terms of these contracts generally include non-refundable upfront payments, which we record as contract liabilities, and variable payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones during the contract term.\nWith respect to existing collaboration service agreements, our revenue may fluctuate period to period due to the pattern in which we may deliver our services, our ability to achieve milestones, the timing of costs incurred, changes in estimates of total anticipated costs that we expect to incur during the contract period, and other events that may not be within our control. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to enter into contracts with third-party partners.\nCost of Services\nThe cost of services reflect the aggregate costs incurred in performing services. These costs include expenses for reagents and laboratory supplies, personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries and benefits) and stock-based compensation for employees directly involved in revenue generating activities, shipping and handling fees, costs of third-party reference lab testing and phlebotomy services and allocated genetic counseling, facility and IT costs associated with delivery services. Allocated costs include depreciation of laboratory equipment, facility occupancy, and information technology costs. The cost of services are recorded as the services are performed.\nWe expect the cost of services to generally increase in line with the anticipated growth in diagnostic testing volume and services we provide under our collaboration service agreements. However, we expect the cost per test to decrease over the long term due to the efficiencies we may gain from improved utilization of our laboratory capacity, automation, and other value engineering initiatives. These expected reductions may be offset by new tests which often have a higher cost per test during the introductory phases before we can gain efficiencies. The cost per test may fluctuate from period to period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and future test offerings. These costs are principally associated with our efforts to develop the software we use to analyze data and process customer orders. These costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries and benefits), stock-based compensation for employees performing research and development, innovation and product development activities, costs of reagents and laboratory supplies, costs of consultants and third-party services, equipment and related depreciation expenses, non-capitalizable software development costs, research funding to our research partners as part of research and development agreements and allocated facility and information technology costs associated with genomics medical research. Research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred and certain non-refundable advanced payments provided to our research partners are expensed as the related activities are performed.\nWe generally expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as we innovate and expand the application of our platforms. However, we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of our development and commercialization efforts and fluctuations in our compensation-related charges.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries, and benefits) and stock-based compensation for employees performing commercial sales, account management, marketing, and allocation of genetic counseling services related to medical education. Selling and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe generally expect our selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our commercial sales and marketing and counseling teams and increase marketing activities. However, we expect selling and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, subject to fluctuations from period to period due to the timing and magnitude of these expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries and benefits) and stock-based compensation for employees in executive leadership, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, strategy and other administrative functions. In addition, these expenses include office occupancy and information technology costs. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe generally expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase headcount and incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to legal, accounting, and regulatory matters; maintaining compliance with requirements of the Nasdaq and of the SEC; director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations. We expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as revenue increases, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to fluctuations in our compensation-related charges.\nRelated Party Expenses\nRelated party expenses primarily consist of amounts incurred in connection with transactions occurred with ISMMS for expenses under our transition services agreement, or TSA, with ISMMS which expired at the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2021, and other service agreements. Additional information can be found in our consolidated financial statements in Note 7, Related Party Transactions\u201d included within this Annual Report.\nWe generally expect related party expenses to decrease as we establish our own internal and external resources to fulfill the administrative and other services we have historically procured from ISMMS.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of interest earned on money market funds.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs related to our capital leases and our long-term debt arrangements, including unused line fee and the amortization of deferred transaction costs related to the loan and security agreement entered into with Silicon Valley Bank to provide a $125 million revolving credit facility described elsewhere in this report.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net primarily consists of funding received under the CARES Act. We recognized $2.6 million of the $5.4 million of funding received under the CARES Act as other income, net on the statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2020. We recognized $5.6 million of additional funding received under the CARES Act during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the amount is included in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the loss incurred due to early payment penalties recognized upon extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million is included in other income, net.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of consolidated operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented below.\nCertain expenses were previously misclassified as cost of services and they are now reported as selling and marketing. The adjustment is reflected in the amounts reported below for years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\n\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue increased by $32.9 million, or 18%, to $212.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $179.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDiagnostic test revenue increased by $29.7 million, or 17%, to $205.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $175.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to a 135% increase in oncology test volumes,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should carefully read the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a patient-centered, health intelligence company with a mission to use artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning to enable personalized medicine for all. By leveraging leading data scientists and technology, our platform powers remarkable and unique insights that transform the practice of medicine including how disease is diagnosed, treated, and prevented.\nWe were established out of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai or ISMMS, and commenced operations in June 2017 as a commercial entity that could effectively engage diverse patient populations and health care institutions at scale. We have since established and deployed our comprehensive and integrated genomic and clinical\ndata platform and established a mature diagnostic testing business. We now maintain a database that includes more than 12 million de-identified individual clinical records, many with genomic profiles. We also manage a data asset over 47 petabytes in size, that has been expanding at more than 1 petabyte per month with an accelerating growth rate.\nCurrently, we derive the majority of our revenue from our diagnostic test solutions. Our diagnostic business generates revenue and engages with healthcare professionals working with patients primarily through our Women's Health and Oncology solutions.\nOur Women's Health solutions sequence and analyze an industry-leading number of genes and use interpretive information tools to translate raw sequencing and clinical data efficiently and accurately into digestible clinical reports that guide decision-making by patients and physicians. Our Oncology diagnostic solutions feature both somatic tumor profiling and hereditary cancer screenings, along with a foundational whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing approach. Our Sema4 Signal Hereditary Cancer solution determines if a patient carries an inherited genetic change that increases the risk of cancer or informs on cancer treatment. We believe our Signal Whole Exome and Transcriptome solution is one of the most comprehensive molecular profiling solutions from a commercial entity to receive New York State approval. Beginning in May of 2020, we also expanded our diagnostic testing services to include testing for the presence of COVID-19, which we intend to discontinue by March 31, 2022.\nWe have also expanded beyond diagnostic testing to enter into service agreements with third parties to provide diagnostic testing, research, and related data aggregation reporting services. We have established and continue to seek strategic relationships with pharmaceutical and biotech, or Biopharma, companies to enable innovation across the entire drug lifecycle, from next-generation drug discovery and development, to post-market efficacy surveillance, to informing on bioavailability, toxicity, tolerability, and other features critical to drug development.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe several important factors have impacted, and will continue to impact, our performance and results of operations. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must address. See the section titled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for more information.\nNumber of resulted tests\nWe historically reported both accessioned and resulted tests as important factors impacting our performance. A test is resulted once the appropriate workflow is completed and details are provided to the ordered patients or healthcare professional for reviews, which corresponds to the timing of our revenue recognition. We believe the number of resulted tests in any period is more important and useful to our investors because it directly correlates with long-term patient relationships and the size of our genomic database. Therefore, we do not plan to report the number of accessioned tests.\nSuccess obtaining and maintaining reimbursement\nOur ability to increase the number of billable tests and our revenue therefrom will depend on our success in achieving reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors. Reimbursement by a payor may depend on several factors, including a payor's determination that a test is appropriate, medically necessary, cost-effective, and has received prior authorization. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to provide coverage for our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse us for a test, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process.\nIn cases where we or our partners have established reimbursement rates with third-party payors, we face additional challenges in complying with their procedural requirements for reimbursement. These requirements often vary from payor to payor and are reassessed by third-party payors regularly. As a result, in the past we have needed additional time and resources to comply with the requirements.\nWe expect to continue to focus our resources on increasing the adoption of, and expanding coverage and reimbursement for, our current and any future tests we may develop or acquire. If we fail to expand and maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue and our future business prospects may be adversely affected.\nAbility to lower the costs associated with performing our tests\nReducing the costs associated with performing our diagnostic tests is both our focus and a strategic objective. We source, and will continue to source, components of our diagnostic testing workflows from third parties. We also rely upon third-party service providers for data storage and workflow management.\nIncreasing adoption of our services by existing and new customers\nOur performance depends on our ability to retain and broaden the adoption of our services with existing customers as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our success in retaining and gaining new customers is dependent on the market's confidence in our services and the willingness of customers to continue to seek more comprehensive and integrated genomic and clinical data insights.\nInvestment in platform innovation to support commercial growth\nWe are seeking to leverage and deploy our Centrellis and Traversa platforms to develop a pipeline of future disease-specific research and diagnostic and therapeutic products and services. We have limited experience in the development or commercialization of clinical or research products in connection with our database and our Centrellis platform.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Our business faces changing technologies, shifting provider and patient needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant, and useful products, services, and technologies on time. As our business evolves, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including investments through acquisitions and partnerships. These investments are critical to the enhancement of our current diagnostics and health information and data science technologies from which existing and new service offerings are derived.\nWe expect to incur significant expenses to advance these development efforts, but they may not be successful. New potential services may fail at any stage of development and, if we determine that any of our current or future services are unlikely to succeed, we may abandon them without any return on our investment. If we are unsuccessful in developing additional services, our growth potential may be impaired.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe use the following key financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. These key financial and operating metrics should be read in conjunction with the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report.\nThe principal focus of our commercial operations is to offer our diagnostic tests through both our direct sales force and laboratory distribution partners. Test volume correlates with genomic database size and long-term patient relationships. Thus, test volumes drive database diversity and enable potential identification of variants of unknown significance and population-specific insights. The number of tests resulted is a key indicator that we use to assess the operational efficiency of our business. Once the appropriate workflow is completed, the test is resulted and details are provided to ordered patients or healthcare professionals for reviews.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we resulted 709,942 tests in our laboratories, 418,053 tests of which were for COVID-19, compared to the period ended December 31, 2020, in which we resulted approximately 540,407 tests in our laboratories, 332,764 of which were for COVID-19. This 31% increase in resulted volume from 2020 to 2021 largely resulted from newly entered service agreements for COVID-19 testing as well as an increase in non-COVID-19 institutional testing. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we resulted approximately 155,497 tests in our laboratories, none of which were for COVID-19. The 248% increase in resulted volume from 2019 to 2020 largely resulted from newly entered service agreements for COVID-19 testing, offset by a slowdown in the base diagnostic business during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic given that many of our customers, including hospitals and clinics, had suspended non-emergency appointments and services.\nAs discussed above, we no longer report the number of accessioned tests as a key performance indicator because the number of resulted tests more directly correlates with long-term patient relationships and the size of our genomic database.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, an extensive impact on the global health and economic environments since the initial outbreak in March 2020.\nBeginning in April 2020, our diagnostic test volumes decreased significantly as compared to the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related limitations and priorities across the healthcare system. In response, beginning in May 2020, we entered into several service agreements with state governments and healthcare institutions to provide testing for the presence of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 test volumes grew significantly from the introduction of the service offering through the remainder of 2020 and further increased in 2021. To support the rapid expansion of COVID-19 test volumes, we increased our workforce through both temporary contractors and employees. In addition, while most of our revenues from genetic testing rely upon reimbursements from third party payors, healthcare institutions, and individuals, the majority of our COVID-19 test revenues rely upon reimbursements from state governments and healthcare institutions. In addition, COVID-19 testing yields lower revenues per tests and incurs lower costs to perform each test. We have also experienced a slowdown in receivable collections since the onset of the pandemic, but do not expect those collection trends to continue.\nAs part of our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented various strategies to mitigate operating risks, reduce costs and improve cash collections. We have made significant advance purchases of test-related inventory in order to reduce the risk of potential business interruptions related to supply chain disruption. We also contracted with third-party vendors to collect and test COVID-19 samples to reduce operating risks related to employee health. Temporary COVID-19 austerity measures included cancellation of the 2020 annual merit compensation increase, temporary salary reductions from May through July 2020 and deferral of the 401(k) employer match from May through December 2020. The employer match was reinstated in January 2021, and the deferred portion was funded on March 9, 2021. To support our sales employees with commission-based compensation structure, we implemented temporary minimum commissions during the second quarter of 2020. No such minimums were in place in any quarter after the second quarter nor are any such minimums expected to be implemented again in the near term. No employee layoffs were implemented as part of these austerity measures.\nAs conditions improve, we are focused on overhauling our revenue cycle, and as part of transformational activities hired a Chief Revenue Officer and established a revenue cycle Center of Excellence. As part of our efforts to improve our collection efficiency and overall financial health, we are also undergoing various process transformations within the Order-to-Cash and Procure-to-Pay cycles.\nWhile test volumes have since improved, we continue to experience changes in the mix of tests due to the impact of the COVID-19 and its variants. We anticipate that demand for COVID-19 tests will decrease as vaccines continue to be developed and deployed to the general population. For this reason, we announced in December 2021 that we had decided to discontinue COVID-19 testing services by March 31, 2022 and began notifying our COVID-19 testing solutions customers of this decision. We intend to dedicate all of our efforts and resources to our core mission to transform healthcare by using artificial intelligence to enable the delivery of precision medicine as the standard of care, and do not expect declines for our other revenue streams during 2022. The full extent to which\nthe COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 or its variants, the actions taken to contain it or treat it and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets and supply chains. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the foreseeable future.\nIn March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was signed into law which was a stimulus bill that, among other things, provided assistance to qualifying businesses and individuals and included funding for the healthcare system. We received $5.4 million in 2020 as part of the stimulus, comprised of $2.6 million received under the Provider Relief Fund, or PRF, distribution and $2.8 million received under the Employee Retention Credit, or ERC, distribution. During 2021, we received an additional $5.6 million under the PRF distribution.\nPRF distributions to healthcare providers are not loans and will not be required to be repaid; however, as a condition to receiving these payments, providers must agree to certain terms and conditions and submit sufficient documentation demonstrating that the funds are being used for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have concluded it is probable that all terms and conditions associated with the PRF distribution have been met. As a result, we recorded the PRF distributions in other income (expense), net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the periods in which we received the distributions.\nERC distributions are refundable tax credits for 50% of qualified wages paid to employees during the pandemic. A company is eligible for the ERC if it has not received a Paycheck Protection Program loan under the Cares Act and (1) its operations have been fully or partially suspended because of COVID-19 or (2) its gross receipts in a calendar quarter in 2020 declined by more than 50% from the same period in 2019. At the time of applying for the ERC, we concluded that it was reasonably possible the eligibility requirements would be met; however, due to a change in circumstances, we are re-evaluating our position. As such, we deferred the recognition of the ERC distribution and recorded the proceeds in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAt this time, we are not certain of the availability, extent or impact of any future relief provided under the CARES Act or other stimulus initiatives.\nRecent Developments\nIn January 2022, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Orion Merger Sub I, Inc., or Merger Sub I, and Orion Merger Sub II, LLC, or Merger Sub II, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, with GeneDx, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, or GeneDx, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc., or OPKO, GeneDx Holding 2, Inc., or Holdco, and OPKO to acquire 100% of GeneDx (which we refer to as the Acquisition\u201d). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, we will pay consideration to OPKO for the Acquisition of (i) $150 million in cash at the closing of the Acquisition, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement, (ii) 80 million shares of our Class A common stock to be issued at the closing of the Acquisition and (iii) up to $150 million payable following the closing of the Acquisition, if certain revenue-based milestones are achieved for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. These milestone payments, if and to the extent earned under the terms of the Merger Agreement, will be satisfied through the payment and/or issuance of a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock (valued at $4.86 per share), with such mix to be determined in our sole discretion.\nThe completion of the Acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions (which, as of the date of this report, have not been met), including certain regulatory and other third party approvals, the consummation of a pre-closing restructuring and certain approvals of our stockholders related to the Acquisition). The Acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2022. If this pending Acquisition is consummated, consistent with our business model, we expect to leverage the combined health information database of Sema4 and GeneDx to partner with additional health systems and biopharma companies to transform patient care and therapeutic development and enable precision medicine for all.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into subscription agreements with certain institutional investors, pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, these investors have collectively subscribed for 50 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $200 million (which we refer to as the Acquisition PIPE Investment\u201d). The Acquisition PIPE Investment will be consummated substantially concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from diagnostic testing services, which primarily relate to Women's Health, Oncology and COVID-19.

The terms of these contracts generally include non-refundable upfront payments, which we record as contract liabilities, and variable payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones during the contract term.\nWith respect to existing collaboration service agreements, our revenue may fluctuate period to period due to the pattern in which we may deliver our services, our ability to achieve milestones, the timing of costs incurred, changes in estimates of total anticipated costs that we expect to incur during the contract period, and other events that may not be within our control. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to enter into contracts with third-party partners.\nCost of Services\nThe cost of services reflect the aggregate costs incurred in performing services. These costs include expenses for reagents and laboratory supplies, personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries and benefits) and stock-based compensation for employees directly involved in revenue generating activities, shipping and handling fees, costs of third-party reference lab testing and phlebotomy services and allocated genetic counseling, facility and IT costs associated with delivery services. Allocated costs include depreciation of laboratory equipment, facility occupancy, and information technology costs. The cost of services are recorded as the services are performed.\nWe expect the cost of services to generally increase in line with the anticipated growth in diagnostic testing volume and services we provide under our collaboration service agreements.

These costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries and benefits), stock-based compensation for employees performing research and development, innovation and product development activities, costs of reagents and laboratory supplies, costs of consultants and third-party services, equipment and related depreciation expenses, non-capitalizable software development costs, research funding to our research partners as part of research and development agreements and allocated facility and information technology costs associated with genomics medical research. Research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred and certain non-refundable advanced payments provided to our research partners are expensed as the related activities are performed.\nWe generally expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as we innovate and expand the application of our platforms. However, we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of our development and commercialization efforts and fluctuations in our compensation-related charges.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries, and benefits) and stock-based compensation for employees performing commercial sales, account management, marketing, and allocation of genetic counseling services related to medical education. Selling and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe generally expect our selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our commercial sales and marketing and counseling teams and increase marketing activities. However, we expect selling and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, subject to fluctuations from period to period due to the timing and magnitude of these expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses (comprising salaries and benefits) and stock-based compensation for employees in executive leadership, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, strategy and other administrative functions. In addition, these expenses include office occupancy and information technology costs. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe generally expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase headcount and incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to legal, accounting, and regulatory matters; maintaining compliance with requirements of the Nasdaq and of the SEC; director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations. We expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as revenue increases, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to fluctuations in our compensation-related charges.\nRelated Party Expenses\nRelated party expenses primarily consist of amounts incurred in connection with transactions occurred with ISMMS for expenses under our transition services agreement, or TSA, with ISMMS which expired at the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2021, and other service agreements. Additional information can be found in our consolidated financial statements in Note 7, Related Party Transactions\u201d included within this Annual Report.\nWe generally expect related party expenses to decrease as we establish our own internal and external resources to fulfill the administrative and other services we have historically procured from ISMMS.\nInterest Income\nInterest income primarily consists of interest earned on money market funds.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs related to our capital leases and our long-term debt arrangements, including unused line fee and the amortization of deferred transaction costs related to the loan and security agreement entered into with Silicon Valley Bank to provide a $125 million revolving credit facility described elsewhere in this report.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net primarily consists of funding received under the CARES Act. We recognized $2.6 million of the $5.4 million of funding received under the CARES Act as other income, net on the statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2020. We recognized $5.6 million of additional funding received under the CARES Act during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the amount is included in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the loss incurred due to early payment penalties recognized upon extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million is included in other income, net.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of consolidated operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented below.\nCertain expenses were previously misclassified as cost of services and they are now reported as selling and marketing.
