Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand United Financial Bancorp, Inc., our operations and our present business environment. We believe accuracy, transparency and clarity are the primary goals of successful financial reporting. We remain committed to transparency in our financial reporting, providing our stockholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting an accurate view of our financial disclosures, financial position and operating results.\nMD&A is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes thereto contained in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The following sections are included in MD&A:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our Business - a general description of our business, our objectives and the challenges and risks of our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Critical Accounting Estimates - a discussion of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating Results - an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - an overview of financial condition and market and interest rate risk.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Business\nGeneral\nBy assets, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. is the third largest publicly traded banking institution headquartered in Connecticut with consolidated assets of $7.11 billion and stockholders' equity of $693.3 million at December 31, 2017. United's business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision-making authority. The Company delivers financial services to individuals, families, businesses and municipalities throughout Connecticut and Western and Central Massachusetts and the region through its 53 banking offices, its commercial loan and mortgage loan production offices, 64 ATMs, telephone banking, mobile banking and online banking (www.bankatunited.com).\nThe Company strives to remain a leader in meeting the financial service needs of the community and to provide superior customer service to the businesses and individuals in the market areas that it has served since 1858. United Bank is a community-oriented provider of traditional banking products and services to business organizations and individuals, offering products such as commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, residential real estate and consumer loans and a variety of deposit products. Our business philosophy is to remain a community-oriented franchise and continue to focus on providing superior customer service to meet the financial needs of the communities in which we operate. Current strategies include: (1) allocating capital to lending activities that are accretive to the Company's return on assets and return on equity; continuing to acquire and support commercial clients through lending activities and cash management and deposit services which exhibit acceptable credit adjusted spreads; and growing our deposit base through acquisition of low cost deposits; (2) increasing the non-interest income component of total revenues through development of banking-related fee income and the sale of investment products ;(3) continuing to improve operating efficiencies and maintain expense discipline; and (4) developing products and services that expand our banking network through mobile and internet channels and making opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, loans, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses from time to time.\nThe Company's results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds, consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by the Company's provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income primarily consists of fee income from depositors, gain on sale of loans, mortgage servicing income and loan sale income and increases in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d). Non-interest expense consists principally of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, service bureau fees, marketing, professional fees, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses.\nResults of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions and changes in interest rates as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations or government policies may materially affect the Company.\nOur Objectives\nThe Company seeks to grow organically and through strategic mergers/acquisitions as well as to continually deliver superior value to its customers, stockholders, employees and communities through achievement of its core operating objectives which are to:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Align earning asset growth with organic capital and low cost core deposit generation to maintain strong capital and liquidity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Re-mix cash flows into better yielding risk adjusted return on assets with lower funding costs relative to peers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Invest in people, systems and technology to grow revenue and improve customer experience while maintaining attractive cost structure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Grow operating revenue, maximize operating earnings, grow tangible book value and pay dividends. Achieve more revenue into non-interest income and core fee income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Significant factors management reviews to evaluate achievement of the Company's operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include, but are not limited to: net income and earnings per share, return on tangible equity and assets, net interest margin, non-interest income, operating expenses related to total average assets and efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP metric), asset quality, loan and deposit growth, capital management, liquidity and interest rate sensitivity levels, customer service standards, market share and peer comparisons.\nChallenges and Risks\nAs we look forward, management has identified five key challenges and risks that are likely to present challenges for near term performance:\nNet interest income. The growth of net interest income is vital to our continued success and profitability. In 2017, our tax-equivalent net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.01%. This increase was mostly due to improvements in the yields of the commercial portfolio, driven by the variable/floating rate segments tied to Prime and LIBOR indices, as well as improvement in the yields of the home equity line of credit portfolio. In 2017, the Company continued to execute interest rate swaps, with a higher level of transactional volume as compared to the prior year. The loan swap fee income is generated as part of the Company's loan level hedge program that is offered to certain commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The LIBOR based adjustable rate loans created through the loan level hedge program effected net interest margin, but better position the Company for a rising interest rate environment. The Company's ability to decrease the cost of funding relative to 2017 is diminished due to the expectation of future short term increases and the Fed Funds rate by the Federal Open Market Committee and any improvement in the cost will be dependent on a more favorable deposit mix with more low cost demand deposit accounts.\nThe risk associated with our deposit pricing strategy is a potential outflow of deposits to competitors in search of higher rates. We will continue to focus on enhancing and developing new products in a cost effective manner and believe that will help mitigate the risk of deposit outflow. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the pricing opportunities in our lending area.\nMaintaining credit quality and rigorous risk management. The national economy continued to improve through 2017. The Company continued to maintain its strong credit quality as delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs generally outperform the average of our peer group. Our ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.59%, total delinquencies to total loans was 0.56% and our allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.88% at December 31, 2017. Net loan charge-offs remained relatively flat at $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect to be able to continue to maintain strong asset quality relative to industry levels. Risk management oversight of operations is a critical component of our enterprise risk management framework.\nCompetition in the marketplace. United faces competition within the financial services industry from some well-established national and local companies. We expect loan and deposit competition to remain vigorous. However, we are poised to take advantage of the continuing industry consolidation in our market and consumers' willingness to switch financial service providers because of their skepticism of big banks.\u201d Therefore, we must continue to recruit and retain the best talent, expand our product offerings, expand our market area, improve operating efficiencies and develop and maintain our brand to increase market share to benefit from these opportunities.\nRegulatory considerations. The banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Continued changes to the regulatory landscape is the norm. Recent changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations, including the continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III have and will continue to affect the lending, investment and operating activities of the Company. While these regulatory changes made were to ensure the long-term stability in the financial markets, Management will have to apply additional resources to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.\nIn July 2013, the three Federal bank regulatory agencies (the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) approved the final Basel III rules that amended the existing capital adequacy requirements of banks and bank holding companies for smaller banks as defined. The new rules became effective for smaller banks and bank holding companies on January 15, 2015, with full phase-in to be completed by January 1, 2019. The\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompany believes it will continue to exceed all expected well-capitalized regulatory requirements upon the complete phase-in of Basel III.\nIn complying with new regulations, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be impacted in a way we cannot currently predict or mitigate, but we will continue to monitor the regulatory rulings and will work to execute the most beneficial course of action for the Company's shareholders.\nManaging expansion, growth, and future acquisitions. On April 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Legacy United. The Company's primary growth will be organic but we may use acquisition to supplement organic growth. We anticipate this growth will expand our brand into new geographic markets as we implement our business model. Since December 2015, the Company has strategically purchased various types of loan portfolios to compliment organic loan growth. The outstanding principal balances of purchased loans serviced by others at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $470.4 million and $377.5 million, respectively. These loans extend beyond our geographic footprint with quality borrowers that we would not be able to originate in our market area.\nThe success of this continued expansion depends on our ability to maintain and develop an infrastructure appropriate to support and integrate such growth. Also, our success depends on the acceptance by customers of us and our services in these new markets and, in the case of expansion through acquisitions, our success depends on many factors, including the long-term recruitment and retention of key personnel and acquired customer relationships. The profitability of our expansion strategy also depends on whether the income we generate in the new markets will offset the increased expenses of operating a larger entity with increased personnel, more branch locations and additional product offerings.\nAll five of these challenges and risks - growing the net interest income, maintaining credit quality and rigorous risk management, competition in the marketplace, regulatory considerations and managing expansion, growth, and future acquisitions - have the potential to have a material adverse effect on United; however, we believe the Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks.\nSee also Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing United.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board.\nAllowance For Loan Losses\nCritical Estimates\nOur loan portfolio is segregated between originated loans which are accounted for under the amortized cost method and acquired loans which are originally recorded at fair value, resulting in no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. Loans accounted for under the amortized cost method are considered covered\u201d loans. For covered loans, we determine our allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment, which consists of owner-occupied and investor non-owner occupied commercial real estate, commercial and residential construction, commercial business, residential real estate, home equity and other consumer loans. Acquired non-impaired loans (referred to as acquired\u201d loans) are loans for which there is no evidence of deterioration subsequent to acquisition and therefore have no allowance for loan losses associated with them. Certain acquired loans carry an allowance for loan losses when there has been measured credit deterioration in the loans subsequent to acquisition such that a reserve is required. These acquired loans, for which an allowance is established, are also considered covered loans.\nCovered loans\nWe establish our allowance for loan losses through a provision for credit losses. The level of the allowance for loan losses is based on our evaluation of the credit quality of our loan portfolio. This evaluation, which includes a review of loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical net loan loss experience, and other factors that warrant recognition in determining our allowance for loan losses. We continue to monitor and modify the level of our allowance for loan losses to ensure it is adequate to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur allowance for loan losses consists of the following elements: (i) valuation allowances based on net historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar inherent risk characteristics and performance trends, adjusted, as appropriate, for qualitative risk factors specific to respective loan types; and (ii) specific valuation allowances based on probable losses on specifically identified impaired loans. The covered portfolio consists of organic performing loans, refinanced acquired loans which have undergone a full underwriting review as well as performing acquired loans which have evidenced measured credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition, but are not deemed impaired.\nImpaired loans\nWhen current information and events indicate that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts of principal and interest when due under the original terms of a business, construction or commercial real estate loan greater than $100,000, such loan will be classified as impaired. Additionally, all loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\") are considered impaired. The need for specific valuation allowances are determined for impaired loans and recorded as necessary. For impaired loans, we consider the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent, or we use the present value of estimated future cash flows in determining the estimates of impairment and any related allowance for loan losses for these loans. Confirmed losses are charged off immediately at the time a loan becomes impaired. We typically would obtain an appraisal through our internal loan grading process to use as the basis for the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nCommercial loan portfolio\nWe estimate the allowance for our commercial loan portfolio by applying historical loss rates to loans based on their type and loan grade. This amount is then adjusted, as necessary, for qualitative considerations to reflect changes in underwriting, market or industry conditions, or based on changes in trends in the composition of the portfolio, including risk composition, seasoning, and underlying collateral. Our loan grading system is described in Note 7, Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d found in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nConsumer loan portfolio\nWe estimate the allowance for loan losses for our consumer loan portfolio based on our historical net loss experience. This amount is then adjusted, as necessary, for qualitative considerations to reflect changes in underwriting, market or industry conditions or based on changes in trends in the composition of the portfolio, including risk composition, seasoning, and underlying collateral. Qualitative considerations include, but are not limited to, the evaluation of trends in property values and unemployment.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nWe determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by analyzing and estimating losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for loan losses contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to use historical information as well as current economic data to make judgments on the adequacy of the allowance. As the allowance is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors, it may impact the portfolio in a way currently unforeseen.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAdverse changes in management's assessment of the factors used to determine the allowance for loan losses could lead to additional provisions. Actual loan losses could differ materially from management's estimates if actual losses and conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized. These factors and conditions include general economic conditions within United's market, industry trends and concentrations, real estate and other collateral values, interest rates and the financial condition of the individual borrower. While management believes that it has established adequate specific and general allowances for probable losses on loans, actual results may prove different and the differences could be significant.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities\nCritical Estimates\nThe Company maintains a securities portfolio that is classified into two major categories: available for sale and held to maturity. Securities available for sale are recorded at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. Held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost. Management determines the classifications of a security at the time of its purchase.\nQuarterly, securities with unrealized losses are reviewed as deemed appropriate to assess whether the decline in fair value is temporary or other-than-temporary. The assessment is to determine whether the decline in value is from company-specific events, industry developments, general economic conditions, credit losses on debt or other reasons. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost or amortized cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings for equity securities and for debt securities that have an identified credit loss. Unrealized losses on debt securities beyond the identified credit loss component are reflected in other comprehensive income.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nSignificant judgment is involved in determining when a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. The factors considered by management include, but are not limited to:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Percentage and length of time by which an issue is below book value;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including their ability to meet contractual obligations in a timely manner;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ratings of the security;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Whether the decline is due to interest rates and spreads or credit risk;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The value of underlying collateral; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in the market value, or more likely than not, will be required to sell a debt security before its anticipated recovery which may not be until maturity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAdverse changes in management's assessment of the factors used to determine that a security was not other-than-temporarily impaired could lead to additional impairment charges. A decline in fair value that we determined to be temporary could become other-than-temporary and warrant an impairment charge. Additionally, a security that had no apparent risk could be affected by a sudden or acute market condition and necessitate an impairment charge.\nIncome Taxes\nCritical Estimates\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's asset and liabilities. The realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years' taxable income, to which carry back\u201d refund claims could be made. A valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. Furthermore, tax positions that could be deemed uncertain are required to be disclosed and reserved for if it is is more likely than not that the position would not be sustained upon audit examination.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Some judgments are subjective and involve estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. In determining the valuation allowance, we use historical and forecasted future operating results, based upon approved business plans, including a review of the eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. In determining the level of reserve needed for uncertain tax positions, we consider relevant current legislation and court rulings, among other authoritative items, to determine the level of exposure inherent in tax positions of the Company. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions are a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance and changes in tax legislation could result in the need for additional tax reserves.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nShould actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management, the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset and tax positions taken could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. If the Company is not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future or if a tax position is overturned by a taxing authority, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made.\nGoodwill\nCritical Estimates\nGoodwill represents the amount the Company paid as a result of acquisitions in excess of the related fair value of net assets acquired. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analysis, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen goodwill is evaluated for impairment, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to income. The fair value is based on observable market prices, when practicable. Other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable, including estimated discounted cash flows and market multiples analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. In the event of future changes in fair value, the Company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill by performing an internal valuation analysis, and determined there was no impairment. Through year end, no events or circumstances subsequent to the annual testing date indicate that the carrying value of the Company's goodwill may not be recoverable, therefore, no interim testing was required.\nThe carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2017 was $115.3 million. For further discussion on goodwill see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nFair value is determined using quantitative analysis and widely accepted valuation techniques, including estimated future cash flows, comparable transactions, control premium and market peers. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nIf actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Management has evaluated the effect of lowering the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and determined no goodwill impairment was necessary under accounting guidance for goodwill impairment.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nCritical Estimates\nCurrently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payment) and the expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payment (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rates curves.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nDetermining the fair value of interest rate derivatives requires the use of the standard market methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise based upon the forward swap curve assumption and netting the cash receipt against the contractual cash payment observed at the instrument's effective date. The Company's estimates of variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The Company further incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty's non-performance risk in the fair value measurements and requirements for collateral transfer to secure the market value of the derivative instrument(s).\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAlthough the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of the current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of non-performance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. Incorrect assumptions could result in an overstatement or understatement of the value of the derivative contract.\nOperating Results\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

the Company recorded $49.7 million in earnings, or $0.99 per diluted share. The efficiency ratio continued to be reflective of the Company's expense management strategy and was 61.72% and 62.29% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company recorded strong organic loan growth during the year, and participated in strategic loan portfolio purchases throughout 2017. Loan originations and purchases totaled $2.05 billion in 2017 compared to $1.66 billion in 2016. The loan portfolio purchases added $242.9 million of loans to the balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2017, which supports the Company's efforts to geographically diversify and shift the composition of the loan portfolio into favorable consumer products with more favorable risk adjusted returns.\nNet interest income increased primarily due to the increase in average interest-earning assets of $387.4 million, which primarily reflects organic loan growth and the loan portfolio purchases. The Company's tax-equivalent net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.01%, an increase of 5 basis points over the prior year of 2.96%. Net interest income increased $13.1 million, or 7.7%, compared to 2016. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by an increase in total average interest- bearing liabilities of $368.8 million compared to 2016. Interest and dividend income increased by $25.4 million and the yield on interest-earning assets increased by 18 basis points mostly due to the increase in yields on investment securities, residential real estate, commercial business, construction, and home equity loans due to the current interest rate environment and strategic initiatives. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the yields on other consumer loans, while the yields on commercial real estate loans remained flat year-over-year. Interest-bearing liabilities increased to fund new loan growth and loan portfolio purchases. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $11.0 million and the yield increased 14 basis points. Purchase accounting adjustments increased net interest income by $176,000 and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe asset quality of our loan portfolio has remained strong, including loans acquired from Legacy United and the purchased portfolios. Acquired loans are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 0.88% and 0.87%, the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans ratio was 148.76% and 125.64%, and the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.59% and 0.69% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A provision for loan losses of $9.4 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company continues to ensure consistent application of risk ratings across the entire portfolio. We believe asset quality for the Company remains strong and stable.\nThe Company experienced an increase in non-interest income of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016. This increase was driven primarily by (a) service charges and fees; predominantly loan swap fee income and revenue generated by the Company's investment advisory subsidiary, United Northeast Financial Advisors, Inc. and (b) an increase in BOLI income. Offsetting these were decreases in income from mortgage banking activities and net gain on sale of securities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest expense increased $7.6 million over the comparative period in 2016. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits, which was a result of more full-time employees in 2017 compared to 2016 to support growth initiatives. In addition, occupancy and equipment increased by $1.9 million compared to 2016.\nThe Company experienced an increase in the provision for income taxes of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax net income and a decreased amount of tax credits recognized during the year.\nComparison of 2016 and 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded earnings of $49.7 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, compared to 2015 when the Company recorded $49.6 million in earnings, or $1.00 per diluted share. The efficiency ratio continued to be reflective of the Company's expense management strategy and was 62.26% and 60.99% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded strong organic loan growth during the year as well as participating in strategic loan portfolio purchases throughout 2016. Loan originations totaled $1.33 billion in 2016 compared to $1.58 billion in 2015. The loan portfolio purchases added $154.2 million of loans to the balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2016 and consisted of HELOCs which supports the Company's efforts to geographically diversify and shift the composition of the loan portfolio into favorable consumer products with more favorable risk adjusted returns.\nNet interest income increased primarily due to the increase in net average interest-earning assets of $666.4 million, which primarily reflects organic loan growth and the loan portfolio purchases. The Company's tax-equivalent net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 2.96%, a decrease of 23 basis points over the prior year of 3.19%. Net interest income increased\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n$6.5 million, or 4.0%, compared to 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of $666.4 million, partially offset by an increase in total interest bearing liabilities of $600.9 million compared to 2015. Interest and dividend income increased by $16.7 million and the yield on interest earning assets decreased by 15 basis points mostly due to the decrease in yields on residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial business loans and construction loans due to the current interest rate environment. These decreases were partially offset by increases in the yields on home equity loans and other consumer loans. Interest bearing liabilities increased to fund new loan growth and loan portfolio purchases. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased $9.3 million and the yield increased 10 basis points. Purchase accounting adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016 had the effect of increasing net interest income by $2.7 million compared to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe asset quality of our loan portfolio remained strong, including loans acquired from Legacy United and the purchased portfolios. Acquired loans were recorded at fair value with no carryover of the allowance for loan losses and, as such, some asset quality measures are not comparable between periods as a result. The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 0.87% and 0.73%, the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans ratio was 125.64% and 89.64%, and the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.69% and 0.82% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A provision for loan losses of $13.4 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $13.0 million for year ended December 31, 2015. The Company continues to ensure consistent application of risk ratings across the entire portfolio. We believe asset quality for the Company remains strong and stable.\nThe Company experienced a decrease in non-interest income of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015. This decrease is driven primarily by decreases in service charges and fees, predominantly loan swap fee income and decreases on the gain on sale of loans, which is due to a decrease in transactional volume. These decreases were offset by increases in debit card fees and wealth management fee income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, non-interest expense increased $5.8 million over the comparative period in 2015. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to the increases in salaries and employee benefits, which was a direct result of severance payments associated with the Company's previously announced retail reorganization plan and the hiring of experienced information technology personnel. In addition, the Company incurred $1.5 million in FHLBB prepayment penalties in the first quarter of 2016.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Balances, Net Interest Income, Average Yields/Costs and Rate/Volume Analysis:\nThe following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated.

exceeds the cost of funds, interest paid to the Company's depositors and interest on external borrowings. Net interest margin is the difference between the income on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing funds as a percentage of average earning assets. Growth in net interest income has resulted mainly from the origination of in interest-earning assets and liabilities.\nComparison of 2017 and 2016\nAs shown in the tables above, tax-equivalent net interest income increased $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, the net interest margin increased five basis points to 3.01%, the yield on average earning assets increased 18 basis points to 3.83%, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 14 basis points to 0.96%, compared to 0.82% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net interest income reflects amortization and accretion of credit and interest rate marks on the acquired loans, time deposits and borrowings which resulted in a increase in net interest income of $176,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a $2.7 million increase in net interest income for the comparable 2016 period.\nPrimarily reflecting loan growth and portfolio purchases, average earning assets increased $387.4 million and average interest-bearing liabilities increased $368.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Average interest bearing liabilities increased due to deposit growth and borrowings which were used to fund the loan growth and portfolio purchases. The average balance of loans and investment securities increased $408.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively, while the average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $374.2 million.\nThe increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflects the loan growth and portfolio purchases. The average balance of total loans at December 31, 2017 was $5.16 billion and had an average yield of 3.94%. The average balance of commercial business loans totaled $779.3 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $133.0 million year-over-year. The average balances of residential real estate loans, home equity loans, commercial real estate loans and other consumer loans were the other significant\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ndrivers of the increase in the average loan balance year-over-year, which increased $77.2 million, $82.1 million, $119.8 million and $26.9 million, respectively.\nThe average balance of investment securities increased $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, while the average yield earned increased 30 basis points. The majority of the increase in the yield resulted from increases in the LIBOR index, which is the basis for the CLO portfolio, as well as overall portfolio management.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $368.8 million to $5.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was 0.96%, compared to 0.82% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear-over-year, average balances of total interest-bearing deposits increased $374.2 million and the average cost increased 13 basis points to 0.79%. These increases were primarily due to deposit growth in NOW and money market accounts. FHLBB advances decreased $10.2 million to $978.7 million, while the average cost increased 30 basis points to 1.29% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other borrowings increased $4.7 million and the cost decreased four basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016.\nNet interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, loan and deposit pricing strategies, competitive conditions, the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the level of non-performing assets. Therefore, the Company manages the risk of changes in interest rates on its net interest income through ALCO and through related interest rate risk monitoring and management policies.\nComparison of 2016 and 2015\nAs shown in the tables above, tax-equivalent net interest income increased $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, the net interest margin decreased 23 basis points to 2.96%, the yield on average earning assets decreased 14 basis points to 3.65%, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased ten basis points to 0.82%. The fair value adjustments reflect amortization and accretion of credit and interest rate marks on the acquired loans, time deposits and borrowings which resulted in an increase in net interest income of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a $12.7 million increase in net interest income for the comparable 2015 period.\nPrimarily reflecting loan growth and portfolio purchases, average earning assets increased $666.4 million and average interest-bearing liabilities increased $600.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Average interest bearing liabilities increased due to deposit growth and borrowings which were used to fund the loan growth and portfolio purchases. The average balance of loans increased $663.2 million and the average balance of investment securities decreased $15.5 million. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $310.5 million.\nThe increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflects the loan growth and portfolio purchases. The average balance of total loans at December 31, 2016 was $4.75 billion and had an average yield of 3.79%. The average balance of commercial real estate loans totaled $2.06 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $279.0 million year-over-year. The average balances of residential real estate loans, home equity loans, commercial business loans and other consumer loans were the other significant drivers of the increase in the average loan balance year-over-year, which increased $45.6 million, $121.4 million, $35.9 million and $193.8 million, respectively.\nThe average balance of investment securities decreased $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, while the average yield earned increased 6 basis points. The majority of this increase resulted from new investment purchases which were made in order to keep the portfolio in line with a targeted percentage of assets, coupled with the reinvestment of runoff cash flows of the portfolio.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $600.9 million to $5.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $4.40 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was 0.82%, compared to 0.72% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nYear-over-year, average balances of total interest-bearing deposits increased $310.5 million and the average cost increased six basis points to 0.66%. These increases were primarily due to deposit growth in all categories except for savings accounts. FHLBB advances increased $324.2 million to $988.8 million, while the average cost increased 29 basis points to 0.99% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other borrowings decreased $33.8 million and the cost increased 86 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in FHLBB advances was due to funding new loan growth. The decrease in other borrowings was due to maturing repurchase agreement advances.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, loan and deposit pricing strategies, competitive conditions, the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the level of non-performing assets. Therefore, the Company manages the risk of changes in interest rates on its net interest income through ALCO and through related interest rate risk monitoring and management policies.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by the Company. The level of the allowance is a critical accounting estimate, which is subject to uncertainty. Acquired loans are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, with no carryover of the allowance for loan losses, which includes adjustments for market interest rates and expected credit losses. Included within the allowance for loan losses are reserves for acquired loans, in accordance with Bank policies, which have evidenced a deterioration subsequent to acquisition.\nManagement evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. The adequacy of the loan loss allowance is based on such interrelated factors as the composition of the loan portfolio and its inherent risk characteristics, the level of non-performing loans and charge-offs, both current and historic, local economic and credit conditions, the direction of real estate values, and regulatory guidelines. The provision is charged against earnings in order to maintain an allowance for loan losses that reflects management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.\nManagement recorded a provision of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary factors that influenced management's decision to record this provision were organic loan growth during the year, slowing migration to covered loans, the on-going assessment of estimated exposure on impaired loans, level of delinquencies, and general economic conditions. Impaired loans totaled $45.9 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $50.1 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $4.2 million or 8.4%, reflecting decreases in all impaired loan categories except residential real estate and home equity impaired loans. Commercial business, other consumer, investor non-owner occupied commercial real estate, construction, and owner-occupied commercial real estate impaired loans decreased $2.1 million, $1.8 million, $1.5 million, $1.1 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in residential real estate and home equity impaired loans of $1.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nThe repayment of these impaired loans is largely dependent upon the sale and value of collateral that may be impacted by current real estate conditions. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses totaled $47.1 million, which represented 0.88% of total loans and 148.76% of non-performing loans compared to an allowance for loan losses of $42.8 million, which represented 0.87% of total loans and 125.64% of non-performing loans as of December 31, 2016.\nNon-Interest Income Analysis\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, non-interest income represented 15.3%, 15.0% and 16.6% of total revenues, respectively. The following is a summary of non-interest income by major category for the years presented:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(781\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from mortgage banking activities\n</td> <td>5,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank-owned life insurance income\n</td> <td>5,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(222\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of securities, net\n</td> <td>782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,179\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss on limited partnership investments\n</td> <td>(3,023\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,995\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,136\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(859\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of 2017 and 2016\nAs displayed in the above table, non-interest income increased $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company experienced increases in all categories year-over-year except in net gain from sales of securities and income from mortgage banking activities.\nService Charges and Fees: Service charges and fees were $24.2 million and $20.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $4.0 million from the comparable 2016 period. The most significant increases were\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nrecorded in loan swap fee income, revenue generated by the Company's investment advisory subsidiary (UNFA), and transaction fees on customer products.\nRevenue generated from loan swap fee income increased due to higher transaction volume as well as the total corresponding notional value. Loan swap fee income is generated as part of the Company's loan level hedge program that is offered to certain commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The increased revenue generated by UNFA is due to the Company's continued strategy of acquiring proven talent with deep local relationships as well as installing Series 6 representatives in select branches to work alongside our retail employees to ensure a coordinated sales approach to meeting the financial needs of our customers. Additionally, during 2016 the Company shifted focus to assets under management ( AUM\u201d) for ongoing revenue versus a transactional approach; the result is more recurring fee revenue driven by increasing AUM versus one-time fees generated by transactions. AUM increased approximately $150.0 million year-over-year, to $460.0 million in 2017 from $312.0 million in 2016. The increase in transaction fees for various customer products is linked to the Company implementing a new fee structure that is more in line with our competition based on a detailed study. The Company instituted the new fee structure in July 2016, therefore, only six months of the comparative period was affected by this initiative. Additionally, NSF fees increased in the current period, primarily due to a higher volume of related transactions and a modification of the fee structure.\nIncome From Mortgage Banking Activities: Income from mortgage banking activities was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 32.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value recognized in net income for mortgage servicing rights due to a decrease in long-term rates and a decrease in gains on sale of loans, resulting from a decrease in sales volumes compared to the prior year. The Company did not immediately sell the current year originations as part of its strategy to hold the loans longer, which resulted in shifting income from gain on sale to net interest income. Loans held for sale increased to $114.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $62.5 million at December 31, 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases in mortgage loan servicing income reflecting a serviced- for-others portfolio balance increase to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017 from $1.05 billion at December 31, 2016 and an increase in the mortgage servicing rights derivative that was established to partly mitigate mortgage servicing rights valuation losses in a declining rate environment.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance Income ( BOLI\u201d): BOLI income was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.1 million, or 60.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is driven by the Bank's $40 million purchase of new BOLI policies in December 2016, which generated $1.4 million of income in 2017. Furthermore, the Bank received an additional $806,000 in 2017 from death benefit settlements.\nGain on Sales of Securities, Net: For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company realized a net gain of $782,000 compared to a net gain of $2.0 million for the prior year, which was mainly driven by the sale of shorter-term securities, adding longer duration investments in the portfolio to optimize income as well as improving portfolio efficiency from a credit and regulatory capital perspective.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company took advantage of the shape of the yield curve and sold shorter-term securities and added longer duration investments in the portfolio to optimize income and reduce higher-cost borrowings. The Company then also incurred approximately $1.5 million in prepayment penalty expense from the extinguishment of FHLBB debt as part of the optimization strategy which is recorded as a separate line item in non-interest expense.\nNet Loss on Limited Partnership Investments: The Company has investments in low income housing tax credit, new markets housing tax credit and alternative energy tax credit partnerships. In March 2017 and 2016, the Company invested an additional $3.6 million and $12.7 million in alternative energy tax credit partnerships, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $3.0 million in losses on limited partnership investments compared to $4.0 million in the prior year period. The passage of the Tax Act in December 2017 contributed $1.2 million to the current year loss. In conjunction with the loss realized on the tax credit partnerships, the Company recorded an offsetting tax credit benefit of $9.6 million as reflected in the income tax provision for the year.\nOther Income: The Company recorded an increase in other income of $193,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The change from the prior year is primarily due to the increase in the credit value adjustments on borrower facing loan level hedges and higher gains on the sale of other real estate owned. These increases were partially offset by higher losses on sales of fixed assets, mainly due to the sale of a bank owned property.\nComparison of 2016 and 2015\nAs displayed in the above table, non-interest income decreased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company experienced decreases in all categories year-over-year except in net gain from sales of securities.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nService Charges and Fees: Service charges and fees were $20.3 million and $21.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $781,000 from the comparable 2015 period. The most significant decrease was recorded in loan swap fee income, partially offset by increases in revenue generated by UNFA and transaction fees.\nThe decrease in loan swap fees was a direct result of lower transactional volume. The loan swap fee income is generated as part of the Company's loan level hedge program that is offered to certain commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The increased revenue generated by UNFA is due to several factors. The Company has successfully acquired proven talent with deep local relationships as well as installing Series 6 representatives in select branches which work alongside our retail employees to ensure a cohesive sales approach to meeting the financial needs of our customers. Additionally, the Company has shifted it's strategy in running this business line. The Company has shifted focus to AUM for ongoing revenue versus a transactional approach; the result is more recurring fee revenue driven by increasing AUM versus one-time fees generated by transactions. The increase in transaction fees was driven by a project undertaken by the Company which focused on increasing profitability by implementing a deposit fee structure more in line with our competition based on a detailed study. As a result, starting with July 2016, the Company recorded revenue increases in the areas of service charges and fees targeted by the project.\nIncome From Mortgage Banking Activities: Income from mortgage banking activities was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 13.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in gains on sales of loans, resulting from a decrease in sales volumes compared to the prior year. The Company did not immediately sell the current year originations which resulted in higher net interest income as loans held for sale increased to $62.5 million at December 31, 2016 from $10.1 million at December 31, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by the increases in (a) loan servicing income driven by gains from an increase in the number of serviced loans, (b) the change in the fair value recognized in net income for mortgage servicing rights due to an increase on long-term rates, and (c) the net increase in value of forward loan sales contracts and derivative rate lock commitments due to market interest rate changes.\nBank Owned Life Insurance Income ( BOLI\u201d): BOLI income was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $222,000, or 6.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease is due to changes in the average yield earned on BOLI policies as a result of current market interest rates. Furthermore, the Company experienced a decrease in death benefits in 2016 compared to 2015. These decreases were partially offset by the additional purchase of $40.0 million of BOLI late in December 2016.\nGain on Sales of Securities, Net: For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company realized a net gain of $2.0 million compared to a net gain of $939,000 in the prior year resulting from (a) sales of certain securities to reduce exposure to healthcare municipal bonds due to changes in healthcare sector, (b) the Company repositioning certain securities as these securities became punitive to capital to hold on a go-forward basis due to regulatory changes, (c) sales of municipal bonds that were expected to be called, (d) reducing concentration in oil dependent securities, (e) efforts to make the portfolio more efficient to manage from an operational perspective and (f) an optimization strategy of our investment portfolio in which we took advantage of the shape of the yield curve. The Company incurred $1.5 million in prepayment penalty expense from the extinguishment of FHLBB advances as part of the optimization strategy, which is recorded as a separate line item in non-interest expense.\nNet Loss on Limited Partnership Investments: The Company has investments in low income housing tax credit, new markets housing tax credit and alternative energy tax credit partnerships. In March 2016, the Company invested an additional $12.7 million in a new alternative energy tax credit partnership.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $4.0 million in losses on limited partnership investments compared to $3.1 million in the prior year period. In conjunction with the loss realized on the tax credit partnerships, the Company recorded an offsetting benefit of $10.5 million as reflected in the income tax provision for the year.\nOther Income: The Company recorded a decrease in other income of $238,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. This decrease year-over-year is primarily due to the decline in the credit value adjustments on borrower facing loan level hedges and lower gains on the sale of other real estate owned. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in miscellaneous income, which was mainly driven by the gains recorded in the Company's investment in a group life mortgage insurance program upon its dissolution.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-Interest Expense Analysis\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, non-interest expense represented 2.08%, 2.10% and 2.25% of average assets, respectively.

from $134.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSalaries and Employee Benefits: Salaries and employee benefits represented the largest increase in non-interest expense. Salaries and employee benefits was $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.7 million from the comparable 2016 period. Salary expense increased $3.3 million due to: (a) the hiring of additional staff in areas targeted for growth, (b) an increase in FICA related to higher salary expenses, (c) an increase in executive restricted stock expense as a result of stock awards granted in 2016 and 2017, increasing the number of unvested shares being expensed and (d) a decrease in deferred expenses from loan originations also contributed to the overall increase in salaries and benefits. These increases were partially offset by decreases in health insurance costs and temporary help due to the completion of projects.\nOccupancy and Equipment Expense: Occupancy and equipment expense increased $1.9 million to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily driven by: (a) the move of corporate headquarters to Hartford, CT which resulted in an increase in rent expense and depreciation on leasehold improvements, (b) expenses for maintenance contracts due to higher snow removal costs in 2017, (c) the outsourcing of property management services which began in July 2016 and (d) depreciation on various software programs.\nService Bureau Fees: Service bureau fees increased $112,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the 2016 period. The increase is primarily attributable to the Company's core service provider providing a higher level of custom work in the current year, partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with the deployment of Europay, MasterCard and Visa ( EMV\u201d) chip-enabled debit and credit cards. EMV cards are a part of the Company's strategy in mitigating potential fraud expenses to the Company's credit and debit card users.\nProfessional Fees: Professional fees were $4.3 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $388,000. The increase over the prior year is mainly driven by expenses related to the engagement for services assisting in projects targeted to maximize non-interest income revenue streams, legal services related to tax matters regarding a new partnership investment and corporate development opportunities.\nMarketing and Promotions: Marketing and promotions expense was $4.0 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $998,000. The increase was primarily attributable to expenses related to production, digital advertising and social media marketing, partially offset by decreases in television and newspaper advertising. Production expenses increased, as well as digital and social media marketing, as the Company favored these online marketing channels during the year and relied less on television and newspaper advertising to reach our target market.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFDIC Insurance Assessments: The expense for FDIC insurance assessments decreased $497,000 to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the assessment rate and the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio exceeding established benchmarks which became effective in the third quarter of 2016.\nCore Deposit Intangible Amortization: The $193,000 decrease in core deposit intangible amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 is due to the amortization method used by the Company. The Company is amortizing the core deposit intangible of $10.6 million over 10 years using the sum-of-the-years-digits method.\nFHLBB Prepayment Penalties: For the year ended December 31, 2017 there were no prepayment penalties recorded by the Company. As part of the Company's investment portfolio optimization strategy implemented in the first quarter of 2016, the Company sold investment securities and recorded gains of $1.5 million and prepaid FHLBB advances with prepayment penalties totaling $1.5 million.\nOther Expenses: Other expenses were $23.7 million and $22.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $1.7 million. The increase is primarily due to (a) computer software and maintenance expenses due to technology projects, (b) loan swap fees as the Company entered into more swaps in 2017 and (c) an increase in other real estate owned expenses. The increases were partially offset by lower expenses related to: (a) sales and use taxes associated with a state tax audit in the prior year, (b) lower collection expenses as the Company experienced higher expenditures in the prior year associated with special assets and (c) mortgage appraisal and credit reports.\nProvision for Income Taxes: The provision for income taxes was $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the tax expense is primarily due to higher pre-tax net income and a decreased amount of tax credits recognized during the year. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 18.1% and 7.6%, respectively. The rate change was a result of the Tax Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017, resulting in, amongst other tax reform items, a reduction in the Company's applicable US Federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As a result of this rate reduction and changes in other provisions of the new law, the Company incurred $1.8 million of additional tax expense as of December 31, 2017 primarily due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax asset. The impact of tax reform is based upon reasonable estimates of new current and deferred taxes based on certain provision within the Tax Act.\nComparison of 2016 and 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, non-interest expense increased $5.8 million to $134.0 million from $128.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSalaries and Employee Benefits: Salaries and employee benefits represented the largest increase in non-interest expense. Salaries and employee benefits was $75.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $7.9 million from the comparable 2015 period. Salary expense was the primary driver of the increase due to the hiring of additional staff in areas targeted for growth and severance payments of $1.4 million resulting from the Company's announced retail organizational realignment to improve operational efficiency. Other factors driving the increase included (a) increased employee incentives on product sales and corporate goal attainment, (b) an increase in restricted stock expense related to the implementation of a new shareholder approved stock plan, and (c) increased temporary help to maintain compensation flexibility while responding to growth requirements. These increases were partially offset by (a) decreases in various employee benefit expenses and (b) increases in deferred expenses from originating loans.\nOccupancy and Equipment Expense: Occupancy and equipment expense decreased $456,000 to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the following (a) rent expense related to a change in the estimate for deferred rents resulting from the Company's efforts to control expenses over the branch network and (b) expenses for maintenance contracts due to less snow removal costs in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by increases in (a) real estate taxes and (b) amortization of computer software associated with various projects.\nService Bureau Fees: Service bureau fees increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 2015 period. The increase is primarily attributable to (a) service bureau fees driven by the expiration of a service credit from the Company's core operating system provider and increased expenses from that service provider and (b) expenses associated with the deployment of Europay, MasterCard and Visa ( EMV\u201d) chip-enabled debit and credit cards. EMV cards are a part of the Company's strategy in mitigating potential fraud expenses.\nProfessional Fees: Professional fees were $3.9 million and $6.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease over the prior year is mainly driven by consulting contracts associated with the acquisition of the purchased loan portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as various engagements related to internal technology projects to\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nimprove efficiencies and operating leverage throughout 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in outsourced internal audit expenses.\nMarketing and Promotions: Marketing and promotions expense was $3.0 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $728,000. The increase was primarily attributable to expenses related to television, digital advertising, and radio branding campaign partially offset by a decrease in newspaper advertising.\nFDIC Insurance Assessments: The expense for FDIC insurance assessments decreased $119,000 to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the Company's lower assessment rate, which was partially offset by a higher assessment base used in the assessment calculation due to loan growth.\nCore Deposit Intangible Amortization: The $192,000 decrease in core deposit intangible amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the amortization method used by the Company. The Company is amortizing the core deposit intangible of $10.6 million over 10 years using the sum-of-the-years-digits method.\nMerger Related Expense: The were no merger related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Merger related expenses for 2015 were primarily the result of a change in control payment and associated expenses for an executive's departure in the fourth quarter.\nFHLBB Prepayment Penalties: For the year ended December 31, 2016, prepayment penalties recorded by the Company were $1.5 million. There were no prepayment penalties for the year ended December 31, 2015. As part of the Company's investment portfolio optimization strategy implemented in the first quarter of 2016, the Company sold investment securities and recorded gains of $1.5 million and prepaid FHLBB advances with prepayment penalties totaling $1.5 million.\nOther Expenses: Other expenses were $22.0 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $835,000. The decrease is primarily due to (a) loan swap fees as the Company entered into fewer swaps in 2016, (b) lower debit and ATM card losses as a result of the Company's efforts to minimize fraud exposure and (c) mortgage loan servicing fees. These decreases were partially offset by increases in (a) computer software and maintenance reflecting multiple efficiency projects; (b) sales and use taxes associated with a state tax audit and (c) collection expenses with higher expenditures associated with special assets.\nProvision for Income Taxes: The provision for income taxes was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in the tax expense is primarily due to an increased amount of tax credits recognized during the year. The Company's effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 7.6% and 11.1%, respectively.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nThe Company had total assets of $7.11 billion and $6.60 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase of $514.6 million, or 7.8%, is primarily due to organic loan growth and loan portfolio purchases. The Company utilized deposits, including brokered deposits and additional advances from the FHLBB to fund loan growth.\nTotal net loans of $5.31 billion, with an allowance for loan losses of $47.1 million at December 31, 2017, increased $437.1 million, or 9.0%, when compared to total net loans of $4.87 billion, with an allowance for loan losses of $42.8 million at December 31, 2016. Total deposits of $5.20 billion at December 31, 2017 increased $487.0 million, or 10.3%, when compared to total deposits of $4.71 billion at December 31, 2016. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased $70.5 million, or 10.0%, and interest-bearing deposits increased $416.5 million, or 10.4%, during the period. The increase in deposits is mainly due to growth in NOW accounts and money market deposits, and is reflective of the Company's new product specials and a continued focus on building commercial relationships. The Company's gross loan-to-deposit ratio was 102.7% and 104.0% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017, total equity of $693.3 million, increased $37.5 million, or 5.7%, when compared to total equity of $655.9 million at December 31, 2016. Changes in equity for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of net income, partially offset by dividends paid to common shareholders, as well as increases due to the change in market value on investment securities year-over-year, which reduced accumulated other comprehensive loss from the prior year. At December 31, 2017, the return on average tangible common equity ratio was 10.0% compared to 9.8% at December 31, 2016.

2017 and 2016. On a tax-equivalent basis, the yield in the securities portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 3.51% and 3.21%, respectively.\nThe Company designates its securities as held to maturity, available for sale or trading depending on the Company's intent regarding its investments at the time of purchase. The Company does not currently maintain a portfolio of trading securities. As of December 31, 2017, $1.05 billion, or 98.7%, of the portfolio, was classified as available for sale and $13.6 million of the portfolio was classified as held to maturity. The Company believes that the high concentration of securities available for sale allows flexibility in the day-to-day management of the overall investment portfolio, consistent with the objectives of optimizing profitability and mitigating both credit and interest rate risk. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Additional information about fair value measurements can be found in Note 6, Securities\u201d and Note 14, Fair Value Measurement\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nThe Company's underlying investment strategy has been to use the portfolio as a source of interest income, a tool to manage interest rate risk and as a source of liquidity. The transactions in the investment portfolio during the year were made with the goals of maintaining the barbell structure of the investment portfolio, increasing credit diversification and quality, and increasing interest income where possible. The Company continued to maintain the barbell structure of the portfolio in 2017 due to rising shorter\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 57\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nterm rates, combined with the overall flattening of the yield curve. The purchase of shorter duration investments such as floating rate collateralized loan obligations combined with purchases of longer duration municipal securities and corporate bonds to help the Company maintain the desired portfolio structure. Overall, in order to balance the portfolio's price risk with favorable cash flow characteristics, the Company continues to evaluate both shorter and longer duration securities that help protect against price risk and extension risk in aggregate, while providing more consistent cash flows.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the available for sale securities portfolio increased by $7.4 million to $1.05 billion, representing 14.8% of total assets at year-end 2017, from $1.04 billion and 15.8% of total assets at December 31, 2016. The increase is largely reflective of the deployment of additional capital in the portfolio in order to maintain the aforementioned barbell strategy. Portfolio activity during the year included repositioning in the municipal bond allocation to move up in credit quality and extending selected corporate holdings to take advantage of the relative steepness of the credit curve in various sectors. Additionally, in order to take advantage of the relative value of certain collateralized loan obligations, corporate bonds and agency mortgage backed securities; these security types were repositioned as well. The Company limits purchases in the municipal bonds, collateralized loan obligations and corporate sectors to investment grade or better rating prior to purchase. Furthermore, the Company limits its exposure to position parameters and will review the impact on the portfolio from periodic issuer disclosures, as well as developing market trends. Incremental portfolio growth for the year primarily focused on the purchase of cash flowing securities structured along the yield curve, and to a lesser extent, on municipal bonds and corporates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded no write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments of its securities. The Company held $682.3 million in securities that are in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2017. $292.0 million of this total had been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months with the remaining $390.3 million in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or longer. These securities were evaluated by management and were determined not to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company does not have the intent to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is more-likely-than-not that it will not have to sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis. To the extent that changes in interest rates, credit spread movements and other factors that influence the fair value of securities continue, the Company may be required to record impairment charges for other-than-temporary impairment in future periods. For additional information on the securities portfolio, see Note 6, Securities\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nThe Company monitors investment exposures continuously, performs credit assessments based on market data available at the time of purchase and performs ongoing credit due diligence for all collateralized loan obligations, corporate exposures and municipal securities. The Company's investment portfolio is regularly monitored for performance enhancements and interest rate risk profiles, with dynamic strategies implemented accordingly.\nThe composition and maturities of the Company's debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2017 are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the impact of prepayments or early redemptions that may occur. State agency and municipal obligations as well as common and preferred stock yields have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. Certain mortgage-backed securities have interest rates that are adjustable and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 58\n</td> <td>\n</td>

interest-rate risk as part of its asset/liability strategy. See Note 13, Derivatives and Hedging Activities\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information concerning derivative financial instruments.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI\u201d)\nBOLI was $148.3 million and $167.8 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At the end of 2017, the Company surrendered $33.1 million of under-performing BOLI policies, to subsequently be re-invested into higher yielding policies in early January 2018. Additionally, in December 2017, the Company purchased an additional $10.0 million of BOLI contracts. The Company expects to benefit from the BOLI contracts as a result of the tax-free growth in cash surrender value and death benefits that are expected to be generated over time. The purchase of the life insurance policy results in an income-earning asset on the Consolidated Statements of Condition that provides monthly tax-free income to the Company. The largest risk to the BOLI program is credit risk of the insurance carriers. To mitigate this risk, quarterly credit reviews are completed on all carriers. BOLI is invested in the general account\u201d, hybrid account\u201d, and separate account\u201d of quality insurance companies. Of the general account carriers, all were rated A-\u201d or better by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization at December 31, 2017. BOLI is\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 59\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nincluded on the Consolidated Statements of Condition at its cash surrender value. Increases in BOLI's cash surrender value are reported as a component of non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income.\nLending Activities\nThe Company originates and purchases residential real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residences, commercial real estate loans, residential and commercial construction loans, commercial business loans, multi-family loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and other consumer loans primarily throughout Connecticut and Massachusetts, and to a lesser extent the Northeast and certain Mid-Atlantic states.\nLoan Portfolio

2016. The Company experienced increases in most major loan categories due to organic loan growth and loan portfolio purchases that occurred during 2017.\nTotal commercial real estate loans represented the largest concentration of our loan portfolio at 44.5% of total loans at December 31, 2017 and increased $157.5 million, or 7.1%, to $2.38 billion from December 31, 2016, reflecting increased production from the Company's expanded commercial banking division. The commercial real estate loan portfolio is comprised of owner-occupied commercial real estate ( OOCRE\u201d) and investor non-owner occupied commercial real estate ( Investor CRE\u201d), and to a lesser extent, commercial construction. Investor CRE represents the largest segment of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017, comprising 34.7% of total loans and OOCRE represents 8.3% of the portfolio. The Company plans to increase the relative level of OOCRE while decreasing the relative level of Investor CRE to generate more favorable risk-adjusted returns and enhance net interest margin. Commercial real estate construction loans are made for developing commercial real estate properties such as office complexes, apartment buildings and residential subdivisions. Commercial real estate construction loans totaled $78.1 million at December 31, 2017, approximately $25.9 million of which is residential use and $52.2 million is commercial use, compared to total commercial real estate construction loans of $98.8 million at December 31, 2016, $35.4 million of which\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nwas residential use and $63.4 million was commercial use. The Company originates loans with interest reserves on certain commercial construction credits depending on various factors including, but not limited to, quality of credit, interest rate and project type. At December 31, 2017, the Company had three non-performing commercial construction loans totaling $1.4 million, with no funded interest reserves.\nResidential real estate loans continue to represent a significant segment of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017, comprising 22.6% of total loans, an increase of $48.2 million from December 31, 2016. The Company had originations of both adjustable and fixed rate mortgages of $589.2 million during the year, reflecting both refinancing activity and loans for new home purchases, and sold loans totaling $332.6 million in the secondary market. The Company currently sells the majority of all originated fixed rate residential real estate loans with terms of 30 years, but will also sell 10, 15 and 20 year loans depending on the circumstances. The mortgage origination activity resulted from low market interest rates and competitive pricing.\nResidential real estate construction loans totaled $40.9 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $53.9 million at December 31, 2016. Residential real estate construction segment loans are made to individuals for home construction whereby the borrower owns the parcel of land and the funds are advanced in stages until completion. The decrease of $13.0 million in residential construction loans is due to an overall decrease of residential construction loans in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nCommercial business loans increased $115.8 million to $840.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $724.6 million at December 31, 2016. The commercial division continues to experience momentum in origination activity and has a strong loan pipeline. Mid-sized businesses continue to look to community banks for relationship banking and personalized lending services. Periodically, the Company participates in a shared national credit ( SNC\u201d) program, which engages in the participation and purchase of credits with other supervised\u201d unaffiliated banks or financial institutions, specifically loan syndications and participations. These loans generate earning assets to increase profitability of the Company and diversify commercial loan portfolios by providing opportunities to participate in loans to borrowers in other regions or industries the Company might otherwise have no access. The Company offers both term and revolving commercial loans. Term loans have either fixed or adjustable rates of interest and, generally, terms of between three and seven years and amortize on the same basis. Additionally, two market segments the Company has focused on is franchise and educational banking. The franchise lending practice lends to certain franchisees in support of their development, acquisition, and expansion needs. The Company typically offers term loans with maturities between three to eight years with amortization from seven to ten years. These loans generally are on a floating rate basis with spreads slightly higher than the standard commercial business loan spreads. The educational banking practice consists of K-12 schools and colleges/universities utilizing both taxable and tax-exempt loan products for campus improvements, expansions and working capital needs. Generally, educational term loans have longer dated maturities that amortize up to 30 years and typically offer the Company a full deposit and cash management relationship. Both the franchise and educational lending areas focus on opportunities across New England and certain Mid-Atlantic states.\nThe Company also offers home equity loans and home equity lines of credit ( HELOCs\u201d), both of which are secured by one-to-four family residences. Home equity loans are offered with fixed rates of interest and with terms up to 15 years. At December 31, 2017 the home equity portfolio totaled $583.2 million compared to $536.8 million at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company purchased three HELOC portfolios totaling $105.2 million, compared to portfolios purchased totaling $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The total principal balance of the HELOC purchased portfolios outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $246.5 million and $208.8 million, respectively. These loans are not serviced by the Company. The purchased HELOC portfolios are secured by second liens. The Company may continue purchasing HELOCs throughout 2018 to maintain its existing exposure.\nOther consumer loans totaled $292.8 million, or 5.5%, of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. Other consumer loans generally consist of loans on retail high-end boats and small yachts, home improvement loans, new and used automobiles, loans collateralized by deposit accounts and unsecured personal loans. During December 2015, the Company purchased two consumer loan portfolios totaling $229.2 million which consisted of marine retail loans and home improvement loans. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $130.9 million and $168.7 million was outstanding, respectively. The marine retail loans are collateralized by premium brand boats. The home improvement loans are 90% backed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and consist of loans to install energy efficient upgrades to the borrowers' one-to-four family residences. The Company's plan seeks to marginally increase the level of consumer loans throughout 2018, given these loan types have favorable rate characteristics that will positively impact the net interest margin along with significant granularity and credit metrics that fit within the superior credit quality of its existing portfolio.\nLH-finance, the Company's marine lending unit, includes purchased and originated retail loans and dealer floorplan loans. The Company's relationships are limited to well established dealers of global premium brand manufacturers. The Company's top three manufacturer customers have been in business between 30 and 100 years. The Company has generally secured agreements with premium manufacturers to support dealer floor plan loans which may reduce the Company's credit exposure to the dealer, despite our underwriting of each respective dealer. We have developed incentive retail pricing programs with the dealers to drive\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nretail dealer flow. Retail loans are generally limited to premium manufacturers with established relationships with the Company which has a vested interest in the secondary market pricing of their respective brand due to the limited inventory available for resale. Consequently, while not contractually committed, manufacturers will often support secondary resale values which can have the effect of reducing losses from non-performing retail marine loans. Retail borrowers generally have very high credit scores, substantial down payments, substantial net worth, personal liquidity, and excess cash flow. Retail loans have an average life of four years and key markets include Florida, California, and New England.\nThe Company has employed specific parameters taking into account: geographical considerations, exposure hold levels, qualifying financial partners, and most importantly, sound credit quality with strong metrics. A thorough independent analysis of the credit quality of each borrower is made for every transaction whether it is an assignment or participation.\nLoan Maturity Schedule\nThe following table sets forth the loan maturity schedule at December 31, 2017:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Loans Maturing\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within One\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After One\nBut Within\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After Five\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owner-occupied CRE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>355,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>445,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investor CRE\n</td> <td>82,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>763,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,008,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,854,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>16,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial business loans\n</td> <td>135,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>462,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>840,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,161,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,204,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity\n</td> <td>9,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>583,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer\n</td> <td>1,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,472,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,615,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,339,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans Contractually Due Subsequent to December 31, 2018\nThe following table sets forth the scheduled repayments of fixed and adjustable rate loans at December 31, 2017 that are contractually due after December 31, 2018:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Due after December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fixed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owner-occupied CRE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>440,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investor CRE\n</td> <td>743,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,028,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,771,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>36,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial business loans\n</td> <td>193,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>704,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>741,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,203,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity\n</td> <td>40,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>533,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer\n</td> <td>220,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>291,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,097,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,990,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,088,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Quality\nUnited's lending strategy focuses on direct relationship lending within its primary market area as the quality of assets underwritten is an important factor in the successful operation of a financial institution. Non-performing assets, loan delinquency and credit loss levels are considered to be key measures of asset quality. Management strives to maintain asset quality through its underwriting standards, servicing of loans and management of non-performing assets since asset quality is a key factor in the determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses. See Note 7, Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d contained elsewhere in this report for further information concerning the Allowance for Loan Losses.\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Quality Ratios\nThe following table details asset quality ratios for the following periods:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At or For the Year December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At or For the Year December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans\n</td> <td>0.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets\n</td> <td>0.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans\n</td> <td>0.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans\n</td> <td>148.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-performing Assets\nGenerally loans are placed on non-accrual if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt, if the loan has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring, or if any payment of principal or interest is past due 90 days or more. A loan may be returned to accrual status if it has demonstrated sustained contractual performance for six continuous months or if all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period. There are, on occasion, circumstances that cause loans to be placed in the 90 days and accruing category, for example, loans that are considered to be well secured and in the process of collection or renewal. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, loans totaling $953,000 and $750,000, respectively, were greater than 90 days past due and accruing. The loans reported as past due 90 days or more and still accruing represent loans that were evaluated by management and maintained on accrual status based on an evaluation of the borrower.\nThe following table details non-performing assets for the periods presented:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owner-occupied commercial real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investor commercial real estate\n</td> <td>1,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>1,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial business loans\n</td> <td>1,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>11,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity\n</td> <td>4,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-accrual loans excluding TDRs\n</td> <td>23,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troubled debt restructurings - non-accruing\n</td> <td>8,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-performing loans\n</td> <td>31,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned\n</td> <td>2,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-performing assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-performing loans to total loans\n</td> <td>0.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.69\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-performing assets to total assets\n</td> <td>0.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs displayed in the above table, non-performing assets at December 31, 2017 decreased $2.1 million to $33.8 million compared to $36.0 million at December 31, 2016. Total non-accrual loans decreased $3.6 million, reflecting decreases in all categories except residential real estate and home equity non-accrual loans, offset by an increase of $1.2 million in non-accruing TDR loans, as compared to the previous year.\nAt December 31, 2017, commercial real estate non-accrual loans (including owner-occupied and investor non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans) decreased $3.2 million compared to December 31, 2016. The majority of the decrease was in investor non-owner occupied commercial real estate, accounting for $2.2 million of the total decrease, due to several smaller investment real estate loans which paid off or had reductions in balances during the year. Non-accrual construction loans decreased $303,000, primarily reflecting two commercial relationships totaling $1.4 million, which relate to construction for residential subdivisions. At December 31, 2016, non-accrual construction loans consisted of 11 commercial relationships and totaled $1.7 million.\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther consumer non-accrual loans decreased $965,000 to $35,000 at December 31, 2017. This decrease represents a decrease in non-accruing marine loans reported at December 31, 2017. The current balance represents one marine loan and two consumer loans which evidenced payments due in excess of 90 days and resulted in the loans being classified as non-accrual.\nCommercial business non-accrual loans decreased $523,000 to $1.5 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting decreases due to paid off smaller commercial business loans from the previous year ended December 31, 2016.\nHome equity and residential real estate non-accrual loans increased $925,000 and $467,000, respectively, from December 31, 2016. The increase in the home equity category reflects, in part, an increase in the number of maturing home equity lines of credit. The Company continues to originate loans with strong credit characteristics and routinely updates non-performing loans in terms of FICO scores and LTV ratios. Through continued heightened account monitoring, collections, and workout efforts, the Company is committed to mortgage solution programs designed to assist homeowners to remain in their homes. As has been its practice historically, the Company does not originate subprime loans.\nNon-accruing TDR loans increased by $1.2 million since December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase of $3.1 million in commercial business TDR loans, and to a lesser extent, an increase of $211,000 in home equity TDR loans, offset by decreases in all other non-accruing TDR categories. Investor non-owner occupied commercial real estate non-accrual TDR loans decreased $842,000, other consumer non-accruing TDR loans decreased $840,000, construction non-accruing TDR loans decreased $437,000, and owner-occupied commercial real estate non-accruing TDR loans decreased $21,000 from the year ended December 31, 2016. One larger commercial business relationship moved from an accruing TDR to a non-accruing TDR during the year ended December 31, 2017, which contributed towards the $3.1 million increase noted above.\nIf non-accrual loans had been performing in accordance with their original terms, the Company would have recorded $1.8 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million in additional interest income during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring\nLoans are considered restructured in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) when the Company has granted concessions to a borrower due to the borrower's financial condition that it otherwise would not have considered. These concessions include modifications of the terms of the debt such as reduction of the stated interest rate other than normal market rate adjustments, extension of maturity dates, or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest. The decision to restructure a loan, versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan, may benefit the Company by increasing the ultimate probability of collection.\nRestructured loans are classified as accruing or non-accruing based on management's assessment of the collectability of the loan. Loans which are already on non-accrual status at the time of the restructuring generally remain on non-accrual status for a minimum of six months before management considers such loans for return to accruing TDR status. Accruing restructured loans are placed into non-accrual status if and when the borrower fails to comply with the restructured terms and management deems it unlikely that the borrower will return to a status of compliance in the near term. Once a loan is classified as a TDR it retains that classification for the life of the loan; however, some TDRs may demonstrate acceptable performance allowing the TDR loan to be placed on accruing TDR status.\nThe following tables provide detail of TDR balances and activity for the periods presented:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recorded investment in TDRs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrual status\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual status\n</td> <td>8,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total recorded investment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accruing TDRs performing under modified terms more than one year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TDR allocated reserves included in the balance of allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td>520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional funds committed to borrowers in TDR status\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in TDRs of $628,000 primarily reflects $9.5 million in pay-offs and $756,000 in partial or full charge offs, partially offset by $9.6 million in new TDR loans which primarily consisted of one large investor non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan that was modified during the year. In addition, 21 home equity TDR loans, nine residential real estate TDR loans and five commercial business TDR loans were added during the 2017.\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

and still accruing totaled $953,000 and $750,000, respectively. Loans reported as 90 days or more and still accruing represent loans that were evaluated by management and maintained on accrual status based on an evaluation of the borrower.\nAs a percentage of total loans, loans between 30 and 90 days delinquent were 0.29% at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. All non-performing loans have been updated with a current appraised value, and if necessary, a reduction to carrying value has been made.\nPotential Problem Loans\nThe Company performs an internal analysis of the loan portfolio in order to identify and quantify loans with higher than normal risk. Loans having a higher risk profile are assigned a risk rating corresponding to the level of weakness identified in the loan. All loans risk rated Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful are listed on the Company's watchlist\u201d and are reviewed by management not less than on a quarterly basis to assess the level of risk and to ensure that appropriate actions are being taken to minimize potential loss exposure. Loans identified as containing loss are normally partially or fully charged off. In addition, the Company maintains a listing of classified loans\u201d consisting of Substandard and Doubtful loans which totaled $67.9 million at December 31, 2017 and which are generally transferred to the Special Assets or Collections area for enhanced monitoring.\nThe Company closely monitors the watchlist for signs of deterioration to mitigate the growth in non-accrual loans. At December 31, 2017, watchlist loans, inclusive of the classified loans\u201d, totaled $101.6 million, of which $60.7 million are not considered impaired. See the section titled Classified Assets in Part I, Item 1. Business found elsewhere in this report for further discussion on classification of potential problem loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments are maintained at a level estimated by management to provide for probable losses inherent within the loan portfolio. Probable losses are estimated based upon a quarterly review of the loan portfolio, which includes historic default and loss experience, specific problem loans, risk rating profile, economic conditions and other pertinent factors which, in management's judgment, warrant current recognition in the loss estimation process.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's senior management meet quarterly to review and conclude on the adequacy of the reserves, and to present their recommendation to the Board Risk Committee and the Board of Directors.\nManagement considers the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting estimate. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to considerable assumptions and judgment used in its determination. Therefore, actual losses could differ materially from management's estimate if actual conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized. These conditions include economic factors in the Company's market and nationally, industry trends and concentrations, real estate values and trends, and the financial condition and performance of individual borrowers. While management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of December 31, 2017, actual results may prove different and the differences could be significant.\nThe Company's general practice is to identify problem credits early and recognize full or partial charge-offs as promptly as practicable when it is determined that the collection of loan principal is unlikely. The Company recognizes full or partial charge-offs on collateral dependent impaired loans when the collateral is deemed to be insufficient to support the carrying value of the loan. The Company does not recognize a recovery when an updated appraisal indicates a subsequent increase in value.\nThe Company had a loan loss allowance of $47.1 million, or 0.88%, of total loans at December 31, 2017 as compared to a loan loss allowance of $42.8 million, or 0.87%, of total loans at December 31, 2016. The increase in the ratio from December 31, 2016 primarily reflects current year loan growth and the movement of loans from the acquired portfolio to the covered portfolio due to subsequent deterioration of credit quality in certain acquired portfolios. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and consistent with asset quality indicators and that it represents the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. There are three components for the allowance for loan loss calculation:\nGeneral component\nThe general component of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by the following loan segments: owner-occupied and investor non-owner commercial real estate, commercial and residential construction, commercial, residential real estate, home equity and other consumer. Due to the continued expansion and certain unique risk characteristics, the regional commercial real estate loans have been segmented from the total commercial real estate loan portfolio. The regional commercial real estate loans are located throughout the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states and tend to have above average debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios. Management uses a rolling average of historical losses based on a time frame appropriate to capture relevant loss data for each loan segment. This historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors: levels and trends in delinquencies; level and trend of charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and types of loans; effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, experience and depth of lending teams; weighted-average risk rating trends; and national and local economic trends and conditions. The qualitative factors are determined based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment. The general component of the allowance for loan and lease loss also includes a reserve based upon historical loss experience for loans which were acquired and have subsequently evidenced measured credit deterioration following initial acquisition. Our acquired loan portfolio is comprised of purchased loans that show no evidence of deterioration subsequent to acquisition and are therefore not part of the covered portfolio. Acquired impaired loans are loans with evidence of deterioration subsequent to acquisition and are considered in the covered portfolio in establishing the allowance for loan loss.\nFor acquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed borrower credit scores and refreshed loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratios, some of which are not immediately available as of the purchase date. The Company continues to evaluate this information and other credit-related information as it becomes available. ASC 310-30 addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from the Company's initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to deterioration in credit quality.\nAllocated component\nThe allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial, commercial real estate and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. Updated property evaluations are obtained at the time of impairment and serve as the basis for the loss allocation if foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans which are placed on non-accrual status, or deemed troubled debt restructures, are considered impaired by the Company and subject\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nto impairment testing for possible partial or full charge-off when loss can be reasonably determined. Generally, when all contractual payments on a loan are not expected to be collected, or the loan has failed to make contractual payments for a period of 90 days or more, a loan is placed on non-accrual status. In accordance with the Company's loan policy, losses on open and closed end consumer loans are recognized within a period of 120 days past due. For commercial loans, there is no threshold in terms of days past due for losses to be recognized as a result of the complexity in reasonably determining losses within a set time frame. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.\nWhen a loan is determined to be impaired, the Company makes a determination if the repayment of the obligation is collateral dependent. As a majority of impaired loans are collateralized by real estate, appraisals on the underlying value of the property securing the obligation are utilized in determining the specific impairment amount that is allocated to the loan as a component of the allowance calculation. If the loan is collateral dependent, an updated appraisal is obtained within a short period of time from the date the loan is determined to be impaired; typically no longer than 30 days for a residential property and 90 days for a commercial real estate property. The appraisal and the appraised value are reviewed for adequacy and then further discounted for estimated disposition costs and the period of time until resolution, in order to determine the impairment amount. The Company updates the appraised value at least annually and on a more frequent basis if current market factors indicate a potential change in valuation.\nThe majority of the Company's loans are collateralized by real estate located in central and eastern Connecticut and western Massachusetts in addition to a portion of the commercial real estate loan portfolio located in the Northeast region of the United States. Accordingly, the collateral value of a substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio and real estate acquired through foreclosure is susceptible to changes in market conditions in these areas.\nUnallocated component\nAn unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio. The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan loss at December 31, 2017 amounted to $1.7 million, an increase of $289,000 compared to December 31, 2016.\nSee Note 7, Loans Receivable and Allowance

compared to the December 31, 2016 year-end balance of $42.8 million. The Company provided $9.4 million of allowance for loan loss provisions in 2017. The Company recorded total loan charge-offs of $6.7 million and recorded $1.6 million of loan recoveries from previously charged-off loans. Net charge-offs for 2017 were $5.1 million, an increase of $569,000 as compared to 2016 net charge-offs. Management believes the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017 is sufficient to provide for probable losses inherent within the loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was 0.88% of the total loan portfolio and 148.76% of total non-performing loans. This compares to an allowance of 0.87% of total loans and 125.64% of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. The increase in the ratio from December 31, 2016 primarily reflects the increase in the covered loan portfolio due to the movement of loans from the acquired portfolio to the covered portfolio, including a reserve established for purchased loans which have demonstrated deterioration since acquisition. The portfolio purchases have no corresponding carryover of the allowance for loan losses.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllocation of Allowance for Loan Losses: The following table sets forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan category, the percent of allowance in each category to total allowance, and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated.

economic conditions, unidentified losses and other factors that may be inherent in the loan portfolio.\nSources of Funds\nThe primary source of the Company's cash flows, for use in lending and meeting its general operational needs, is deposits. Additional sources of funds are from FHLBB advances, reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds lines, loan and mortgage-backed securities repayments, securities sales proceeds and maturities, subordinated debt and earnings. While scheduled loan and securities repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, loan and investment security prepayments and deposit inflows are influenced by prevailing interest rates and local economic conditions and are inherently uncertain.\nDeposits\nThe Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer, business and municipal customers. Deposit customers can access their accounts in a variety of ways including branch banking, ATM's, online banking, mobile banking and telephone banking. Effective advertising, direct mail, well-designed product offerings, customer service and competitive pricing policies\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nhave been successful in attracting and retaining deposits. A key strategic objective is to grow the base of checking customers by retaining existing relationships while attracting new customers.\nDeposits provide an important source of funding for the Company as well as an ongoing stream of fee revenue. The Company attempts to control the flow of funds in its deposit accounts according to its need for funds and the cost of alternative sources of funding. RPC meets weekly and ALCO meets monthly, to determine pricing and marketing initiatives. Actions of these committees influence the flow of funds primarily by the pricing of deposits, which is affected to a large extent by competitive factors in its market area and asset/liability management strategies.\nTotal deposits amounted to $5.20 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $487.0 million from December 31, 2016. Core deposits increased $454.8 million, or 15.4%, from prior year end reflecting the Company's continued strategy to increase core deposits while continuing to build core relationships. This strategy included promoting commercial deposit and cash management deposit products, and competitive term deposits and money market accounts in response to the competition within our marketplace.\nThe Company has relationships with brokered sweep deposit providers by which funds are deposited by the counterparties at the Company's request. Amounts outstanding under these agreements are reported as interest-bearing deposits and totaled $389.1 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $21.7 million from December 31, 2016.\nTime deposits included brokered certificates of deposit of $259.1 million and $215.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company utilizes out-of-market brokered time deposits as part of its overall funding program along with other sources.

Members are required to own capital stock in the FHLBB in order for the Bank to access advances and borrowings which are collateralized by certain home mortgages or securities of the U.S. Government and its agencies. The capital stock investment is restricted in that there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FHLBB.\nTotal FHLBB advances increased $980,000 to $1.05 billion at December 31, 2017, exclusive of the purchase accounting mark adjustment on the advances, compared to $1.04 billion at December 31, 2016. This increase is a result of greater utilization of FHLBB advances, combined with the growth in core deposits, which assisted the Company in funding loan portfolio growth and in meeting other liquidity needs while effectively managing interest rate risk. At December 31, 2017, $921.0 million of the Company's $1.05 billion outstanding FHLBB advances were at fixed coupons ranging from 0.99% to 3.75%, with an average cost of 1.58%. Additionally, the Company has four advances with the FHLBB totaling $125.0 million that are underlying hedge instruments; the interest is based on the three-month LIBOR and adjust quarterly. The Company also has one Flipper advance with the FHLBB totaling $25.0 million, effective March 18, 2016, that converted to a fixed rate of 1.62% and is callable at the option of the FHLBB on a quarterly basis. FHLBB borrowings represented 14.7% and 15.8% of assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nBorrowings under wholesale purchase agreements totaled $20.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The outstanding borrowings consisted of two individual agreements with remaining terms of 3 years or less and a weighted-average cost of 2.59%. Retail repurchase agreements, which have a term of one day and are backed by the purchasers' interest in certain U.S. Government or government-sponsored securities, totaled $14.6 million and $18.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSubordinated debentures totaled $80.0 million and $79.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdvances payable to the FHLBB include short-term advances with maturity dates of one year or less.

The Company maintains liquid assets at levels the Company considers adequate to meet its liquidity needs. The Company adjusts its liquidity levels to fund loan commitments, repay its borrowings, fund deposit outflows, pay escrow obligations on all items in the loan portfolio and to fund operations. The Company also adjusts liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives.\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans, the sale in the secondary market of loans held for sale, maturities and sales of investment securities and other short-term investments, periodic pay downs of mortgage-backed securities, and earnings and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions and rates offered by our competition. The Company sets the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, the Company invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements.\nA portion of the Company's liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, which are a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2017, $88.7 million of the Company's assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents compared to $90.9 million at December 31, 2016. The Company's primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the calls and maturities of investment securities, increases in deposit accounts, proceeds from residential loan sales and advances from the FHLBB.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and longer-term function of business management. If the Company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLBB, which provide an additional source of funds. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $1.05 billion in advances from the FHLBB and an additional available borrowing limit of $457.8 million based on collateral requirements of the FHLBB inclusive of the line of credit. In addition, the Company has relationships with brokered sweep deposit providers with outstanding balances of $389.1 million at December 31, 2017. Internal policies limit wholesale borrowings to 40% of total assets, or $2.85 billion, at December 31, 2017. In addition, the Company has uncommitted federal funds lines of credit with four counterparties totaling $107.5 million at December 31, 2017. No federal funds purchased were outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company has established access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's discount window through a borrower in custody agreement. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had pledged 26 commercial loans, with outstanding balances totaling $195.0 million. Based on the amount of pledged collateral, the Company had available liquidity of $141.0 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $110.7 million and unfunded commitments under construction loans, lines of credit, stand-by letters of credit and unused checking overdraft lines of credit of $993.5 million. At December 31, 2017, time deposits scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled $1.23 billion. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the Company, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of its deposits are not retained by the Company, it will have to utilize other funding sources, such as FHLBB advances in order to maintain its level of assets. Alternatively, we would reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents in order to meet funding needs. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher or there is an increased amount of competition for deposits in our market area at the time of renewal.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe main sources of liquidity at the parent company level are dividends from United Bank and proceeds received from the Company's issuance of $75.0 million of Subordinated Notes in September 2014. In 2017, the Bank paid $24.0 million to the Company in dividends. In 2016, there were no dividends from the Bank to the Company. The main uses of liquidity are payments of dividends to common stockholders, repurchases of United Financial's common stock and corporate operating expenses. There are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Bank as discussed in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 - Business\u201d found elsewhere in this report. See Note 17, Regulatory Matters\u201d for further information on dividend restrictions.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank is categorized as well-capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. See Note 17, Regulatory Matters\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for discussion of capital requirements.\nThe liquidity position of the Company is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has a detailed liquidity contingency plan which is designed to respond to liquidity concerns in a prompt and comprehensive manner.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand United Financial Bancorp, Inc., our operations and our present business environment. We believe accuracy, transparency and clarity are the primary goals of successful financial reporting. We remain committed to transparency in our financial reporting, providing our stockholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting an accurate view of our financial disclosures, financial position and operating results.\nMD&A is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes thereto contained in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The following sections are included in MD&A:\n \u2022 Our Business - a general description of our business, our objectives and the challenges and risks of our business. \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates - a discussion of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates. \n \u2022 Operating Results - an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \u2022 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - an overview of financial condition and market and interest rate risk. \nOur Business\nGeneral\nBy assets, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. is the third largest publicly traded banking institution headquartered in Connecticut with consolidated assets of $7.11 billion and stockholders' equity of $693.3 million at December 31, 2017. United's business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision-making authority. The Company delivers financial services to individuals, families, businesses and municipalities throughout Connecticut and Western and Central Massachusetts and the region through its 53 banking offices, its commercial loan and mortgage loan production offices, 64 ATMs, telephone banking, mobile banking and online banking (www.bankatunited.com).\nThe Company strives to remain a leader in meeting the financial service needs of the community and to provide superior customer service to the businesses and individuals in the market areas that it has served since 1858. United Bank is a community-oriented provider of traditional banking products and services to business organizations and individuals, offering products such as commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, residential real estate and consumer loans and a variety of deposit products. Our business philosophy is to remain a community-oriented franchise and continue to focus on providing superior customer service to meet the financial needs of the communities in which we operate. Current strategies include: (1) allocating capital to lending activities that are accretive to the Company's return on assets and return on equity; continuing to acquire and support commercial clients through lending activities and cash management and deposit services which exhibit acceptable credit adjusted spreads; and growing our deposit base through acquisition of low cost deposits; (2) increasing the non-interest income component of total revenues through development of banking-related fee income and the sale of investment products ;(3) continuing to improve operating efficiencies and maintain expense discipline; and (4) developing products and services that expand our banking network through mobile and internet channels and making opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, loans, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses from time to time.\nThe Company's results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds, consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by the Company's provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income primarily consists of fee income from depositors, gain on sale of loans, mortgage servicing income and loan sale income and increases in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d). Non-interest expense consists principally of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, service bureau fees, marketing, professional fees, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses.\nResults of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions and changes in interest rates as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations or government policies may materially affect the Company.\nOur Objectives\nThe Company seeks to grow organically and through strategic mergers/acquisitions as well as to continually deliver superior value to its customers, stockholders, employees and communities through achievement of its core operating objectives which are to:\n \u2022 Align earning asset growth with organic capital and low cost core deposit generation to maintain strong capital and liquidity; \n 39 \n \u2022 Re-mix cash flows into better yielding risk adjusted return on assets with lower funding costs relative to peers; \n \u2022 Invest in people, systems and technology to grow revenue and improve customer experience while maintaining attractive cost structure; \n \u2022 Grow operating revenue, maximize operating earnings, grow tangible book value and pay dividends. Achieve more revenue into non-interest income and core fee income.  Significant factors management reviews to evaluate achievement of the Company's operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include, but are not limited to: net income and earnings per share, return on tangible equity and assets, net interest margin, non-interest income, operating expenses related to total average assets and efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP metric), asset quality, loan and deposit growth, capital management, liquidity and interest rate sensitivity levels, customer service standards, market share and peer comparisons.\nChallenges and Risks\nAs we look forward, management has identified five key challenges and risks that are likely to present challenges for near term performance:\nNet interest income. The growth of net interest income is vital to our continued success and profitability. In 2017, our tax-equivalent net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.01%. This increase was mostly due to improvements in the yields of the commercial portfolio, driven by the variable/floating rate segments tied to Prime and LIBOR indices, as well as improvement in the yields of the home equity line of credit portfolio. In 2017, the Company continued to execute interest rate swaps, with a higher level of transactional volume as compared to the prior year. The loan swap fee income is generated as part of the Company's loan level hedge program that is offered to certain commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The LIBOR based adjustable rate loans created through the loan level hedge program effected net interest margin, but better position the Company for a rising interest rate environment. The Company's ability to decrease the cost of funding relative to 2017 is diminished due to the expectation of future short term increases and the Fed Funds rate by the Federal Open Market Committee and any improvement in the cost will be dependent on a more favorable deposit mix with more low cost demand deposit accounts.\nThe risk associated with our deposit pricing strategy is a potential outflow of deposits to competitors in search of higher rates. We will continue to focus on enhancing and developing new products in a cost effective manner and believe that will help mitigate the risk of deposit outflow. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the pricing opportunities in our lending area.\nMaintaining credit quality and rigorous risk management. The national economy continued to improve through 2017. The Company continued to maintain its strong credit quality as delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs generally outperform the average of our peer group. Our ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.59%, total delinquencies to total loans was 0.56% and our allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.88% at December 31, 2017. Net loan charge-offs remained relatively flat at $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect to be able to continue to maintain strong asset quality relative to industry levels. Risk management oversight of operations is a critical component of our enterprise risk management framework.\nCompetition in the marketplace. United faces competition within the financial services industry from some well-established national and local companies. We expect loan and deposit competition to remain vigorous. However, we are poised to take advantage of the continuing industry consolidation in our market and consumers' willingness to switch financial service providers because of their skepticism of big banks.\u201d Therefore, we must continue to recruit and retain the best talent, expand our product offerings, expand our market area, improve operating efficiencies and develop and maintain our brand to increase market share to benefit from these opportunities.\nRegulatory considerations. The banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Continued changes to the regulatory landscape is the norm. Recent changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations, including the continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III have and will continue to affect the lending, investment and operating activities of the Company. While these regulatory changes made were to ensure the long-term stability in the financial markets, Management will have to apply additional resources to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.\nIn July 2013, the three Federal bank regulatory agencies (the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) approved the final Basel III rules that amended the existing capital adequacy requirements of banks and bank holding companies for smaller banks as defined. The new rules became effective for smaller banks and bank holding companies on January 15, 2015, with full phase-in to be completed by January 1, 2019. The\n 40 \nCompany believes it will continue to exceed all expected well-capitalized regulatory requirements upon the complete phase-in of Basel III.\nIn complying with new regulations, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be impacted in a way we cannot currently predict or mitigate, but we will continue to monitor the regulatory rulings and will work to execute the most beneficial course of action for the Company's shareholders.\nManaging expansion, growth, and future acquisitions. On April 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Legacy United. The Company's primary growth will be organic but we may use acquisition to supplement organic growth. We anticipate this growth will expand our brand into new geographic markets as we implement our business model. Since December 2015, the Company has strategically purchased various types of loan portfolios to compliment organic loan growth. The outstanding principal balances of purchased loans serviced by others at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $470.4 million and $377.5 million, respectively. These loans extend beyond our geographic footprint with quality borrowers that we would not be able to originate in our market area.\nThe success of this continued expansion depends on our ability to maintain and develop an infrastructure appropriate to support and integrate such growth. Also, our success depends on the acceptance by customers of us and our services in these new markets and, in the case of expansion through acquisitions, our success depends on many factors, including the long-term recruitment and retention of key personnel and acquired customer relationships. The profitability of our expansion strategy also depends on whether the income we generate in the new markets will offset the increased expenses of operating a larger entity with increased personnel, more branch locations and additional product offerings.\nAll five of these challenges and risks - growing the net interest income, maintaining credit quality and rigorous risk management, competition in the marketplace, regulatory considerations and managing expansion, growth, and future acquisitions - have the potential to have a material adverse effect on United; however, we believe the Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks.\nSee also Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing United.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board.\nAllowance For Loan Losses\nCritical Estimates\nOur loan portfolio is segregated between originated loans which are accounted for under the amortized cost method and acquired loans which are originally recorded at fair value, resulting in no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. Loans accounted for under the amortized cost method are considered covered\u201d loans. For covered loans, we determine our allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment, which consists of owner-occupied and investor non-owner occupied commercial real estate, commercial and residential construction, commercial business, residential real estate, home equity and other consumer loans. Acquired non-impaired loans (referred to as acquired\u201d loans) are loans for which there is no evidence of deterioration subsequent to acquisition and therefore have no allowance for loan losses associated with them. Certain acquired loans carry an allowance for loan losses when there has been measured credit deterioration in the loans subsequent to acquisition such that a reserve is required. These acquired loans, for which an allowance is established, are also considered covered loans.\nCovered loans\nWe establish our allowance for loan losses through a provision for credit losses. The level of the allowance for loan losses is based on our evaluation of the credit quality of our loan portfolio. This evaluation, which includes a review of loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical net loan loss experience, and other factors that warrant recognition in determining our allowance for loan losses. We continue to monitor and modify the level of our allowance for loan losses to ensure it is adequate to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\n 41 \nOur allowance for loan losses consists of the following elements: (i) valuation allowances based on net historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar inherent risk characteristics and performance trends, adjusted, as appropriate, for qualitative risk factors specific to respective loan types; and (ii) specific valuation allowances based on probable losses on specifically identified impaired loans. The covered portfolio consists of organic performing loans, refinanced acquired loans which have undergone a full underwriting review as well as performing acquired loans which have evidenced measured credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition, but are not deemed impaired.\nImpaired loans\nWhen current information and events indicate that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts of principal and interest when due under the original terms of a business, construction or commercial real estate loan greater than $100,000, such loan will be classified as impaired. Additionally, all loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\") are considered impaired. The need for specific valuation allowances are determined for impaired loans and recorded as necessary. For impaired loans, we consider the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent, or we use the present value of estimated future cash flows in determining the estimates of impairment and any related allowance for loan losses for these loans. Confirmed losses are charged off immediately at the time a loan becomes impaired. We typically would obtain an appraisal through our internal loan grading process to use as the basis for the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nCommercial loan portfolio\nWe estimate the allowance for our commercial loan portfolio by applying historical loss rates to loans based on their type and loan grade. This amount is then adjusted, as necessary, for qualitative considerations to reflect changes in underwriting, market or industry conditions, or based on changes in trends in the composition of the portfolio, including risk composition, seasoning, and underlying collateral. Our loan grading system is described in Note 7, Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d found in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nConsumer loan portfolio\nWe estimate the allowance for loan losses for our consumer loan portfolio based on our historical net loss experience. This amount is then adjusted, as necessary, for qualitative considerations to reflect changes in underwriting, market or industry conditions or based on changes in trends in the composition of the portfolio, including risk composition, seasoning, and underlying collateral. Qualitative considerations include, but are not limited to, the evaluation of trends in property values and unemployment.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nWe determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by analyzing and estimating losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for loan losses contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to use historical information as well as current economic data to make judgments on the adequacy of the allowance. As the allowance is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors, it may impact the portfolio in a way currently unforeseen.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAdverse changes in management's assessment of the factors used to determine the allowance for loan losses could lead to additional provisions. Actual loan losses could differ materially from management's estimates if actual losses and conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized. These factors and conditions include general economic conditions within United's market, industry trends and concentrations, real estate and other collateral values, interest rates and the financial condition of the individual borrower. While management believes that it has established adequate specific and general allowances for probable losses on loans, actual results may prove different and the differences could be significant.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities\nCritical Estimates\nThe Company maintains a securities portfolio that is classified into two major categories: available for sale and held to maturity. Securities available for sale are recorded at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. Held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost. Management determines the classifications of a security at the time of its purchase.\nQuarterly, securities with unrealized losses are reviewed as deemed appropriate to assess whether the decline in fair value is temporary or other-than-temporary. The assessment is to determine whether the decline in value is from company-specific events, industry developments, general economic conditions, credit losses on debt or other reasons. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost or amortized cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings for equity securities and for debt securities that have an identified credit loss. Unrealized losses on debt securities beyond the identified credit loss component are reflected in other comprehensive income.\n 42 \nJudgments and Uncertainties\nSignificant judgment is involved in determining when a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. The factors considered by management include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 Percentage and length of time by which an issue is below book value; \n \u2022 Financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including their ability to meet contractual obligations in a timely manner; \n \u2022 Ratings of the security; \n \u2022 Whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions; \n \u2022 Whether the decline is due to interest rates and spreads or credit risk; \n \u2022 The value of underlying collateral; and \n \u2022 Our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in the market value, or more likely than not, will be required to sell a debt security before its anticipated recovery which may not be until maturity.  Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAdverse changes in management's assessment of the factors used to determine that a security was not other-than-temporarily impaired could lead to additional impairment charges. A decline in fair value that we determined to be temporary could become other-than-temporary and warrant an impairment charge. Additionally, a security that had no apparent risk could be affected by a sudden or acute market condition and necessitate an impairment charge.\nIncome Taxes\nCritical Estimates\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's asset and liabilities. The realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years' taxable income, to which carry back\u201d refund claims could be made. A valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. Furthermore, tax positions that could be deemed uncertain are required to be disclosed and reserved for if it is is more likely than not that the position would not be sustained upon audit examination.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Some judgments are subjective and involve estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. In determining the valuation allowance, we use historical and forecasted future operating results, based upon approved business plans, including a review of the eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. In determining the level of reserve needed for uncertain tax positions, we consider relevant current legislation and court rulings, among other authoritative items, to determine the level of exposure inherent in tax positions of the Company. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions are a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance and changes in tax legislation could result in the need for additional tax reserves.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nShould actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management, the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset and tax positions taken could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. If the Company is not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future or if a tax position is overturned by a taxing authority, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made.\nGoodwill\nCritical Estimates\nGoodwill represents the amount the Company paid as a result of acquisitions in excess of the related fair value of net assets acquired. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analysis, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate.\n 43 \nWhen goodwill is evaluated for impairment, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to income. The fair value is based on observable market prices, when practicable. Other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable, including estimated discounted cash flows and market multiples analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. In the event of future changes in fair value, the Company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill by performing an internal valuation analysis, and determined there was no impairment. Through year end, no events or circumstances subsequent to the annual testing date indicate that the carrying value of the Company's goodwill may not be recoverable, therefore, no interim testing was required.\nThe carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2017 was $115.3 million. For further discussion on goodwill see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nFair value is determined using quantitative analysis and widely accepted valuation techniques, including estimated future cash flows, comparable transactions, control premium and market peers. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nIf actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Management has evaluated the effect of lowering the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and determined no goodwill impairment was necessary under accounting guidance for goodwill impairment.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nCritical Estimates\nCurrently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payment) and the expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payment (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rates curves.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nDetermining the fair value of interest rate derivatives requires the use of the standard market methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise based upon the forward swap curve assumption and netting the cash receipt against the contractual cash payment observed at the instrument's effective date. The Company's estimates of variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The Company further incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty's non-performance risk in the fair value measurements and requirements for collateral transfer to secure the market value of the derivative instrument(s).\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAlthough the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of the current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of non-performance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. Incorrect assumptions could result in an overstatement or understatement of the value of the derivative contract.\nOperating Results\n 44 \nIncome Statement Summary\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures by major category for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand United Financial Bancorp, Inc., our operations and our present business environment. We believe accuracy, transparency and clarity are the primary goals of successful financial reporting. We remain committed to transparency in our financial reporting, providing our stockholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting an accurate view of our financial disclosures, financial position and operating results.\nMD&A is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes thereto contained in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The following sections are included in MD&A:\n \u2022 Our Business - a general description of our business, our objectives and the challenges and risks of our business. \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates - a discussion of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates. \n \u2022 Operating Results - an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \u2022 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - an overview of financial condition and market and interest rate risk. \nOur Business\nGeneral\nBy assets, United Financial Bancorp, Inc. is the third largest publicly traded banking institution headquartered in Connecticut with consolidated assets of $7.11 billion and stockholders' equity of $693.3 million at December 31, 2017. United's business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision-making authority. The Company delivers financial services to individuals, families, businesses and municipalities throughout Connecticut and Western and Central Massachusetts and the region through its 53 banking offices, its commercial loan and mortgage loan production offices, 64 ATMs, telephone banking, mobile banking and online banking (www.bankatunited.com).\nThe Company strives to remain a leader in meeting the financial service needs of the community and to provide superior customer service to the businesses and individuals in the market areas that it has served since 1858. United Bank is a community-oriented provider of traditional banking products and services to business organizations and individuals, offering products such as commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, residential real estate and consumer loans and a variety of deposit products. Our business philosophy is to remain a community-oriented franchise and continue to focus on providing superior customer service to meet the financial needs of the communities in which we operate. Current strategies include: (1) allocating capital to lending activities that are accretive to the Company's return on assets and return on equity; continuing to acquire and support commercial clients through lending activities and cash management and deposit services which exhibit acceptable credit adjusted spreads; and growing our deposit base through acquisition of low cost deposits; (2) increasing the non-interest income component of total revenues through development of banking-related fee income and the sale of investment products ;(3) continuing to improve operating efficiencies and maintain expense discipline; and (4) developing products and services that expand our banking network through mobile and internet channels and making opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, loans, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses from time to time.\nThe Company's results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds, consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by the Company's provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income primarily consists of fee income from depositors, gain on sale of loans, mortgage servicing income and loan sale income and increases in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d). Non-interest expense consists principally of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, service bureau fees, marketing, professional fees, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses.\nResults of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions and changes in interest rates as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations or government policies may materially affect the Company.\nOur Objectives\nThe Company seeks to grow organically and through strategic mergers/acquisitions as well as to continually deliver superior value to its customers, stockholders, employees and communities through achievement of its core operating objectives which are to:\n \u2022 Align earning asset growth with organic capital and low cost core deposit generation to maintain strong capital and liquidity; \n 39 \n \u2022 Re-mix cash flows into better yielding risk adjusted return on assets with lower funding costs relative to peers; \n \u2022 Invest in people, systems and technology to grow revenue and improve customer experience while maintaining attractive cost structure; \n \u2022 Grow operating revenue, maximize operating earnings, grow tangible book value and pay dividends. Achieve more revenue into non-interest income and core fee income.  Significant factors management reviews to evaluate achievement of the Company's operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include, but are not limited to: net income and earnings per share, return on tangible equity and assets, net interest margin, non-interest income, operating expenses related to total average assets and efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP metric), asset quality, loan and deposit growth, capital management, liquidity and interest rate sensitivity levels, customer service standards, market share and peer comparisons.\nChallenges and Risks\nAs we look forward, management has identified five key challenges and risks that are likely to present challenges for near term performance:\nNet interest income. The growth of net interest income is vital to our continued success and profitability. In 2017, our tax-equivalent net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.01%. This increase was mostly due to improvements in the yields of the commercial portfolio, driven by the variable/floating rate segments tied to Prime and LIBOR indices, as well as improvement in the yields of the home equity line of credit portfolio. In 2017, the Company continued to execute interest rate swaps, with a higher level of transactional volume as compared to the prior year. The loan swap fee income is generated as part of the Company's loan level hedge program that is offered to certain commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The LIBOR based adjustable rate loans created through the loan level hedge program effected net interest margin, but better position the Company for a rising interest rate environment. The Company's ability to decrease the cost of funding relative to 2017 is diminished due to the expectation of future short term increases and the Fed Funds rate by the Federal Open Market Committee and any improvement in the cost will be dependent on a more favorable deposit mix with more low cost demand deposit accounts.\nThe risk associated with our deposit pricing strategy is a potential outflow of deposits to competitors in search of higher rates. We will continue to focus on enhancing and developing new products in a cost effective manner and believe that will help mitigate the risk of deposit outflow. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the pricing opportunities in our lending area.\nMaintaining credit quality and rigorous risk management. The national economy continued to improve through 2017. The Company continued to maintain its strong credit quality as delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs generally outperform the average of our peer group. Our ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.59%, total delinquencies to total loans was 0.56% and our allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.88% at December 31, 2017. Net loan charge-offs remained relatively flat at $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect to be able to continue to maintain strong asset quality relative to industry levels. Risk management oversight of operations is a critical component of our enterprise risk management framework.\nCompetition in the marketplace. United faces competition within the financial services industry from some well-established national and local companies. We expect loan and deposit competition to remain vigorous. However, we are poised to take advantage of the continuing industry consolidation in our market and consumers' willingness to switch financial service providers because of their skepticism of big banks.\u201d Therefore, we must continue to recruit and retain the best talent, expand our product offerings, expand our market area, improve operating efficiencies and develop and maintain our brand to increase market share to benefit from these opportunities.\nRegulatory considerations. The banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Continued changes to the regulatory landscape is the norm. Recent changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations, including the continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III have and will continue to affect the lending, investment and operating activities of the Company. While these regulatory changes made were to ensure the long-term stability in the financial markets, Management will have to apply additional resources to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.\nIn July 2013, the three Federal bank regulatory agencies (the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) approved the final Basel III rules that amended the existing capital adequacy requirements of banks and bank holding companies for smaller banks as defined. The new rules became effective for smaller banks and bank holding companies on January 15, 2015, with full phase-in to be completed by January 1, 2019. The\n 40 \nCompany believes it will continue to exceed all expected well-capitalized regulatory requirements upon the complete phase-in of Basel III.\nIn complying with new regulations, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be impacted in a way we cannot currently predict or mitigate, but we will continue to monitor the regulatory rulings and will work to execute the most beneficial course of action for the Company's shareholders.\nManaging expansion, growth, and future acquisitions. On April 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Legacy United. The Company's primary growth will be organic but we may use acquisition to supplement organic growth. We anticipate this growth will expand our brand into new geographic markets as we implement our business model. Since December 2015, the Company has strategically purchased various types of loan portfolios to compliment organic loan growth. The outstanding principal balances of purchased loans serviced by others at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $470.4 million and $377.5 million, respectively. These loans extend beyond our geographic footprint with quality borrowers that we would not be able to originate in our market area.\nThe success of this continued expansion depends on our ability to maintain and develop an infrastructure appropriate to support and integrate such growth. Also, our success depends on the acceptance by customers of us and our services in these new markets and, in the case of expansion through acquisitions, our success depends on many factors, including the long-term recruitment and retention of key personnel and acquired customer relationships. The profitability of our expansion strategy also depends on whether the income we generate in the new markets will offset the increased expenses of operating a larger entity with increased personnel, more branch locations and additional product offerings.\nAll five of these challenges and risks - growing the net interest income, maintaining credit quality and rigorous risk management, competition in the marketplace, regulatory considerations and managing expansion, growth, and future acquisitions - have the potential to have a material adverse effect on United; however, we believe the Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks.\nSee also Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing United.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board.\nAllowance For Loan Losses\nCritical Estimates\nOur loan portfolio is segregated between originated loans which are accounted for under the amortized cost method and acquired loans which are originally recorded at fair value, resulting in no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. Loans accounted for under the amortized cost method are considered covered\u201d loans. For covered loans, we determine our allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment, which consists of owner-occupied and investor non-owner occupied commercial real estate, commercial and residential construction, commercial business, residential real estate, home equity and other consumer loans. Acquired non-impaired loans (referred to as acquired\u201d loans) are loans for which there is no evidence of deterioration subsequent to acquisition and therefore have no allowance for loan losses associated with them. Certain acquired loans carry an allowance for loan losses when there has been measured credit deterioration in the loans subsequent to acquisition such that a reserve is required. These acquired loans, for which an allowance is established, are also considered covered loans.\nCovered loans\nWe establish our allowance for loan losses through a provision for credit losses. The level of the allowance for loan losses is based on our evaluation of the credit quality of our loan portfolio. This evaluation, which includes a review of loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical net loan loss experience, and other factors that warrant recognition in determining our allowance for loan losses. We continue to monitor and modify the level of our allowance for loan losses to ensure it is adequate to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\n 41 \nOur allowance for loan losses consists of the following elements: (i) valuation allowances based on net historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar inherent risk characteristics and performance trends, adjusted, as appropriate, for qualitative risk factors specific to respective loan types; and (ii) specific valuation allowances based on probable losses on specifically identified impaired loans. The covered portfolio consists of organic performing loans, refinanced acquired loans which have undergone a full underwriting review as well as performing acquired loans which have evidenced measured credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition, but are not deemed impaired.\nImpaired loans\nWhen current information and events indicate that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts of principal and interest when due under the original terms of a business, construction or commercial real estate loan greater than $100,000, such loan will be classified as impaired. Additionally, all loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\") are considered impaired. The need for specific valuation allowances are determined for impaired loans and recorded as necessary. For impaired loans, we consider the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent, or we use the present value of estimated future cash flows in determining the estimates of impairment and any related allowance for loan losses for these loans. Confirmed losses are charged off immediately at the time a loan becomes impaired. We typically would obtain an appraisal through our internal loan grading process to use as the basis for the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nCommercial loan portfolio\nWe estimate the allowance for our commercial loan portfolio by applying historical loss rates to loans based on their type and loan grade. This amount is then adjusted, as necessary, for qualitative considerations to reflect changes in underwriting, market or industry conditions, or based on changes in trends in the composition of the portfolio, including risk composition, seasoning, and underlying collateral. Our loan grading system is described in Note 7, Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d found in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nConsumer loan portfolio\nWe estimate the allowance for loan losses for our consumer loan portfolio based on our historical net loss experience. This amount is then adjusted, as necessary, for qualitative considerations to reflect changes in underwriting, market or industry conditions or based on changes in trends in the composition of the portfolio, including risk composition, seasoning, and underlying collateral. Qualitative considerations include, but are not limited to, the evaluation of trends in property values and unemployment.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nWe determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by analyzing and estimating losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for loan losses contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to use historical information as well as current economic data to make judgments on the adequacy of the allowance. As the allowance is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors, it may impact the portfolio in a way currently unforeseen.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAdverse changes in management's assessment of the factors used to determine the allowance for loan losses could lead to additional provisions. Actual loan losses could differ materially from management's estimates if actual losses and conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized. These factors and conditions include general economic conditions within United's market, industry trends and concentrations, real estate and other collateral values, interest rates and the financial condition of the individual borrower. While management believes that it has established adequate specific and general allowances for probable losses on loans, actual results may prove different and the differences could be significant.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities\nCritical Estimates\nThe Company maintains a securities portfolio that is classified into two major categories: available for sale and held to maturity. Securities available for sale are recorded at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. Held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost. Management determines the classifications of a security at the time of its purchase.\nQuarterly, securities with unrealized losses are reviewed as deemed appropriate to assess whether the decline in fair value is temporary or other-than-temporary. The assessment is to determine whether the decline in value is from company-specific events, industry developments, general economic conditions, credit losses on debt or other reasons. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost or amortized cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings for equity securities and for debt securities that have an identified credit loss. Unrealized losses on debt securities beyond the identified credit loss component are reflected in other comprehensive income.\n 42 \nJudgments and Uncertainties\nSignificant judgment is involved in determining when a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. The factors considered by management include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 Percentage and length of time by which an issue is below book value; \n \u2022 Financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including their ability to meet contractual obligations in a timely manner; \n \u2022 Ratings of the security; \n \u2022 Whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions; \n \u2022 Whether the decline is due to interest rates and spreads or credit risk; \n \u2022 The value of underlying collateral; and \n \u2022 Our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in the market value, or more likely than not, will be required to sell a debt security before its anticipated recovery which may not be until maturity.  Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAdverse changes in management's assessment of the factors used to determine that a security was not other-than-temporarily impaired could lead to additional impairment charges. A decline in fair value that we determined to be temporary could become other-than-temporary and warrant an impairment charge. Additionally, a security that had no apparent risk could be affected by a sudden or acute market condition and necessitate an impairment charge.\nIncome Taxes\nCritical Estimates\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's asset and liabilities. The realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years' taxable income, to which carry back\u201d refund claims could be made. A valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. Furthermore, tax positions that could be deemed uncertain are required to be disclosed and reserved for if it is is more likely than not that the position would not be sustained upon audit examination.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Some judgments are subjective and involve estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. In determining the valuation allowance, we use historical and forecasted future operating results, based upon approved business plans, including a review of the eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. In determining the level of reserve needed for uncertain tax positions, we consider relevant current legislation and court rulings, among other authoritative items, to determine the level of exposure inherent in tax positions of the Company. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions are a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance and changes in tax legislation could result in the need for additional tax reserves.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nShould actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management, the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset and tax positions taken could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. If the Company is not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future or if a tax position is overturned by a taxing authority, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made.\nGoodwill\nCritical Estimates\nGoodwill represents the amount the Company paid as a result of acquisitions in excess of the related fair value of net assets acquired. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analysis, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate.\n 43 \nWhen goodwill is evaluated for impairment, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to income. The fair value is based on observable market prices, when practicable. Other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable, including estimated discounted cash flows and market multiples analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. In the event of future changes in fair value, the Company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill by performing an internal valuation analysis, and determined there was no impairment. Through year end, no events or circumstances subsequent to the annual testing date indicate that the carrying value of the Company's goodwill may not be recoverable, therefore, no interim testing was required.\nThe carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2017 was $115.3 million. For further discussion on goodwill see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nFair value is determined using quantitative analysis and widely accepted valuation techniques, including estimated future cash flows, comparable transactions, control premium and market peers. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nIf actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Management has evaluated the effect of lowering the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and determined no goodwill impairment was necessary under accounting guidance for goodwill impairment.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nCritical Estimates\nCurrently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payment) and the expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payment (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rates curves.\nJudgment and Uncertainties\nDetermining the fair value of interest rate derivatives requires the use of the standard market methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise based upon the forward swap curve assumption and netting the cash receipt against the contractual cash payment observed at the instrument's effective date. The Company's estimates of variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The Company further incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty's non-performance risk in the fair value measurements and requirements for collateral transfer to secure the market value of the derivative instrument(s).\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAlthough the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of the current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of non-performance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. Incorrect assumptions could result in an overstatement or understatement of the value of the derivative contract.\nOperating Results\n 44 \nIncome Statement Summary\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016-2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>9,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,041\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income\n</td> <td>33,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest expense\n</td> <td>141,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>66,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,096\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>12,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.01\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures by major category for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency Ratio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
