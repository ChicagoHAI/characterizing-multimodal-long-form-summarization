Our mission is to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule drugs in areas of high unmet need that will dramatically extend and improve the lives of our patients. These drugs target biological pathways implicated in a wide range of cancers and certain non-oncology indications. Our discovery and development efforts are guided, when possible, by an understanding of the role of biomarkers, which are indicators of a particular biological condition or process and may predict the clinical benefit of our compounds in defined patient populations. Our proprietary clinical-stage pipeline consists of four drug candidates, all of which are in targeted patient populations making ArQule a leader among companies our size in precision medicine.\nArQule has a long history of kinase drug discovery and development, having discovered and introduced eight kinase inhibitors into human clinical trials with a ninth about to enter the clinic. Our drug discovery efforts have been informed by our historical expertise in chemistry, our work in rational drug design and by our insight into kinase binding and regulation. We have applied this knowledge to produce significant chemical matter for a number of kinase targets and to build an extensive library of proprietary compounds with the potential to target multiple kinases in oncology and other therapeutic areas, such as rare diseases. We expect to bring further preclinical programs forward either directly or with collaborators and to interrogate our library against new targets beyond kinases.\nOur lead product candidate is tivantinib (ARQ 197), an orally administered, small molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase ( MET\u201d) and its biological pathway. MET is a promising target for cancer therapy, based on its multiple roles in cancerous cell proliferation, tumor spread, new blood vessel formation and resistance to certain drug therapies. We and our partners, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. ( Daiichi Sankyo\u201d) and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. ( Kyowa Hakko Kirin\u201d), are implementing a worldwide clinical development program with tivantinib. Our strategy is to focus on the most promising indications within our clinical programs based upon continually generated and updated clinical and pre-clinical data. Our lead indication is liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma\u201d or HCC\u201d), and we are currently conducting two Phase 3 trials with our partners. We have also completed earlier-stage single agent and combination therapy trials and pre-clinical experiments with tivantinib and other anti-cancer agents that may provide data to support trials in additional indications.\nOur most advanced ongoing clinical trial, the METIV-HCC trial, is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, controlled study of tivantinib as single agent therapy in previously treated patients with MET diagnostic-high, inoperable HCC conducted by Daiichi Sankyo and us. The primary endpoint is overall survival ( OS\u201d) in the intent-to-treat ( ITT\u201d) population, and the secondary endpoint is progression-free survival ( PFS\u201d) in the same population.\nWe completed patient accrual in the METIV-HCC trial in December 2015 and have randomized over 300 patients at more than 100 clinical sites worldwide. We anticipate that a planned interim assessment for the trial, which is triggered when 60 percent of events occur, will take place by early in the second quarter of 2016. This trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment ( SPA\u201d) agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d).\nIn addition to METIV-HCC, a second Phase 3 clinical trial in HCC with tivantinib known as JET-HCC is ongoing in Japan. On February 4, 2014, Kyowa Hakko Kirin announced the initiation of this trial in Japanese patients with MET diagnostic-high, inoperable HCC previously treated with sorafenib. The trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study to compare PFS in patients treated with tivantinib with those treated with placebo. Kyowa Hakko Kirin plans to enroll approximately 160 patients in this study.\nWe have licensed commercial rights to tivantinib for human cancer indications to Daiichi Sankyo in the U.S., Europe, South America and the rest of the world, excluding Japan and certain other Asian countries, where we have licensed commercial rights to Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Our agreements with these partners\nprovide for possible future milestone payments, royalties on product sales, and development funding, in addition to significant payments that we have already received. To date we have received $100 million in upfront and milestone payments from Daiichi Sankyo, $15 million of which was related to the first patient enrolled in the METIV-HCC trial. That milestone was netted against our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs in 2013, and consequently we did not receive any cash proceeds from this milestone. To date, we have received $48 million in upfront and milestone payments from Kyowa Hakko Kirin.\nWe have collaborated with the National Cancer Institute ( NCI\u201d) through its Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP\u201d) to explore the clinical potential of tivantinib in a variety of tumor indications while we focus our internal efforts on the two Phase 3 programs in HCC. These CTEP-sponsored trials included Phase 2 single agent trials in prostate cancer (randomized), multiple myeloma, breast cancer and malignant mesothelioma, and Phase 2 combination therapy trials in kidney cancer (with or without erlotinib, randomized) and head and neck cancer (with or without cetuximab, randomized).\nOur proprietary pipeline of product candidates is directed toward molecular targets and biological processes with demonstrated roles in the development of both human cancers and rare, non-oncology diseases. These product candidates include: ARQ 092, designed to inhibit the AKT serine/threonine kinase; ARQ 087, a multi-kinase inhibitor designed to preferentially inhibit the fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR\u201d) family; and ARQ 761, a Beta lapachone analog being evaluated in investigator-sponsored testing as a promoter of NQO1-mediated programmed cancer cell necrosis. We expect to add to our proprietary pipeline with the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in oncology with our next generation AKT inhibitor, ARQ 751, in the first half of 2016. Specific tumor types and biomarkers have been identified to guide our clinical testing, based on analyses of Phase 1a anti-cancer activity in humans, preclinical findings and scientific literature.\nUnder our agreement with the National Human Genome Research Institute of the NIH, a Phase 1 clinical trial investigating ARQ 092 as a potential treatment for Proteus syndrome, a rare overgrowth disorder caused by a mutation in the AKT 1 gene, began enrolling patients in November 2015. A Phase 1b clinical trial for ARQ 092 has completed enrollment in lymphoma and endometrial cancers and continues to enroll in cancers harboring AKT 1 and PI3K mutations. Thus far in this enriched cohort of the trial, we have observed five patients with confirmed responses, two of which had the same AKT 1 mutation which occurs in Proteus syndrome. Clinical development of ARQ 087 has advanced into Phase 2 for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( iCCA\u201d) following the observation of two confirmed partial responses in this patient population in the Phase 1 portion of the trial. Additional testing is on-going in solid tumors as part of a Phase 1b expansion cohort of this trial. ARQ 761 is currently in a Phase 1b clinical trial for solid tumors and Phase 1b/2 for pancreatic cancer.\nOn July 30, 2014, we approved plans to restructure our operations to better align our human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical stage development programs and to extend our cash runway beyond the anticipated time frame for achievement of key milestones, such as the completion of the METIV-HCC trial. Commencing on August 4, 2014, we began to reduce our workforce from 62 to approximately 40 employees by the end of 2014. Most of this reduction came from our Discovery Group, which had been engaged primarily in early-stage, pre-clinical research. As a result of this near-term focus on our proprietary clinical pipeline, including ARQ 092 and ARQ 087, we will concentrate our discovery efforts on the development of a number of preclinical programs derived from our insights into kinase biology and library of proprietary compounds, as well as the enhancement and preservation of such library. We plan to achieve progress in these areas through greater reliance on academic and other collaborations and on outsourcing strategies.\nWe have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately $482 million from inception through December 31, 2015. We recorded a net loss for 2013, 2014 and 2015 and expect a net loss for 2016.\nOur revenue consists primarily of development funding from our alliances with Daiichi Sankyo and Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Revenue and expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors, notably the timing and extent of our cancer-related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials.\nIn May 2015, we entered into a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with Beryllium Discovery Corp. ( Beryllium\u201d). Pursuant to the agreement, we will jointly focus on the identification and preclinical development of inhibitors of PD-1 and PDL-1. We and Beryllium will each be responsible for our respective internal and outsourcing costs during pre-clinical development. Following lead optimization of any potential drug candidates, we and Beryllium will jointly decide whether to advance compounds into GLP/toxicology and clinical testing, initially on a shared cost basis, provided that we will have the right to advance compounds on our own should Beryllium vote against such advancement. The agreement also provides that we will be responsible for clinical development and commercialization of product candidates that are not out-licensed. Beryllium will have the right to participate financially throughout the program but will also have the option to opt out at certain times and receive a royalty. The agreement will terminate after the last payment obligation is satisfied, or prior to that upon 60-days' notice by either party.\nOn December 18, 2008, we entered into a license, co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to conduct research, clinical trials and commercialization of tivantinib in human cancer indications. The agreement provides for a $60 million cash upfront licensing payment from Daiichi Sankyo to us, which we received in December 2008, and an additional $560 million in potential development and sales milestone payments offset by our share of the Phase 3 costs. Upon commercialization, we will receive tiered, double-digit royalties from Daiichi Sankyo on net sales of tivantinib commensurate with the magnitude of the transaction. On November 3, 2015, the Company announced that it had exercised its option with Daiichi Sankyo to co-commercialize tivantinib in the United States (the Co-Commercialization Option\u201d), pursuant to the Agreement. Subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, the first commercial indication for tivantinib under the Co-Commercialization Option is anticipated to be second line HCC. The parties have a prescribed period to conclude a co-commercialization agreement in accordance with the terms of the Agreement which is expected to occur in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2016. If the METIV-HCC trial is successful, and tivantinib is approved in second line HCC, the Agreement provides that the Company will receive a total of $55 million in milestone payments for the official acceptance of drug approval applications by FDA and the European Medicines Agency ( EMA\u201d) in this first indication, plus an additional $100 million in combined milestones tied to receipt of commercialization regulatory approval by the FDA and the first commercial sale in the UK, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. These milestones, totaling $155 million, will be partially offset by Phase 3 costs owed to Daiichi Sankyo by the Company which the Company expects to total approximately $75 million to $85 million at the time of approval in the US or EU. The Agreement also provides that the Company will receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales of tivantinib throughout the territory. Given the anticipated commercial market for second line HCC, the Company expects to earn royalties on net sales for this indication at the baseline contractual rate of 20 percent.\nWe and Daiichi Sankyo will share equally the costs of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies, with our share of Phase 3 costs payable solely from milestone and royalty payments by Daiichi Sankyo.\nThe dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 MARQUEE clinical trial of tivantinib in NSCLC, announced in January 2011, triggered the payment of a $25 million development milestone from Daiichi Sankyo that was received in February 2011. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model. Through September 30, 2012, revenue was recognized based upon an estimated development period through December 2013. As a result of the October 2012 decision to discontinue the MARQUEE trial, the development period as of October 1, 2012 was extended to June 2015. Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2012 and through the third quarter of 2013 revenue was recognized over that development period. In the fourth quarter of 2013, following a recommendation by the Data Monitoring Committee that the METIV-HCC trial continue with patients receiving a lower dose of tivantinib than the dose originally employed in the trial, we reviewed the estimated development period and extended it to June 2016.\nUnder the terms of our tivantinib collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo we share development costs equally with our share of Phase 3 costs funded solely from milestones and royalties. In each quarter the tivantinib collaboration costs we incur are compared with those of Daiichi Sankyo. If our costs for the quarter exceed Daiichi Sankyo's, we recognize revenue on the amounts due to us under the contingency adjusted performance model. Revenue is calculated on a pro-rata basis using the time elapsed from inception of the agreement over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement. If\nour costs for the quarter are less than those of Daiichi Sankyo, we report the amount due to Daiichi Sankyo as contra-revenue in that quarter. To the extent that our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs exceeds the amount of milestones and royalties received, that excess is netted against future milestones and royalties if and when earned and is not reported as contra-revenue.\nOur cumulative share of the Daiichi Sankyo Phase 3 costs through December 31, 2015 totaled $101.4 million. We received a milestone of\u2009 $25 million in February 2011 upon enrolling the first patient in the MARQUEE trial, the cash proceeds of which were subsequently applied to our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs. On January 31, 2013, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the pivotal Phase 3 METIV trial of tivantinib, entitling us to a $15 million milestone. That $15 million milestone was also netted against our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs in 2013, and consequently we did not receive any cash proceeds from this milestone. Our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through December 31, 2015 by $61.4 million which will be netted against future milestones and royalties, if any, when earned and has not been reported as contra-revenue.\nIn 2015, we recognized net research and development revenue of\u2009$0.1 million related to our non-Phase 3 tivantinib collaboration costs which included $0.2 million of revenue and contra-revenue of\u2009\u2009$0.1 million. In 2014, we recognized net research and development revenue of\u2009$0.2 million related to our non-Phase 3 tivantinib collaboration costs which included $0.4 million of revenue and contra-revenue of\u2009\u2009$0.2 million. In 2013, we recognized net research and development contra-revenue of\u2009$0.4 million related to our non-Phase 3 tivantinib collaboration costs which included contra-revenue of\u2009\u2009$0.7 million and $0.3 million of revenue.\nOn April 27, 2007, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin to develop and commercialize tivantinib in Japan and parts of Asia. The agreement includes $123 million in upfront and potential development milestone payments from Kyowa Hakko Kirin to ArQule, including $30 million cash upfront licensing payments that we received in 2007. In addition to the upfront and possible development milestone payments totaling $123 million, the Company will be eligible for future milestone payments based on the achievement of certain levels of net sales. To date, we have received $48 million in upfront and milestones payments.\nThe Company will recognize the payments, if any, as revenue in accordance with its revenue recognition policies. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has not recognized any revenue from these potential sales milestone payments, and there can be no assurance that it will do so in the future. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through April 2016.\nUpon commercialization, ArQule will receive tiered royalties in the mid-teen to low-twenty percent range from Kyowa Hakko Kirin on net sales of tivantinib. Kyowa Hakko Kirin will be responsible for all clinical development costs and commercialization of the compound in certain Asian countries, consisting of Japan, China (including Hong Kong), South Korea and Taiwan.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % increase (decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities short-term\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities long-term\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash flow from: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flow from operating activities.\u2002Our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees, facility and facility-related costs for our offices and laboratories, fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies, laboratory supplies and materials, and professional fees. The sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments received from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 our net use of cash of\u2009\u2009 $22.2 million, $31.8 million, and $33.7 million, respectively was primarily driven by the difference between payments for operating expenses and cash receipts from our collaborators.\nCash flow from investing activities.\u2002Our net cash provided by investing activities of\u2009$23.5 million in 2015 was comprised of net maturities of marketable securities of\u2009\u2009$23.5 million, and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of\u2009\u2009$0.3 million partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of\u2009 $0.3 million. Our net cash provided by investing activities of\u2009\u2009$30.3 million in 2014 was comprised of net maturities of marketable securities of\u2009\u2009$29.8 million and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of\u2009$0.5 million. Our net cash provided by investing activities of\u2009$34.6 million in 2013 was primarily comprised of net maturities of marketable securities. The composition and mix of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the Company's constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets, the maturity of specific investments, and our near term liquidity needs.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities typically include commercial paper, money market funds, and U.S. Treasury bill funds, which have investment grade ratings. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. ArQule's marketable securities portfolio did not include any investments in auction rate securities at December 31, 2015.\nCash flow from financing activities.\u2002Our net cash provided by financing activities of\u2009$0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of cash inflows from employee stock plan purchases.\nOur net cash used in financing activities of\u2009$1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of payment of notes payable of\u2009\u2009$1.7 million and cash inflows of\u2009 $0.1 million from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases.\nOur net cash provided by financing activities of\u2009$0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of cash inflows from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases.\nOur cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies, our ability to enter into additional corporate collaborations and the terms of such collaborations, results of research and development, unanticipated required capital expenditures, competitive and technological advances, acquisitions and other factors. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product. It is likely we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and market conditions, and due to global capital and credit market conditions or for other reasons, we may be unable to raise capital when needed, or on terms favorable to us. If necessary funds are not available, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some of our development programs, potentially delaying the time to market for any of our product candidates.\nIn July 2013, we implemented a focused reduction in our workforce of 26 positions, resulting in a remaining workforce of approximately 68 employees. This action was intended to align human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical-stage development, while retaining our core discovery capabilities. The costs associated with this action were comprised of severance payments of\u2009\u2009$422 thousand and benefits continuation costs of\u2009\u2009$89 thousand all of which were paid by December 31, 2013. We also incurred non-cash charges of\u2009\u2009$139 thousand related to the modification of employee stock options. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted in cost savings of approximately $4.0 million in 2014.\nOn July 30, 2014, we approved plans to restructure our operations to better align our human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical stage development programs and to extend our cash runway beyond the anticipated time for achievement of key milestones, such as the completion of the METIV-HCC trial. Commencing on August 4, 2014, we began to reduce our current workforce from 62 to approximately 40 employees by the end of the year. Most of this reduction came from our Discovery Group, which has been engaged primarily in early-stage, pre-clinical research. The costs associated with this action were comprised of severance payments of\u2009 $662 thousand and benefits continuation costs of\u2009 $74 thousand. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred non-cash charges of\u2009 $83 thousand related to the modification of employee stock options, and $280 thousand for impairment of property and equipment impacted by the restructuring. In the year ended December 31, 2014, $319 of these costs was paid and the remaining amount of\u2009 $417 was paid by March 31, 2015. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $3.4 million in 2015.\nOn February 26, 2016 the Company entered into definitive stock purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors for the sale of approximately 8,030,000 shares of our common stock and non-transferable options to purchase up to approximately 3,570,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $15.3 million. Each option is exercisable for $2.50 per share, and if all options were to be exercised it would result in additional proceeds of approximately $8.9 million. All options will expire on the first anniversary of a Regulatory Event,\u201d which we define as the public announcement by us of the outcome of the pre-planned interim assessment to be conducted by the data monitoring committee of the METIV-HCC trial as set forth in the Special Protocol Assessment with the United States Food and Drug Administration.\nIn light of the approximately $15.3 million to be received from the February 26, 2016 stock purchase agreements, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at December 31, 2015, financial support from our collaboration agreements, and savings from our workforce reduction described above, will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements into 2018.\nOur contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payment due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1\u22123 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3\u22125 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for a new headquarters facility. The lease commenced on May 1, 2015 for a term of five years and three months with an average annual rental rate of\u2009$455 thousand. The obligations for this new facility are included in the table above.\nPurchase obligations are comprised primarily of non-cancelable outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses, product development and other costs to support the Company's ongoing research and development efforts. Under our tivantinib collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, our share of Phase 3 costs are payable solely from future milestones and royalties, if any. As of December 31, 2015 our portion of these costs was $61.4 million and is excluded from the table above. These costs are netted against any future milestones and royalties due to us, if any. Daiichi Sankyo has the right to offset future milestone and royalty payments by this amount.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nA critical accounting policy\u201d is one which is both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management believes the following are critical accounting policies. For additional information, please see the discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development Revenue\nResearch and development revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development agreements. The terms of the agreements may include nonrefundable upfront payments, funding for research and development, milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations.\nThe Company adopted the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method on a prospective basis on January 1, 2011. The decision to use the milestone method of revenue recognition is a policy election. The milestone method may impact any new collaboration agreements or material modifications to existing agreements, in the event we elect the policy of utilizing the milestone method to recognize substantive milestones.\nResearch and development payments associated with our collaboration agreements in effect prior to January 1, 2011 are recognized as research and development revenue using the contingency adjusted performance model. Under this model, when payments are earned, revenue is immediately recognized on a pro-rata basis in the period we achieve the milestone based on the time elapsed from inception of the agreement to the time the milestone is earned over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement. Thereafter, the remaining portion of the milestone payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated development period under the agreement. This estimated development period may ultimately be shorter or longer depending upon the outcome of the development work, resulting in accelerated or deferred recognition of the development revenue. Royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned. The costs associated with satisfying research and development contracts are included in research and development expense as incurred.\nFor our tivantinib collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, we compare the collaboration costs we incur with those of Daiichi Sankyo each quarter. If our costs for the quarter exceed Daiichi Sankyo's we recognize revenue on the amounts due to us under the contingency adjusted performance model. Revenue is calculated on a pro-rata basis using the time elapsed from inception of the agreement over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement. If our costs for the quarter are less than those of Daiichi Sankyo's, we report the amount due to Daiichi Sankyo as contra-revenue in that quarter. Amounts recognized as contra-revenue are netted against our tivantinib Daiichi Sankyo research and development revenue. To the extent that our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs exceeds the amount of milestones and royalties received, that excess is netted against future milestones and royalties if and when earned and is not reported as contra-revenue.\nOn November 10, 2011, we and Daiichi Sankyo announced the execution of a license agreement for the development of a new AKT inhibitor, ARQ 092. The license agreement provided exclusive rights to Daiichi Sankyo for the development, manufacturing and marketing of ARQ 092 on a worldwide basis. Following the termination of this agreement, ARQ 092 has become our proprietary asset, and Daiichi Sankyo has no further financial or other obligations or rights related to this program. Revenue for this agreement was recognized using Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ( ASU 2009-13\u201d). Under ASU 2009-13 all undelivered items under an agreement are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether the deliverable provides stand-alone value to the licensee. The Company determined the best estimate selling price (BESP) for each unit of accounting based upon management's judgment and including factors such as discounted cash flows, estimated direct expenses and other costs and probability of successful outcome of clinical trials.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employees' requisite service period (generally the vesting\nperiod of the equity grant). We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, expected option term, expected volatility of our stock over the option's expected term, risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term, and the expected annual dividend yield. We believe that the valuation technique and approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of our stock option grants.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe generally classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. We classify our investments as either current or long-term based upon the investments' contractual maturities and our ability and intent to convert such instruments to cash within one year. We report available-for-sale investments at fair value as of each balance sheet date and include any unrealized gains and, to the extent deemed temporary, unrealized losses in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nWe conduct quarterly reviews to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio and to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. In the event that the cost basis of a security exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis, the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, and operational and financing cash flow factors, overall market conditions and trends, our intent to sell the investment and if it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the investment before its anticipated recovery. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss.\nFor available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, we perform an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security's decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss as an impairment loss.\nRegardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following are the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nRevenue\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % increase (decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 as compared to 2014: Research and development revenue in 2015 and 2014 includes revenue from the Daiichi Sankyo tivantinib development agreement and the Kyowa Hakko Kirin exclusive license agreement. The slight revenue decrease in 2015 was from our Daiichi Sankyo tivantinib program.\n2014 as compared to 2013: Research and development revenue in 2014 and 2013 includes revenue from the Daiichi Sankyo tivantinib development agreement and the Kyowa Hakko Kirin exclusive license agreement. During 2013 we also recognized revenue from the license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for the development of ARQ 092 and from a one-time research project. The $4.6 million revenue decrease in 2014\nwas primarily due to revenue decreases of\u2009$2.2 million from our Daiichi Sankyo tivantinib program due to a change in the estimated development period in Q4 2013, $1.2 million from our Daiichi Sankyo ARQ 092 agreement that ended in June 2013 and $1.7 million of other revenue from a one-time research project that was completed in 2013. These decreases were partially offset by lower contra-revenue of\u2009$0.5 million.\nUnder the terms of our tivantinib collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo we share development costs equally with our share of Phase 3 costs funded solely from milestones and royalties, if any. In each quarter the tivantinib collaboration costs that we incur are compared with those of Daiichi Sankyo. If our costs for the quarter exceed Daiichi Sankyo's, we recognize revenue on the amounts due to us under the contingency adjusted performance model. Revenue is calculated on a pro-rata basis using the time elapsed from inception of the agreement over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement. If our costs for the quarter are less than those of Daiichi Sankyo's, we report the amount due to Daiichi Sankyo as contra-revenue in that quarter. To the extent that our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs exceeds the amount of milestones and royalties received, that excess is netted against future milestones and royalties if and when earned and is not reported as contra-revenue.\nRevenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model. Through September 30, 2012, revenue was recognized based upon an estimated development period through December 2013. As a result of the October 2012 decision to discontinue the MARQUEE trial, the development period as of October 1, 2012 was extended to June 2015. Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2012 and through the third quarter of 2013 revenue was recognized over that development period.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, following a recommendation by the Data Monitoring Committee that the METIV-HCC trial continue with patients receiving a lower dose of tivantinib than the dose originally employed in the trial, we reviewed the estimated development period and extended it to June 2016. Under the previously estimated development period revenue for this agreement revenue was expected to be approximately $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, excluding contra-revenue. Under the revised development period revenue for this agreement revenue was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 excluding contra-revenue, resulting in a reduction of\u2009$0.8 million.\nOur cumulative share of the Daiichi Sankyo Phase 3 costs through December 31, 2015 totaled $101.4 million. We received a milestone of\u2009$25 million in February 2011 upon enrolling the first patient in the MARQUEE trial, the cash proceeds of which were subsequently applied to our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs. On January 31, 2013, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the pivotal Phase 3 METIV trial of tivantinib, entitling us to a $15 million milestone. That $15 million milestone was also netted against our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs in 2013, and consequently we did not receive any cash proceeds from this milestone. Our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through December 31, 2015 by $61.4 million which will be netted against future milestones and royalties, if any, when earned and has not been reported as contra-revenue.\nResearch and development\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % increase (decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 as compared to 2014: The $6.7 million decrease in research and development expense in 2015 was primarily due to lower labor related costs of\u2009$2.4 million from reduced headcount, decreased outsourced clinical and product development costs of\u2009 $1.7 million, facility costs of\u2009 $1.9 million and lab expenses of\u2009$0.7 million. At December 31, 2015, we had 21 employees dedicated to our research and development program, down from 23 employees at December 31, 2014.\n2014 as compared to 2013: The $5.3 million decrease in research and development expense in 2014 was primarily due to lower labor related costs of\u2009$4.2 million from our July 2013 and August 2014 restructurings and reduced lab expenses of\u2009$1.0 million. Other cost reductions in 2014 of\u2009$0.9 million were partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in outsourced clinical and product development costs. At December 31, 2014, we had 23 employees dedicated to our research and development program, down from 43 employees at December 31, 2013.\nOverview\nOur research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, costs of contract manufacturing services, costs of facilities and equipment, fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials, fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with pre-clinical animal studies, costs of materials used in research and development, consulting, license, and sponsored research fees paid to third parties and depreciation of associated laboratory equipment. We expect that our research and development expense will remain significant as we continue to develop our portfolio of oncology and rare disease programs.\nWe have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel-related costs on a program-by-program basis. Our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects, and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors. As a result, we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our programs on a program-by-program basis.\nThe expenses incurred by us to third parties for pre-clinical and clinical trials in the current year and since inception of our lead clinical stage program were as follows (in millions):\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> Oncology program\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Current status\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Program-to-date\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Met program-Tivantinib\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Phase 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms of our tivantinib collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo we share development costs equally with our share of Phase 3 costs funded solely from milestones and royalties. Our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through December 31, 2015 by $61.4 million and is not reflected in the above table.\nOur future research and development expenses in support of our current and future oncology programs will be subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. We test potential products in numerous pre-clinical studies for safety, toxicology, and efficacy. We may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product. As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of a product. It is not unusual for the pre-clinical and clinical development of each of these types of products to take nine years or more, and for total development costs to exceed $500 million for each product.\nWe estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> Clinical Phase\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Estimated Completion Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1\u22122 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2\u22123 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Phase 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2\u22124 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical sites included in the trials;\n\u2022\nthe length of time required to enroll suitable patients;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials;\n\u2022\nthe duration of patient follow-up to ensure the absence of long-term product-related adverse events; and\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety profile of the product.\nAn element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad pipeline of products. This is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. As a result, we believe our future capital requirements and future financial success do not substantially depend on any one product. To the extent we are unable to build and maintain a broad pipeline of products, our dependence on the success of one or a few products increases.\nOur strategy includes entering into alliance arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products, such as our collaboration agreements with Daiichi Sankyo and Kyowa Hakko Kirin. In the event that third parties have control over the clinical trial process for a product, the estimated completion date would be under control of that third party rather than under our control. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether our products will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements.\nAs a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we make significant estimates in determining the duration and completion costs of our oncology programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete our oncology programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into appropriate collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. These uncertainties could force us to seek additional, external sources of financing from time-to-time in order to continue with our product development strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business.\nGeneral and administrative\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % increase (decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 compared to 2014: General and administrative expense in 2015 decreased primarily due to lower labor related costs from reduced headcount of\u2009 $0.7 million and lower facility costs of\u2009 $1.5 million. General and administrative headcount was 15 at December 31, 2015 down from 17 at December 31, 2014.\n2014 compared to 2013: General and administrative expense in 2014 decreased primarily due to lower labor related costs from our July 2013 and August 2014 restructurings. General and administrative headcount was 17 at December 31, 2014 and 21 at December 31, 2013.\nRestructuring and other costs\nOn July 30, 2014, we approved plans to restructure our operations to better align our human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical stage development programs and to extend our cash runway beyond the anticipated time for achievement of key milestones, such as the completion of the METIV-HCC trial. Commencing on August 4, 2014, we began to reduce our workforce from 62 to approximately 40 employees by the end of the year. Most of this reduction came from our Discovery Group, which has been engaged primarily in early-stage, pre-clinical research. The costs associated with this action were comprised of severance payments of\u2009\u2009$662 thousand and benefits continuation costs of\u2009 $74 thousand. In the year ended December 31, 2014, $319 thousand of these costs was paid and the remaining amount of\u2009$417 thousand was paid by March 31, 2015. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred non-cash charges of\u2009\u2009$83 thousand related to the modification of employee stock options, and $280 thousand for impairment of property and equipment impacted by the restructuring. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $3.4 million in 2015.\nIn July 2013, we implemented a focused reduction in our workforce of 26 positions, resulting in a remaining workforce of approximately 68 employees. This action was intended to align human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical-stage development, while retaining our core discovery capabilities. The costs associated with this action were comprised of severance payments of\u2009\u2009$422 thousand\nand benefits continuation costs of\u2009\u2009$89 thousand all of which were paid by December 31, 2013. We also incurred non-cash charges of\u2009\u2009$139 thousand related to the modification of employee stock options. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted in cost savings of approximately $4.0 million in 2014.\nInterest income, interest expense and other income\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % increase (decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(57)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,026% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income is comprised of interest income derived from our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest income decreased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to a decrease in our investment portfolio. Interest expense was incurred in 2014 and 2013 on our notes payable. Other income in 2015 includes a gain of\u2009\u2009$277 thousand from the sale of property and equipment. Other income in 2014 includes a gain of\u2009\u2009$254 thousand upon the redemption of\u2009\u2009$2.1 million of auction rate securities at face value, and a gain of\u2009\u2009$388 thousand from the sale of property and equipment. Other income in 2013 includes a gain of\u2009\u2009$57 thousand from the increase in fair value of our auction rate securities.\nProvision for income taxes\nThere was no current or deferred tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013 due to our loss before income taxes and our valuation allowance. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon the weight of available evidence, as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( ATR Act\u201d) was enacted on January 2, 2013 which, among other things, provided a retroactive two-year extension of the U.S. research and development tax credits that had previously expired on December 31, 2011. We recorded the benefit from these credits in the first quarter of calendar year 2013 as a result of the enactment of the ATR Act. We recorded a benefit related to 2012 Research Credit of approximately $1,231,000 and a full valuation allowance, resulting in a net benefit of zero.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements included in this report.", "summary": "The report provides detailed insights into ArQule's business, financial condition, and operations.

financial statements and related notes contained in this report.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of innovative therapeutics to treat cancers and rare diseases. Our mission is to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule drugs in areas of high unmet need that will dramatically extend and improve the lives of our patients. These drugs target biological pathways implicated in a wide range of cancers and certain non-oncology indications. Our discovery and development efforts are guided, when possible, by an understanding of the role of biomarkers, which are indicators of a particular biological condition or process and may predict the clinical benefit of our compounds in defined patient populations. Our proprietary clinical-stage pipeline consists of four drug candidates, all of which are in targeted patient populations making ArQule a leader among companies our size in precision medicine.\nArQule has a long history of kinase drug discovery and development, having discovered and introduced eight kinase inhibitors into human clinical trials with a ninth about to enter the clinic. Our drug discovery efforts have been informed by our historical expertise in chemistry, our work in rational drug design and by our insight into kinase binding and regulation. We have applied this knowledge to produce significant chemical matter for a number of kinase targets and to build an extensive library of proprietary compounds with the potential to target multiple kinases in oncology and other therapeutic areas, such as rare diseases. We expect to bring further preclinical programs forward either directly or with collaborators and to interrogate our library against new targets beyond kinases.\nOur lead product candidate is tivantinib (ARQ 197), an orally administered, small molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase ( MET\u201d) and its biological pathway. MET is a promising target for cancer therapy, based on its multiple roles in cancerous cell proliferation, tumor spread, new blood vessel formation and resistance to certain drug therapies. We and our partners, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. ( Daiichi Sankyo\u201d) and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. ( Kyowa Hakko Kirin\u201d), are implementing a worldwide clinical development program with tivantinib. Our strategy is to focus on the most promising indications within our clinical programs based upon continually generated and updated clinical and pre-clinical data. Our lead indication is liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma\u201d or HCC\u201d), and we are currently conducting two Phase 3 trials with our partners. We have also completed earlier-stage single agent and combination therapy trials and pre-clinical experiments with tivantinib and other anti-cancer agents that may provide data to support trials in additional indications.\nOur most advanced ongoing clinical trial, the METIV-HCC trial, is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, controlled study of tivantinib as single agent therapy in previously treated patients with MET diagnostic-high, inoperable HCC conducted by Daiichi Sankyo and us. The primary endpoint is overall survival ( OS\u201d) in the intent-to-treat ( ITT\u201d) population, and the secondary endpoint is progression-free survival ( PFS\u201d) in the same population.\nWe completed patient accrual in the METIV-HCC trial in December 2015 and have randomized over 300 patients at more than 100 clinical sites worldwide. We anticipate that a planned interim assessment for the trial, which is triggered when 60 percent of events occur, will take place by early in the second quarter of 2016. This trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment ( SPA\u201d) agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d).\nIn addition to METIV-HCC, a second Phase 3 clinical trial in HCC with tivantinib known as JET-HCC is ongoing in Japan. On February 4, 2014, Kyowa Hakko Kirin announced the initiation of this trial in Japanese patients with MET diagnostic-high, inoperable HCC previously treated with sorafenib. The trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study to compare PFS in patients treated with tivantinib with those treated with placebo. Kyowa Hakko Kirin plans to enroll approximately 160 patients in this study.\nWe have licensed commercial rights to tivantinib for human cancer indications to Daiichi Sankyo in the U.S., Europe, South America and the rest of the world, excluding Japan and certain other Asian countries, where we have licensed commercial rights to Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Our agreements with these partners\nprovide for possible future milestone payments, royalties on product sales, and development funding, in addition to significant payments that we have already received. To date we have received $100 million in upfront and milestone payments from Daiichi Sankyo, $15 million of which was related to the first patient enrolled in the METIV-HCC trial. That milestone was netted against our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs in 2013, and consequently we did not receive any cash proceeds from this milestone. To date, we have received $48 million in upfront and milestone payments from Kyowa Hakko Kirin.\nWe have collaborated with the National Cancer Institute ( NCI\u201d) through its Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP\u201d) to explore the clinical potential of tivantinib in a variety of tumor indications while we focus our internal efforts on the two Phase 3 programs in HCC. These CTEP-sponsored trials included Phase 2 single agent trials in prostate cancer (randomized), multiple myeloma, breast cancer and malignant mesothelioma, and Phase 2 combination therapy trials in kidney cancer (with or without erlotinib, randomized) and head and neck cancer (with or without cetuximab, randomized).\nOur proprietary pipeline of product candidates is directed toward molecular targets and biological processes with demonstrated roles in the development of both human cancers and rare, non-oncology diseases. These product candidates include: ARQ 092, designed to inhibit the AKT serine/threonine kinase; ARQ 087, a multi-kinase inhibitor designed to preferentially inhibit the fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR\u201d) family; and ARQ 761, a Beta lapachone analog being evaluated in investigator-sponsored testing as a promoter of NQO1-mediated programmed cancer cell necrosis. We expect to add to our proprietary pipeline with the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in oncology with our next generation AKT inhibitor, ARQ 751, in the first half of 2016. Specific tumor types and biomarkers have been identified to guide our clinical testing, based on analyses of Phase 1a anti-cancer activity in humans, preclinical findings and scientific literature.\nUnder our agreement with the National Human Genome Research Institute of the NIH, a Phase 1 clinical trial investigating ARQ 092 as a potential treatment for Proteus syndrome, a rare overgrowth disorder caused by a mutation in the AKT 1 gene, began enrolling patients in November 2015. A Phase 1b clinical trial for ARQ 092 has completed enrollment in lymphoma and endometrial cancers and continues to enroll in cancers harboring AKT 1 and PI3K mutations. Thus far in this enriched cohort of the trial, we have observed five patients with confirmed responses, two of which had the same AKT 1 mutation which occurs in Proteus syndrome. Clinical development of ARQ 087 has advanced into Phase 2 for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( iCCA\u201d) following the observation of two confirmed partial responses in this patient population in the Phase 1 portion of the trial. Additional testing is on-going in solid tumors as part of a Phase 1b expansion cohort of this trial. ARQ 761 is currently in a Phase 1b clinical trial for solid tumors and Phase 1b/2 for pancreatic cancer.\nOn July 30, 2014, we approved plans to restructure our operations to better align our human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical stage development programs and to extend our cash runway beyond the anticipated time frame for achievement of key milestones, such as the completion of the METIV-HCC trial. Commencing on August 4, 2014, we began to reduce our workforce from 62 to approximately 40 employees by the end of 2014. Most of this reduction came from our Discovery Group, which had been engaged primarily in early-stage, pre-clinical research. As a result of this near-term focus on our proprietary clinical pipeline, including ARQ 092 and ARQ 087, we will concentrate our discovery efforts on the development of a number of preclinical programs derived from our insights into kinase biology and library of proprietary compounds, as well as the enhancement and preservation of such library. We plan to achieve progress in these areas through greater reliance on academic and other collaborations and on outsourcing strategies.\nWe have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately $482 million from inception through December 31, 2015. We recorded a net loss for 2013, 2014 and 2015 and expect a net loss for 2016.\nOur revenue consists primarily of development funding from our alliances with Daiichi Sankyo and Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Revenue and expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors, notably the timing and extent of our cancer-related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials.\nIn May 2015, we entered into a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with Beryllium Discovery Corp. ( Beryllium\u201d). Pursuant to the agreement, we will jointly focus on the identification and preclinical development of inhibitors of PD-1 and PDL-1. We and Beryllium will each be responsible for our respective internal and outsourcing costs during pre-clinical development. Following lead optimization of any potential drug candidates, we and Beryllium will jointly decide whether to advance compounds into GLP/toxicology and clinical testing, initially on a shared cost basis, provided that we will have the right to advance compounds on our own should Beryllium vote against such advancement. The agreement also provides that we will be responsible for clinical development and commercialization of product candidates that are not out-licensed. Beryllium will have the right to participate financially throughout the program but will also have the option to opt out at certain times and receive a royalty. The agreement will terminate after the last payment obligation is satisfied, or prior to that upon 60-days' notice by either party.\nOn December 18, 2008, we entered into a license, co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to conduct research, clinical trials and commercialization of tivantinib in human cancer indications. The agreement provides for a $60 million cash upfront licensing payment from Daiichi Sankyo to us, which we received in December 2008, and an additional $560 million in potential development and sales milestone payments offset by our share of the Phase 3 costs. Upon commercialization, we will receive tiered, double-digit royalties from Daiichi Sankyo on net sales of tivantinib commensurate with the magnitude of the transaction. On November 3, 2015, the Company announced that it had exercised its option with Daiichi Sankyo to co-commercialize tivantinib in the United States (the Co-Commercialization Option\u201d), pursuant to the Agreement. Subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, the first commercial indication for tivantinib under the Co-Commercialization Option is anticipated to be second line HCC. The parties have a prescribed period to conclude a co-commercialization agreement in accordance with the terms of the Agreement which is expected to occur in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2016. If the METIV-HCC trial is successful, and tivantinib is approved in second line HCC, the Agreement provides that the Company will receive a total of $55 million in milestone payments for the official acceptance of drug approval applications by FDA and the European Medicines Agency ( EMA\u201d) in this first indication, plus an additional $100 million in combined milestones tied to receipt of commercialization regulatory approval by the FDA and the first commercial sale in the UK, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. These milestones, totaling $155 million, will be partially offset by Phase 3 costs owed to Daiichi Sankyo by the Company which the Company expects to total approximately $75 million to $85 million at the time of approval in the US or EU. The Agreement also provides that the Company will receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales of tivantinib throughout the territory. Given the anticipated commercial market for second line HCC, the Company expects to earn royalties on net sales for this indication at the baseline contractual rate of 20 percent.\nWe and Daiichi Sankyo will share equally the costs of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies, with our share of Phase 3 costs payable solely from milestone and royalty payments by Daiichi Sankyo.\nThe dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 MARQUEE clinical trial of tivantinib in NSCLC, announced in January 2011, triggered the payment of a $25 million development milestone from Daiichi Sankyo that was received in February 2011. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model. Through September 30, 2012, revenue was recognized based upon an estimated development period through December 2013. As a result of the October 2012 decision to discontinue the MARQUEE trial, the development period as of October 1, 2012 was extended to June 2015. Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2012 and through the third quarter of 2013 revenue was recognized over that development period. In the fourth quarter of 2013, following a recommendation by the Data Monitoring Committee that the METIV-HCC trial continue with patients receiving a lower dose of tivantinib than the dose originally employed in the trial, we reviewed the estimated development period and extended it to June 2016.\nUnder the terms of our tivantinib collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo we share development costs equally with our share of Phase 3 costs funded solely from milestones and royalties. In each quarter the tivantinib collaboration costs we incur are compared with those of Daiichi Sankyo. If our costs for the quarter exceed Daiichi Sankyo's, we recognize revenue on the amounts due to us under the contingency adjusted performance model. Revenue is calculated on a pro-rata basis using the time elapsed from inception of the agreement over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement. If\nour costs for the quarter are less than those of Daiichi Sankyo, we report the amount due to Daiichi Sankyo as contra-revenue in that quarter. To the extent that our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs exceeds the amount of milestones and royalties received, that excess is netted against future milestones and royalties if and when earned and is not reported as contra-revenue.\nOur cumulative share of the Daiichi Sankyo Phase 3 costs through December 31, 2015 totaled $101.4 million. We received a milestone of\u2009 $25 million in February 2011 upon enrolling the first patient in the MARQUEE trial, the cash proceeds of which were subsequently applied to our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs. On January 31, 2013, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the pivotal Phase 3 METIV trial of tivantinib, entitling us to a $15 million milestone. That $15 million milestone was also netted against our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs in 2013, and consequently we did not receive any cash proceeds from this milestone. Our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through December 31, 2015 by $61.4 million which will be netted against future milestones and royalties, if any, when earned and has not been reported as contra-revenue.\nIn 2015, we recognized net research and development revenue of\u2009$0.1 million related to our non-Phase 3 tivantinib collaboration costs which included $0.2 million of revenue and contra-revenue of\u2009\u2009$0.1 million. In 2014, we recognized net research and development revenue of\u2009$0.2 million related to our non-Phase 3 tivantinib collaboration costs which included $0.4 million of revenue and contra-revenue of\u2009\u2009$0.2 million. In 2013, we recognized net research and development contra-revenue of\u2009$0.4 million related to our non-Phase 3 tivantinib collaboration costs which included contra-revenue of\u2009\u2009$0.7 million and $0.3 million of revenue.\nOn April 27, 2007, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin to develop and commercialize tivantinib in Japan and parts of Asia. The agreement includes $123 million in upfront and potential development milestone payments from Kyowa Hakko Kirin to ArQule, including $30 million cash upfront licensing payments that we received in 2007. In addition to the upfront and possible development milestone payments totaling $123 million, the Company will be eligible for future milestone payments based on the achievement of certain levels of net sales. To date, we have received $48 million in upfront and milestones payments.\nThe Company will recognize the payments, if any, as revenue in accordance with its revenue recognition policies. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has not recognized any revenue from these potential sales milestone payments, and there can be no assurance that it will do so in the future. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through April 2016.\nUpon commercialization, ArQule will receive tiered royalties in the mid-teen to low-twenty percent range from Kyowa Hakko Kirin on net sales of tivantinib. Kyowa Hakko Kirin will be responsible for all clinical development costs and commercialization of the compound in certain Asian countries, consisting of Japan, China (including Hong Kong), South Korea and Taiwan.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\nCash flow from operating activities.\u2002Our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees, facility and facility-related costs for our offices and laboratories, fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies, laboratory supplies and materials, and professional fees. The sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments received from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 our net use of cash of\u2009\u2009 $22.2 million, $31.8 million, and $33.7 million, respectively was primarily driven by the difference between payments for operating expenses and cash receipts from our collaborators.\nCash flow from investing activities.\u2002Our net cash provided by investing activities of\u2009$23.5 million in 2015 was comprised of net maturities of marketable securities of\u2009\u2009$23.5 million, and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of\u2009\u2009$0.3 million partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of\u2009 $0.3 million. Our net cash provided by investing activities of\u2009\u2009$30.3 million in 2014 was comprised of net maturities of marketable securities of\u2009\u2009$29.8 million and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of\u2009$0.5 million. Our net cash provided by investing activities of\u2009$34.6 million in 2013 was primarily comprised of net maturities of marketable securities. The composition and mix of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the Company's constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets, the maturity of specific investments, and our near term liquidity needs.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities typically include commercial paper, money market funds, and U.S. Treasury bill funds, which have investment grade ratings. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. ArQule's marketable securities portfolio did not include any investments in auction rate securities at December 31, 2015.\nCash flow from financing activities.\u2002Our net cash provided by financing activities of\u2009$0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of cash inflows from employee stock plan purchases.\nOur net cash used in financing activities of\u2009$1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of payment of notes payable of\u2009\u2009$1.7 million and cash inflows of\u2009 $0.1 million from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases.\nOur net cash provided by financing activities of\u2009$0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of cash inflows from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases.\nOur cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies, our ability to enter into additional corporate collaborations and the terms of such collaborations, results of research and development, unanticipated required capital expenditures, competitive and technological advances, acquisitions and other factors. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product. It is likely we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and market conditions, and due to global capital and credit market conditions or for other reasons, we may be unable to raise capital when needed, or on terms favorable to us. If necessary funds are not available, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some of our development programs, potentially delaying the time to market for any of our product candidates.\nIn July 2013, we implemented a focused reduction in our workforce of 26 positions, resulting in a remaining workforce of approximately 68 employees. This action was intended to align human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical-stage development, while retaining our core discovery capabilities. The costs associated with this action were comprised of severance payments of\u2009\u2009$422 thousand and benefits continuation costs of\u2009\u2009$89 thousand all of which were paid by December 31, 2013. We also incurred non-cash charges of\u2009\u2009$139 thousand related to the modification of employee stock options. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted in cost savings of approximately $4.0 million in 2014.\nOn July 30, 2014, we approved plans to restructure our operations to better align our human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical stage development programs and to extend our cash runway beyond the anticipated time for achievement of key milestones, such as the completion of the METIV-HCC trial. Commencing on August 4, 2014, we began to reduce our current workforce from 62 to approximately 40 employees by the end of the year. Most of this reduction came from our Discovery Group, which has been engaged primarily in early-stage, pre-clinical research. The costs associated with this action were comprised of severance payments of\u2009 $662 thousand and benefits continuation costs of\u2009 $74 thousand. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred non-cash charges of\u2009 $83 thousand related to the modification of employee stock options, and $280 thousand for impairment of property and equipment impacted by the restructuring. In the year ended December 31, 2014, $319 of these costs was paid and the remaining amount of\u2009 $417 was paid by March 31, 2015. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $3.4 million in 2015.\nOn February 26, 2016 the Company entered into definitive stock purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors for the sale of approximately 8,030,000 shares of our common stock and non-transferable options to purchase up to approximately 3,570,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $15.3 million. Each option is exercisable for $2.50 per share, and if all options were to be exercised it would result in additional proceeds of approximately $8.9 million. All options will expire on the first anniversary of a Regulatory Event,\u201d which we define as the public announcement by us of the outcome of the pre-planned interim assessment to be conducted by the data monitoring committee of the METIV-HCC trial as set forth in the Special Protocol Assessment with the United States Food and Drug Administration.\nIn light of the approximately $15.3 million to be received from the February 26, 2016 stock purchase agreements, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at December 31, 2015, financial support from our collaboration agreements, and savings from our workforce reduction described above, will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements into 2018.\nOur contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\nIn January 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for a new headquarters facility. The lease commenced on May 1, 2015 for a term of five years and three months with an average annual rental rate of\u2009$455 thousand. The obligations for this new facility are included in the table above.\nPurchase obligations are comprised primarily of non-cancelable outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses, product development and other costs to support the Company's ongoing research and development efforts. Under our tivantinib collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, our share of Phase 3 costs are payable solely from future milestones and royalties, if any. As of December 31, 2015 our portion of these costs was $61.4 million and is excluded from the table above. These costs are netted against any future milestones and royalties due to us, if any. Daiichi Sankyo has the right to offset future milestone and royalty payments by this amount.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nA critical accounting policy\u201d is one which is both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management believes the following are critical accounting", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained in this report.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of innovative therapeutics to treat cancers and rare diseases. Our mission is to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule drugs in areas of high unmet need that will dramatically extend and improve the lives of our patients. These drugs target biological pathways implicated in a wide range of cancers and certain non-oncology indications. Our discovery and development efforts are guided, when possible, by an understanding of the role of biomarkers, which are indicators of a particular biological condition or process and may predict the clinical benefit of our compounds in defined patient populations. Our proprietary clinical-stage pipeline consists of four drug candidates, all of which are in targeted patient populations making ArQule a leader among companies our size in precision medicine.\nArQule has a long history of kinase drug discovery and development, having discovered and introduced eight kinase inhibitors into human clinical trials with a ninth about to enter the clinic. Our drug discovery efforts have been informed by our historical expertise in chemistry, our work in rational drug design and by our insight into kinase binding and regulation. We have applied this knowledge to produce significant chemical matter for a number of kinase targets and to build an extensive library of proprietary compounds with the potential to target multiple kinases in oncology and other therapeutic areas, such as rare diseases. We expect to bring further preclinical programs forward either directly or with collaborators and to interrogate our library against new targets beyond kinases.\nOur lead product candidate is tivantinib (ARQ 197), an orally administered, small molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase ( MET\u201d) and its biological pathway. MET is a promising target for cancer therapy, based on its multiple roles in cancerous cell proliferation, tumor spread, new blood vessel formation and resistance to certain drug therapies. We and our partners, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. ( Daiichi Sankyo\u201d) and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. ( Kyowa Hakko Kirin\u201d), are implementing a worldwide clinical development program with tivantinib. Our strategy is to focus on the most promising indications within our clinical programs based upon continually generated and updated clinical and pre-clinical data. Our lead indication is liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma\u201d or HCC\u201d), and we are currently conducting two Phase 3 trials with our partners. We have also completed earlier-stage single agent and combination therapy trials and pre-clinical experiments with tivantinib and other anti-cancer agents that may provide data to support trials in additional indications.\nOur most advanced ongoing clinical trial, the METIV-HCC trial, is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, controlled study of tivantinib as single agent therapy in previously treated patients with MET diagnostic-high, inoperable HCC conducted by Daiichi Sankyo and us. The primary endpoint is overall survival ( OS\u201d) in the intent-to-treat ( ITT\u201d) population, and the secondary endpoint is progression-free survival ( PFS\u201d) in the same population.\nWe completed patient accrual in the METIV-HCC trial in December 2015 and have randomized over 300 patients at more than 100 clinical sites worldwide. We anticipate that a planned interim assessment for the trial, which is triggered when 60 percent of events occur, will take place by early in the second quarter of 2016. This trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment ( SPA\u201d) agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d).\nIn addition to METIV-HCC, a second Phase 3 clinical trial in HCC with tivantinib known as JET-HCC is ongoing in Japan. On February 4, 2014, Kyowa Hakko Kirin announced the initiation of this trial in Japanese patients with MET diagnostic-high, inoperable HCC previously treated with sorafenib. The trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study to compare PFS in patients treated with tivantinib with those treated with placebo. Kyowa Hakko Kirin plans to enroll approximately 160 patients in this study.\nWe have licensed commercial rights to tivantinib for human cancer indications to Daiichi Sankyo in the U.S., Europe, South America and the rest of the world, excluding Japan and certain other Asian countries, where we have licensed commercial rights to Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Our agreements with these partners\nprovide for possible future milestone payments, royalties on product sales, and development funding, in addition to significant payments that we have already received. To date we have received $100 million in upfront and milestone payments from Daiichi Sankyo, $15 million of which was related to the first patient enrolled in the METIV-HCC trial. That milestone was netted against our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs in 2013, and consequently we did not receive any cash proceeds from this milestone. To date, we have received $48 million in upfront and milestone payments from Kyowa Hakko Kirin.\nWe have collaborated with the National Cancer Institute ( NCI\u201d) through its Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP\u201d) to explore the clinical potential of tivantinib in a variety of tumor indications while we focus our internal efforts on the two Phase 3 programs in HCC. These CTEP-sponsored trials included Phase 2 single agent trials in prostate cancer (randomized), multiple myeloma, breast cancer and malignant mesothelioma, and Phase 2 combination therapy trials in kidney cancer (with or without erlotinib, randomized) and head and neck cancer (with or without cetuximab, randomized).\nOur proprietary pipeline of product candidates is directed toward molecular targets and biological processes with demonstrated roles in the development of both human cancers and rare, non-oncology diseases. These product candidates include: ARQ 092, designed to inhibit the AKT serine/threonine kinase; ARQ 087, a multi-kinase inhibitor designed to preferentially inhibit the fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR\u201d) family; and ARQ 761, a Beta lapachone analog being evaluated in investigator-sponsored testing as a promoter of NQO1-mediated programmed cancer cell necrosis. We expect to add to our proprietary pipeline with the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in oncology with our next generation AKT inhibitor, ARQ 751, in the first half of 2016. Specific tumor types and biomarkers have been identified to guide our clinical testing, based on analyses of Phase 1a anti-cancer activity in humans, preclinical findings and scientific literature.\nUnder our agreement with the National Human Genome Research Institute of the NIH, a Phase 1 clinical trial investigating ARQ 092 as a potential treatment for Proteus syndrome, a rare overgrowth disorder caused by a mutation in the AKT 1 gene, began enrolling patients in November 2015. A Phase 1b clinical trial for ARQ 092 has completed enrollment in lymphoma and endometrial cancers and continues to enroll in cancers harboring AKT 1 and PI3K mutations. Thus far in this enriched cohort of the trial, we have observed five patients with confirmed responses, two of which had the same AKT 1 mutation which occurs in Proteus syndrome. Clinical development of ARQ 087 has advanced into Phase 2 for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( iCCA\u201d) following the observation of two confirmed partial responses in this patient population in the Phase 1 portion of the trial. Additional testing is on-going in solid tumors as part of a Phase 1b expansion cohort of this trial. ARQ 761 is currently in a Phase 1b clinical trial for solid tumors and Phase 1b/2 for pancreatic cancer.\nOn July 30, 2014, we approved plans to restructure our operations to better align our human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical stage development programs and to extend our cash runway beyond the anticipated time frame for achievement of key milestones, such as the completion of the METIV-HCC trial. Commencing on August 4, 2014, we began to reduce our workforce from 62 to approximately 40 employees by the end of 2014. Most of this reduction came from our Discovery Group, which had been engaged primarily in early-stage, pre-clinical research. As a result of this near-term focus on our proprietary clinical pipeline, including ARQ 092 and ARQ 087, we will concentrate our discovery efforts on the development of a number of preclinical programs derived from our insights into kinase biology and library of proprietary compounds, as well as the enhancement and preservation of such library. We plan to achieve progress in these areas through greater reliance on academic and other collaborations and on outsourcing strategies.\nWe have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately $482 million from inception through December 31, 2015. We recorded a net loss for 2013, 2014 and 2015 and expect a net loss for 2016.\nOur revenue consists primarily of development funding from our alliances with Daiichi Sankyo and Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Revenue and expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors, notably the timing and extent of our cancer-related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials.\nIn May 2015, we entered into a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with Beryllium Discovery Corp. ( Beryllium\u201d). Pursuant to the agreement, we will jointly focus on the identification and preclinical development of inhibitors of PD-1 and PDL-1. We and Beryllium will each be responsible for our respective internal and outsourcing costs during pre-clinical development. Following lead optimization of any potential drug candidates, we and Beryllium will jointly decide whether to advance compounds into GLP/toxicology and clinical testing, initially on a shared cost basis, provided that we will have the right to advance compounds on our own should Beryllium vote against such advancement. The agreement also provides that we will be responsible for clinical development and commercialization of product candidates that are not out-licensed. Beryllium will have the right to participate financially throughout the program but will also have the option to opt out at certain times and receive a royalty. The agreement will terminate after the last payment obligation is satisfied, or prior to that upon 60-days' notice by either party.\nOn December 18, 2008, we entered into a license, co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to conduct research, clinical trials and commercialization of tivantinib in human cancer indications. The agreement provides for a $60 million cash upfront licensing payment from Daiichi Sankyo to us, which we received in December 2008, and an additional $560 million in potential development and sales milestone payments offset by our share of the Phase 3 costs. Upon commercialization, we will receive tiered, double-digit royalties from Daiichi Sankyo on net sales of tivantinib commensurate with the magnitude of the transaction. On November 3, 2015, the Company announced that it had exercised its option with Daiichi Sankyo to co-commercialize tivantinib in the United States (the Co-Commercialization Option\u201d), pursuant to the Agreement. Subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, the first commercial indication for tivantinib under the Co-Commercialization Option is anticipated to be second line HCC. The parties have a prescribed period to conclude a co-commercialization agreement in accordance with the terms of the Agreement which is expected to occur in the late first quarter or early second quarter of 2016. If the METIV-HCC trial is successful, and tivantinib is approved in second line HCC, the Agreement provides that the Company will receive a total of $55 million in milestone payments for the official acceptance of drug approval applications by FDA and the European Medicines Agency ( EMA\u201d) in this first indication, plus an additional $100 million in combined milestones tied to receipt of commercialization regulatory approval by the FDA and the first commercial sale in the UK, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. These milestones, totaling $155 million, will be partially offset by Phase 3 costs owed to Daiichi Sankyo by the Company which the Company expects to total approximately $75 million to $85 million at the time of approval in the US or EU. The Agreement also provides that the Company will receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales of tivantinib throughout the territory. Given the anticipated commercial market for second line HCC, the Company expects to earn royalties on net sales for this indication at the baseline contractual rate of 20 percent.\nWe and Daiichi Sankyo will share equally the costs of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies, with our share of Phase 3 costs payable solely from milestone and royalty payments by Daiichi Sankyo.\nThe dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 MARQUEE clinical trial of tivantinib in NSCLC, announced in January 2011, triggered the payment of a $25 million development milestone from Daiichi Sankyo that was received in February 2011. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model. Through September 30, 2012, revenue was recognized based upon an estimated development period through December 2013. As a result of the October 2012 decision to discontinue the MARQUEE trial, the development period as of October 1, 2012 was extended to June 2015. Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2012 and through the third quarter of 2013 revenue was recognized over that development period. In the fourth quarter of 2013, following a recommendation by the Data Monitoring Committee that the METIV-HCC trial continue with patients receiving a lower dose of tivantinib than the dose originally employed in the trial, we reviewed the estimated development period and extended it to June 2016.\nUnder the terms of our tivantinib collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo we share development costs equally with our share of Phase 3 costs funded solely from milestones and royalties. In each quarter the tivantinib collaboration costs we incur are compared with those of Daiichi Sankyo. If our costs for the quarter exceed Daiichi Sankyo's, we recognize revenue on the amounts due to us under the contingency adjusted performance model. Revenue is calculated on a pro-rata basis using the time elapsed from inception of the agreement over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement. If\nour costs for the quarter are less than those of Daiichi Sankyo, we report the amount due to Daiichi Sankyo as contra-revenue in that quarter. To the extent that our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs exceeds the amount of milestones and royalties received, that excess is netted against future milestones and royalties if and when earned and is not reported as contra-revenue.\nOur cumulative share of the Daiichi Sankyo Phase 3 costs through December 31, 2015 totaled $101.4 million. We received a milestone of\u2009 $25 million in February 2011 upon enrolling the first patient in the MARQUEE trial, the cash proceeds of which were subsequently applied to our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs. On January 31, 2013, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the pivotal Phase 3 METIV trial of tivantinib, entitling us to a $15 million milestone. That $15 million milestone was also netted against our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs in 2013, and consequently we did not receive any cash proceeds from this milestone. Our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through December 31, 2015 by $61.4 million which will be netted against future milestones and royalties, if any, when earned and has not been reported as contra-revenue.\nIn 2015, we recognized net research and development revenue of\u2009$0.1 million related to our non-Phase 3 tivantinib collaboration costs which included $0.2 million of revenue and contra-revenue of\u2009\u2009$0.1 million. In 2014, we recognized net research and development revenue of\u2009$0.2 million related to our non-Phase 3 tivantinib collaboration costs which included $0.4 million of revenue and contra-revenue of\u2009\u2009$0.2 million. In 2013, we recognized net research and development contra-revenue of\u2009$0.4 million related to our non-Phase 3 tivantinib collaboration costs which included contra-revenue of\u2009\u2009$0.7 million and $0.3 million of revenue.\nOn April 27, 2007, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin to develop and commercialize tivantinib in Japan and parts of Asia. The agreement includes $123 million in upfront and potential development milestone payments from Kyowa Hakko Kirin to ArQule, including $30 million cash upfront licensing payments that we received in 2007. In addition to the upfront and possible development milestone payments totaling $123 million, the Company will be eligible for future milestone payments based on the achievement of certain levels of net sales. To date, we have received $48 million in upfront and milestones payments.\nThe Company will recognize the payments, if any, as revenue in accordance with its revenue recognition policies. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has not recognized any revenue from these potential sales milestone payments, and there can be no assurance that it will do so in the future. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through April 2016.\nUpon commercialization, ArQule will receive tiered royalties in the mid-teen to low-twenty percent range from Kyowa Hakko Kirin on net sales of tivantinib. Kyowa Hakko Kirin will be responsible for all clinical development costs and commercialization of the compound in certain Asian countries, consisting of Japan, China (including Hong Kong), South Korea and Taiwan.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % increase (decrease)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2013 to 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities short-term\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities long-term\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash flow from: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flow from operating activities.\u2002Our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees, facility and facility-related costs for our offices and laboratories, fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies, laboratory supplies and materials, and professional fees. The sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments received from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 our net use of cash of\u2009\u2009 $22.2 million, $31.8 million, and $33.7 million, respectively was primarily driven by the difference between payments for operating expenses and cash receipts from our collaborators.\nCash flow from investing activities.\u2002Our net cash provided by investing activities of\u2009$23.5 million in 2015 was comprised of net maturities of marketable securities of\u2009\u2009$23.5 million, and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of\u2009\u2009$0.3 million partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of\u2009 $0.3 million. Our net cash provided by investing activities of\u2009\u2009$30.3 million in 2014 was comprised of net maturities of marketable securities of\u2009\u2009$29.8 million and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of\u2009$0.5 million. Our net cash provided by investing activities of\u2009$34.6 million in 2013 was primarily comprised of net maturities of marketable securities. The composition and mix of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the Company's constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets, the maturity of specific investments, and our near term liquidity needs.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities typically include commercial paper, money market funds, and U.S. Treasury bill funds, which have investment grade ratings. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. ArQule's marketable securities portfolio did not include any investments in auction rate securities at December 31, 2015.\nCash flow from financing activities.\u2002Our net cash provided by financing activities of\u2009$0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of cash inflows from employee stock plan purchases.\nOur net cash used in financing activities of\u2009$1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of payment of notes payable of\u2009\u2009$1.7 million and cash inflows of\u2009 $0.1 million from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases.\nOur net cash provided by financing activities of\u2009$0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of cash inflows from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases.\nOur cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies, our ability to enter into additional corporate collaborations and the terms of such collaborations, results of research and development, unanticipated required capital expenditures, competitive and technological advances, acquisitions and other factors. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product. It is likely we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and market conditions, and due to global capital and credit market conditions or for other reasons, we may be unable to raise capital when needed, or on terms favorable to us. If necessary funds are not available, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate some of our development programs, potentially delaying the time to market for any of our product candidates.\nIn July 2013, we implemented a focused reduction in our workforce of 26 positions, resulting in a remaining workforce of approximately 68 employees. This action was intended to align human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical-stage development, while retaining our core discovery capabilities. The costs associated with this action were comprised of severance payments of\u2009\u2009$422 thousand and benefits continuation costs of\u2009\u2009$89 thousand all of which were paid by December 31, 2013. We also incurred non-cash charges of\u2009\u2009$139 thousand related to the modification of employee stock options. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted in cost savings of approximately $4.0 million in 2014.\nOn July 30, 2014, we approved plans to restructure our operations to better align our human and financial resources with our primary focus on clinical stage development programs and to extend our cash runway beyond the anticipated time for achievement of key milestones, such as the completion of the METIV-HCC trial. Commencing on August 4, 2014, we began to reduce our current workforce from 62 to approximately 40 employees by the end of the year. Most of this reduction came from our Discovery Group, which has been engaged primarily in early-stage, pre-clinical research. The costs associated with this action were comprised of severance payments of\u2009 $662 thousand and benefits continuation costs of\u2009 $74 thousand. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred non-cash charges of\u2009 $83 thousand related to the modification of employee stock options, and $280 thousand for impairment of property and equipment impacted by the restructuring. In the year ended December 31, 2014, $319 of these costs was paid and the remaining amount of\u2009 $417 was paid by March 31, 2015. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $3.4 million in 2015.\nOn February 26, 2016 the Company entered into definitive stock purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors for the sale of approximately 8,030,000 shares of our common stock and non-transferable options to purchase up to approximately 3,570,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $15.3 million. Each option is exercisable for $2.50 per share, and if all options were to be exercised it would result in additional proceeds of approximately $8.9 million. All options will expire on the first anniversary of a Regulatory Event,\u201d which we define as the public announcement by us of the outcome of the pre-planned interim assessment to be conducted by the data monitoring committee of the METIV-HCC trial as set forth in the Special Protocol Assessment with the United States Food and Drug Administration.\nIn light of the approximately $15.3 million to be received from the February 26, 2016 stock purchase agreements, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at December 31, 2015, financial support from our collaboration agreements, and savings from our workforce reduction described above, will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements into 2018.\nOur contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payment due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1\u22123 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3\u22125 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for a new headquarters facility. The lease commenced on May 1, 2015 for a term of five years and three months with an average annual rental rate of\u2009$455 thousand. The obligations for this new facility are included in the table above.\nPurchase obligations are comprised primarily of non-cancelable outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses, product development and other costs to support the Company's ongoing research and development efforts. Under our tivantinib collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, our share of Phase 3 costs are payable solely from future milestones and royalties, if any. As of December 31, 2015 our portion of these costs was $61.4 million and is excluded from the table above. These costs are netted against any future milestones and royalties due to us, if any. Daiichi Sankyo has the right to offset future milestone and royalty payments by this amount.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nA critical accounting policy\u201d is one which is both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management believes the following are critical accounting"}
