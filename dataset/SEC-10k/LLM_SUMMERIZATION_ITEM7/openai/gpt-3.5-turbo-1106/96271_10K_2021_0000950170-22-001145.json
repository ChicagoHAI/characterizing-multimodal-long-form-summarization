MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS & RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nTEC has regulated electric and gas utility operations in Florida. At December 31, 2021, Tampa Electric served approximately 810,600 customers in a 2,000-square-mile service area in West Central Florida and had electric generating plants with a winter peak generating capacity of 5,919 MW. PGS, Florida's largest gas distribution utility, served approximately 445,300 residential, commercial, industrial and electric power generating customers at December 31, 2021 in all major metropolitan areas of the state, with a total natural gas throughput of approximately 1.9 billion therms in 2021.\nTEC is a wholly owned subsidiary of TECO Energy, and TECO Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera. Therefore, TEC is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Emera. See Note 10 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding related party transactions.\n2021 PERFORMANCE\nAll amounts included in this MD&A are pre-tax, except net income and income taxes.\nIn 2021, TEC's net income was $446 million, compared with $424 million in 2020. 2021 results were impacted by higher base revenues at PGS, lower O&M, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, at Tampa Electric and higher AFUDC at Tampa Electric, partially offset by higher depreciation expense at Tampa Electric and PGS. See Operating Results below for further detail regarding 2021 results as compared to 2020. For information regarding 2020 results as compared to 2019, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of TEC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOUTLOOK\nTEC's earnings are most directly impacted by the allowed rate of return on equity and the capital structures approved by the FPSC, the prudent management of operating costs, the approved recovery of regulatory deferrals, weather and its impact on energy sales, and the timing and amount of capital expenditures.\nTampa Electric anticipates earning within its ROE range in 2022. New base rates effective January 1, 2022 will result in Tampa Electric 2022 earnings to be higher than in 2021. Tampa Electric sales volumes in 2022 are expected to be similar to 2021, which benefited from weather that was warmer than normal (a 20-year statistical degree day average). Tampa Electric expects customer growth rates in 2022 to be consistent with 2021, reflective of current expected economic growth in Florida.\nIn 2022, PGS anticipates earning within its allowed ROE range and expects rate base and earnings to be higher than in 2021. PGS expects favorable customer growth in 2022, following Florida population growth and housing demand. PGS residential and commercial sales volumes in 2022 are expected to increase at a level consistent with customer growth.\nOn August 6, 2021, Tampa Electric filed with the FPSC a joint motion for approval of a settlement agreement dated as of August 6, 2021 (the Settlement Agreement) by and among Tampa Electric and the intervenors in Tampa Electric's rate case filed with the FPSC in April 2021. The Settlement Agreement agrees to an increase in base rates annually effective with January 2022 bills, to generate a $191 million increase in revenue consisting of $123 million of traditional base rate charges and $68 million in a new charge to recover the costs of retiring assets. The Settlement Agreement further includes two subsequent year adjustments of $90 million and $21 million, effective January 2023 and January 2024, respectively. Under the agreement, the allowed equity in the capital structure will continue to be 54% from investor sources of capital. The Settlement Agreement includes an allowed regulatory ROE range of 9.0% to 11.0% with a 9.95% midpoint. The Settlement Agreement allows a 25 basis point increase in the allowed ROE range and mid-point, and $10 million of additional revenue, if the average 30-year United States Treasury Bond yield rate for any period of six\nconsecutive months is at least 50 basis points greater than the yield rate on the date the FPSC votes to approve the agreement. Under the agreement, base rates will not change from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, unless Tampa Electric's earned ROE were to fall below the bottom of the range during that time. The Settlement Agreement contains a provision whereby Tampa Electric agrees to quantify the future impact of a decrease or increase in corporate income tax rates on net operating income through a reduction or increase in base revenues within 180 days of when such tax change becomes law or its effective date. The Settlement Agreement further creates a mechanism to recover the costs of retiring coal generation units and meter assets over a period of 15 years which survives the term of that agreement. The Settlement Agreement sets new depreciation and dismantlement rates effective January 1, 2022 and contains the provisions that Tampa Electric will not have to file another depreciation study during the term of the agreement but will file a new depreciation study no more than one year, nor less than 90 days, before the filing of its next general base rate proceeding. Additionally, Tampa Electric agreed to a financial hedging moratorium for natural gas ending on December 31, 2024. On October 21, 2021, the FPSC approved the Settlement Agreement and the final order, reflecting such approval, was issued on November 10, 2021. See Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIn January 2022, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges to recover an additional $169 million, effective with April 2022 customer bills, due to an increase in fuel commodity and capacity costs. The FPSC is expected to issue its decision in March 2022.\nTampa Electric has a capital investment program that supports achieving its goal to reduce CO2 emissions to 60% of 2000 levels by 2025. Since 2000, Tampa Electric has reduced its CO2 emissions by more than 50%.\n\tIn 2022, TEC expects to invest approximately $1.4 billion, excluding AFUDC, in capital projects consistent with $1.4 billion in 2021. Capital projects support normal system reliability and growth at the utilities. AFUDC will be earned on eligible capital projects during the construction periods. Tampa Electric investments include continuation of the modernization of the Big Bend Power Station, solar investments, grid modernization and storm hardening investments. PGS expects to make investments to expand its system and support customer growth, including expected investments related to compressed natural gas fueling stations, renewable natural gas, technology improvements and continued replacement of obsolete plastic, cast iron and bare steel pipe. See Capital Investments below for further information.\nThese forecasts are based on our current assumptions described in the operating company discussion, which are subject to risks and uncertainties (see the Risk Factors section).\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material financial impact on TEC's earnings in 2021. TEC's top priority continues to be the health and safety of its customers and employees. Management continues to monitor developments, economic conditions and recommendations by local and national public health authorities related to COVID-19 and is adjusting operational requirements as needed.\nTo date, customer defaults have not been material and as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, adjustments to the allowance for credit losses have not had a material impact on the financial statements. TEC is continuing to monitor customer accounts and to work with customers on payment arrangements.\nThe extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on TEC's financial results and business operations is uncertain at this time but is not expected to have a material financial impact in 2022.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nThis MD&A utilizes TEC's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our reported operating results are affected by several critical accounting estimates (see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section).\nThe following table shows the revenues and net income of the business segments on a U.S. GAAP basis (see Note 11 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements).\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tampa Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PGS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TEC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tampa Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PGS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TEC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTAMPA ELECTRIC\nElectric Operations Results\nTampa Electric's net income in 2021 was $369 million, compared with $372 million in 2020. Results primarily reflected higher depreciation expense, partly due to a $16 million intangible software amortization credit in 2020 due to a regulatory agreement approved by the FPSC, and lower base revenues, partially offset by higher AFUDC earnings and lower O&M expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses. Base revenues are energy sales excluding revenues from clauses, gross receipts taxes and franchise fees. Clauses, gross receipts taxes and franchise fees do not have a material effect on net income as these revenues substantially represent a dollar-for-dollar recovery of clause and other pass-through costs. See the Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses sections below for additional information.\nThe table below provides a summary of Tampa Electric's revenue and expenses and energy sales by customer

higher than in 2020 primarily due to higher clause revenue driven by increased fuel costs. Base revenue was $11 million lower than in 2020 due to certain revenues now being recovered through the Storm Protection Plan Cost Recovery Clause and mild weather compared to 2020, partially offset by customer growth and higher base rates from additional solar generation projects being placed in-service. Total degree days (a measure of heating and cooling demand) in Tampa Electric's service area in 2021 were 6% above normal and 5% below 2020. Total net energy for load, which is a calendar measurement of energy output, was consistent with 2020.\nCustomer and Energy Sales Growth Outlook\nThe Tampa labor market continues to outperform the state and U.S. labor markets. Due to the reopening of businesses that had closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tampa area unemployment rate decreased to 4.4% in 2021 from 7.2% in 2020. Similarly, Florida's unemployment rate decreased to 4.9% in 2021 from 7.8% in 2020 and the U.S. rate dropped to 5.4% from 8.1% in 2020. The unemployment rate in the Tampa area is expected to decline over the next few years.\nPopulation growth in the area is forecasted to continue to be a major driver of customer growth. Tampa Electric expects customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.0% annually over the next few years, assuming continued economic recovery from COVID-19 and business expansion.\nFor the past several years, weather-normalized energy consumption per customer declined due to the combined effects of voluntary conservation efforts, improvements in lighting and equipment efficiency. It is expected to continue to decline annually at an average annual rate of 0.8% over the next few years.\nIn 2022, retail energy sales are expected to be similar to 2021 levels. In 2021, energy sales benefitted from weather that was warmer than normal, while 2022 projections are based on normal weather. Normalizing 2021 for weather, 2022 energy sales are projected to increase over 2021 primarily due to customer growth and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the longer term, residential energy sales growth is expected to be around 1.2% and total energy sales growth around 0.8%.\nOperating Expenses\nIn 2021, operations and maintenance expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, was $14 million lower than in 2020 primarily reflecting lower benefits expense and lower transmission and distribution costs related to the recovery of Storm Protection Plan clause expense previously recorded in non-clause O&M, partially offset by higher insurance costs related to increased solar generation. Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, increased $30 million in 2021 from normal additions to facilities to reliably serve customers and the in-service of solar generation projects, and a $16 million intangible software amortization credit in 2020 due to a regulatory agreement approved by the FPSC.\nExcluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clause-related expense, O&M expense in 2022 is expected to remain consistent with 2021 reflecting cost control efforts. In 2022, depreciation expense is expected to increase due to solar project timings and other plant additions.\nFuel Prices and Fuel Cost Recovery\nIn 2021, the FPSC approved cost-recovery rates for fuel and purchased power, capacity, environmental, conservation and storm protection costs for 2022. The rates include the expected cost for natural gas and coal in 2022, and a net prior period under-recovery true-up of fuel, purchased power and capacity clause expense. These rates are typically set annually, based on information provided in September of the year prior to the year the rates take effect.\nIn July 2021, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges, effective with September 2021 customer bills, due to an increase in fuel commodity and capacity costs in 2021. On August 3, 2021, the FPSC approved the request to recover $83 million of additional costs during the months of September through December 2021.\nTotal fuel expense increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to higher natural gas prices. Delivered natural gas prices increased 67% in 2021 as demand from a strong economic recovery outpaced supply.\nTotal 2022 fuel and purchased power costs are expected to be greater than in 2021, due to increased prices for natural gas. In January 2022, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges to recover an additional $169 million, effective with April 2022 customer bills, due to an increase in fuel commodity and capacity costs. The FPSC is expected to issue its decision in March 2022.\nPGS\nOperating Results\nIn 2021, PGS reported net income of $77 million, compared with $52 million in 2020. Results reflect a 4.5% increase in the number of customers in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues were $95 million higher than in the prior year primarily due to higher base rates that went into effect January 2021, customer growth, higher PGA clause-related revenues, and decreased commercial sales in 2020 resulting from COVID-19. These revenue increases were partially offset by lower revenue from the cast iron bare steel replacement rider that is now being recovered through the new base rates and lower off-system sales in 2021. The base revenues increase excluding the shift of cast iron bare steel rider-related revenue was $56 million. Operations and maintenance expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, was $6 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs to operate and maintain the growing distribution system and higher insurance costs. Depreciation and amortization increased $10 million due to asset growth (see Note 3 to the TEC Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn 2021 and 2020, total throughput for PGS was approximately 1.9 billion therms and 2.1 billion therms, respectively. See Business - Peoples Gas System- Gas Operations for information regarding therms by type of customer.\nPGS provides transportation service to customers utilizing gas-fired technology in the production of electric power. In addition, PGS provides gas transportation service to large LNG facilities located in Jacksonville, Florida. PGS has also experienced interest in the usage of CNG as an alternative fuel for vehicles, especially refuse trucks and buses. Therms sold to CNG stations in 2021 and 2020 were 39 million therms and 36 million therms, respectively. Currently, there are 56 CNG fueling stations connected to the PGS system. PGS owns three CNG filling stations, and the cost of these stations is recovered over time through a special rate approved by the FPSC. CNG conversions add therm sales to the gas system without requiring significant capital investment by PGS.\nThe table below provides a summary of PGS's revenue and expenses and therm sales by customer type.\nSummary of Operating Results\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions, except customers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of gas sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Therms sold -

PGS expects customer growth in 2022 to be higher than Florida's population growth rates, reflecting expectations of continued strong housing demand in Florida. Assuming normal weather, PGS sales volumes are expected to increase consistent with customer growth.\nExcluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clause-related expenses, O&M expense in 2022 is expected to be higher than in 2021, driven by initiatives to enhance the customer experience and safely and reliably operate and maintain a growing distribution system. Due to the projected reversal of accumulated depreciation as provided for in PGS's 2020 settlement agreement (see Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), depreciation and amortization expense is expected to decrease in 2022.\nIn addition to the strong residential construction market, PGS is focusing on extending the system to serve large commercial and industrial customers that are currently relying on other energy sources. The relatively low natural gas prices and the lower emissions levels from using natural gas compared to other fuels make it attractive for these customers to convert.\nOTHER ITEMS IMPACTING NET INCOME\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net was $50 million and $36 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and included AFUDC-equity. AFUDC-equity was $45 million and $30 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in AFUDC-equity is primarily due to the timing of Tampa Electric's solar projects and the modernization of its Big Bend Power Station as discussed in the Capital Investments section below. AFUDC is expected to increase in 2022 due to the timing of construction of the Big Bend modernization, solar generation, grid modernization and PGS expansion projects.\nInterest Expense\nIn 2021, interest expense, excluding AFUDC-debt, was $151 million compared to $144 million in 2020. The increase is due to an increase in borrowings to support TEC's ongoing capital investments program.\nInterest expense is expected to increase in 2022, reflecting higher balances and interest rates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes decreased in 2021 primarily due to higher tax benefits due to AFUDC and ITC amortization related to solar projects, partially offset by higher pre-tax income and lower R&D tax credits. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 15.2% in 2021 and 16.2% in 2020. TEC expects the 2022 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nTEC is included in a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with EUSHI and its subsidiaries. TEC's income tax expense is based upon a separate return method, modified for the benefits-for-loss allocation in accordance with TECO Energy's and EUSHI's respective tax sharing agreements. The cash payments for federal income taxes and state income taxes made under those tax sharing agreements totaled $62 million and $14 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor more information on our income taxes, including a reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate, the effective tax rate and impacts of tax reform, see Note 4 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBalances as of December 31, 2021\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Credit facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Drawn amounts/LCs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Available credit facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash and short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities in 2021 were $797 million, a decrease of $32 million compared to 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the timing of fuel clause and conservation clause revenue recovery, higher accounts receivables balances due to increasing fuel prices reflected in customer bills and higher inventory balances due to plant growth, partially offset by the timing of invoice payments and new PGS customer rates going into effect in January 2021.\nCash from Investing Activities\nCash flows from investing activities in 2021 resulted in a net use of cash of $1.4 billion, which primarily reflects TEC's investment in capital. See the Capital Investments section for additional information.\nCash from Financing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities in 2021 resulted in net cash inflows of $608 million. TEC received $790 million of proceeds from long-term debt, $580 million of equity contributions from Parent and $500 million proceeds from the 1-year term credit agreement. These increases in cash flows were partially offset by dividend payments to Parent of $450 million, repayment of a 1-year term credit agreement of $300 million, repayment of long-term debt of $279 million and a decrease in short-term debt with maturities of less than 90 days of $230 million.\nCash and Liquidity Outlook\nTEC's tariff-based gross margins are the principal source of cash from operating activities. A diversified retail customer mix, primarily consisting of rate-regulated residential, commercial, and industrial customers, provides TEC with a reasonably predictable source of cash. In addition to using cash generated from operating activities, TEC uses available cash and credit facility and commercial paper borrowings to support normal operations and capital requirements. TEC may reduce short-term borrowings with cash from operations, long-term borrowings, or capital contributions from Parent. TEC expects to make significant capital expenditures in 2022 as it invests in solar projects, the modernization of the Big Bend power plant, gas distribution system expansion and other projects. See Capital Investments section below for further detail on TEC's projected capital expenditures. TEC intends to fund those capital expenditures with available cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities, cash from equity contributions and debt issuances so that Tampa Electric and PGS maintain their capital structures consistent with the regulatory arrangements. Debt raised is subject to applicable regulatory approvals. Future financial market conditions could increase TEC's interest costs which could reduce earnings and cash flows.\nAs noted earlier, cash from operating activities and short-term borrowings are used to fund capital expenditures, which may result in periodic working capital deficits. The working capital deficit as of December 31, 2021 was primarily caused by short-term borrowings and periodic fluctuations in assets and liabilities related to FPSC clauses and riders. At December 31, 2021, TEC's unused capacity under its credit facilities was $554 million.\nTEC has credit facilities and commercial paper that provide $1,300 million of credit, including $500 million maturing in 2022 and $800 million maturing in 2026. See Note 6 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the credit facilities and commercial paper. TEC expects that its liquidity will be adequate for both the near and long term, given its expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures and related financing plans.\nTEC expects cash from operations in 2022 to be higher than in 2021 primarily due to an increase in base rates effective in January 2022, higher cash inflows from fuel and cost of gas sold, and customer growth (see Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements). TEC plans to use cash in 2022 to fund capital spending and to pay dividends to its shareholder. Dividends are paid at the discretion of TEC's Board of Directors.\nTEC's credit facilities contain certain financial covenants (see Covenants in Financing Agreements section). TEC estimates that it could fully utilize the total available capacity under its facilities in 2022 and remain within the covenant restrictions.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nTEC had the following credit facilities and related borrowings as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Letters of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Letters of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Credit Facilities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commercial Paper (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>5-year facility (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>3-year accounts receivable facility (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>1-year term facility (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Borrowings outstanding are reported as notes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)This 5-year facility matures December 17, 2026.\n(3)This 3-year facility matured on March 22, 2021.\n(4)This 1-year term facility was terminated on March 23, 2021.

In addition, TEC has certain restrictive covenants in specific agreements and debt instruments. At December 31, 2021, TEC was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants. The table that follows lists the significant financial covenants and the performance relative to them at December 31, 2021.

Ratings in the BBB or Baa category are described as representing adequate capacity for payment of financial obligations. The lowest investment grade credit rating for S&P is BBB-, for Moody's is Baa3 and for Fitch is BBB-; thus, the three credit rating agencies assign TEC's senior unsecured debt investment-grade credit ratings.\nA credit rating agency rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. TEC's access to capital markets and cost of financing, including the applicability of restrictive financial covenants, are influenced by the ratings of its securities. In addition, certain of TEC's derivative instruments contain provisions that require TEC's debt to maintain investment grade credit ratings.\nSummary of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table

On February 18, 2020, Tampa Electric announced its intention to invest approximately $800 million in an additional 600 MW of new utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects by the end of 2023 (solar wave II). As of December 31, 2021, Tampa Electric has invested approximately $467 million in solar wave II. In addition, Tampa Electric intends to invest approximately $300 million in an additional 225 MW of new\nutility-scale solar photovoltaic projects in 2022 through 2024 (solar wave III). In connection with Tampa Electric's renewable energy plan, Tampa Electric expects to spend approximately $280 million for 200 MW of battery storage in 2022 through 2024. AFUDC is being earned on these projects during construction.\nTampa Electric expects to invest approximately $850 million through 2023 to modernize the Big Bend Power Station. This modernization project includes conversion of Unit 1 from coal-fired to natural gas combined-cycle technology and the early retirement of Unit 2. As of December 31, 2021, Tampa Electric has invested approximately $695 million in this modernization project. AFUDC is being earned on this project during construction. As part of the Big Bend modernization, the two combustion turbines on Unit 1 modernization were placed into service on December 1, 2021.\nTampa Electric's 2021 capital expenditures included solar generation projects, the Big Bend modernization, storm hardening for the transmission and distribution systems, smart meters and the maintenance and refurbishment of existing generating facilities. In 2022, Tampa Electric expects capital expenditures to include solar generation projects, the Big Bend modernization, storm hardening for the transmission and distribution systems, new technology for distribution system grid modernization and the maintenance and refurbishment of existing generating facilities.\nCapital expenditures in 2021 for PGS included maintenance of the existing system, expansion of the system and replacement of cast iron, bare steel and obsolete plastic pipe. In addition, PGS expects to invest in 2022 for projects associated with customer growth, system expansion to serve large commercial and industrial customers, including continued interest in CNG vehicle fleets, renewable natural gas facilities and information technology investments. The remainder of PGS's capital expenditure forecast for 2022 includes amounts related to ongoing renewal, replacement and system safety, including the replacement of cast iron, bare steel and obsolete plastic pipe, which is recovered through a rider clause (see the Business-PGS-Regulation section).\nThe forecasted capital expenditures shown above are based on current estimates and assumptions. Actual capital expenditures could vary materially from these estimates due to changes in and timing of projects and changes in costs for materials or labor (see the Risk Factors section).\nCapital Structure\nTampa Electric and PGS maintained capital structures consistent with their regulatory arrangements. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, TEC's year-end capital structure was 46% debt and 54% common equity.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that affect revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and disclosures. The policies and estimates identified below are, in the view of management, the more significant accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. See Note 1 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of TEC's significant accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nRegulatory Accounting\nTampa Electric's and PGS's retail businesses and the prices charged to customers are regulated by the FPSC. Tampa Electric's wholesale business is regulated by the FERC. As a result, Tampa Electric and PGS qualify for the application of accounting guidance for certain types of regulation. This guidance recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability. Regulatory assets and liabilities arise as a result of a difference between U.S. GAAP and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory authorities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred, as their future recovery in customer rates is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers from previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred.\nTEC regularly assesses the probability of recovery of the regulatory assets by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes, recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction, the current political climate in the state, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. The assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities will continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered.\nTEC's most significant regulatory liability relates to non-ARO costs of removal and regulatory tax liability. The non-ARO costs of removal represent estimated funds received from customers through depreciation rates to cover future non-legally required cost of\nremoval of property, plant and equipment upon retirement. TEC accrues for removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. The costs are estimated based on historical experience and future expectations, including expected timing and estimated future cash outlays. The regulatory tax liability is the offset to the adjustment to the deferred tax liability remeasured as a result of tax reform. See Note 4 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe application of regulatory accounting guidance is a critical accounting policy and estimate since a difference in these assumptions and actual results may result in a material impact on reported assets and the results of operations (see Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIncome Taxes\nTEC uses the asset and liability method in the measurement of deferred income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, TEC estimates the current tax exposure and assesses the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for financial statement and tax purposes. These differences are reported as deferred taxes measured at enacted rates in the consolidated financial statements. Management reviews all reasonably available current and historical information, including forward-looking information, to determine if it is more likely than not that some or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. If TEC determines that it is likely that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance is recorded to report the balance at the amount expected to be realized. At December 31, 2021, TEC does not have a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2021, TEC had a net deferred income tax liability of $858 million, attributable primarily to property-related items.\nSee further discussion of uncertainty in income taxes, impacts of tax reform and other tax items in Note 4 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEmployee Postretirement Benefits\nTEC is a participant in the retirement plans of TECO Energy. TECO Energy sponsors a defined benefit pension plan (pension plan), a fully-funded non-qualified, non-contributory supplemental executive retirement benefit plan available to certain members of senior management and an unfunded non-qualified, non-contributory Restoration Plan that allows certain members of senior management to receive an additional benefit to restore what is limited by the IRS under the pension plan. TEC recognizes in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of its allocated portion of TECO Energy's postretirement benefit plans. The accounting related to employee postretirement benefits is a critical accounting estimate for TEC for the following reasons: 1) a change in the estimated benefit obligation could have a material impact on reported assets, liabilities and results of operations; and 2) changes in assumptions could change the annual pension funding requirements, which could have a significant impact on TEC's annual cash requirements.\nSeveral statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans. Key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and mortality rates. TECO Energy determines these factors within certain guidelines and with the help of external consultants. TECO Energy considers market conditions, including but not limited to, changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions.\nPension plan assets (plan assets) are invested in a mix of equity and fixed-income securities. The expected return on asset assumption was based on expectations of long-term inflation, real growth in the economy, fixed income spreads and equity premiums consistent with the company's portfolio, with provision for active management and expenses paid from the trust that holds the plan assets. The expected return on assets was 6.70% as of January 1, 2021. The expected return on assets was 7.00% as of January 1, 2020. The expected return on assets was 7.35% as of January 1, 2019 and 7.00% as of October 31, 2019 when a plan remeasurement occurred as a result of a plan curtailment. Given recent strong capital market returns and market expectations for long-term interest rates, TECO Energy expects the expected return on assets to be 6.50% for 2022. Actual earned returns in 2021 were 9.0%.\nThe discount rate assumption used to measure the 2021, 2020 and 2019 benefit expense was an above-mean yield curve. The above-mean yield curve technique matches the yields from high-quality (AA-rated, non-callable) corporate bonds to the company's projected cash flows for the plans to develop a present value that is converted to a discount rate assumption, which is subject to change each year.\nHolding all other assumptions constant, a 1% decrease in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets or the discount rate assumption would have had in 2021 and is anticipated to have in 2022 the following impact on TEC's after-tax pension cost:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year\n</td> <td>1% Decrease in Assumed Expected Return on Assets\n</td> <td>1% Decrease in Assumed Discount Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2021\n</td> <td>$7 million increase\n</td> <td>$3 million increase\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2022\n</td> <td>$5 million increase\n</td> <td>$1 million increase\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses for the pension plan are being recognized over a period of approximately 11 years, which represents the expected remaining service life of the employee group. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected return and actual returns on plan assets. These unrecognized gains and losses will be systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for pensions.\nThe key assumptions used in determining the amount of obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pension (OPEB), under the applicable accounting guidance, include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs. TECO Energy determines the discount rate for the OPEB's projected benefit cash flows. In estimating the health care cost trend rate, TECO Energy considers its actual health care cost experience, future benefit structures, industry trends, and advice from our outside actuaries.\nSee the discussion of employee postretirement benefits in Note 5 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nChange in Accounting Policy\nTEC considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB. TEC was not required to and did not adopt any new ASUs in 2021.\nENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE\nEnvironmental Matters\nTEC has significant environmental considerations. Tampa Electric operates stationary sources with air emissions regulated by the Clean Air Act. Its operations are also impacted by provisions in the Clean Water Act and federal and state legislative initiatives on environmental matters. TEC, through its Tampa Electric and PGS divisions, is a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain superfund sites and, through its PGS division, for certain former manufactured gas plant sites.\nHazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS) Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS)\nOn June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded the EPA's Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS) to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for failing to properly consider the cost of compliance. The litigation is currently in abeyance while the EPA reconsiders its action. MATS remain in effect until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals acts.\nAll of Tampa Electric's conventional coal-fired units are already equipped with electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers and SCRs, and the Polk Unit 1 IGCC unit emissions are minimized in the gasification process. Therefore, Tampa Electric has minimized the impact of this rule and has demonstrated compliance on all applicable units with the most stringent Low Emitting Electric Generating Unit\u201d classification for MATS with nominal additional capital investment.\nCarbon Reductions and GHG\nTampa Electric has historically supported voluntary efforts to reduce carbon emissions and has taken significant steps to reduce overall emissions at Tampa Electric's facilities. Since 2000, Tampa Electric has reduced its system-wide emissions of CO2 by more than 50%, bringing emissions to below 1990 levels. Tampa Electric CO2 emissions continue to remain below 1990 levels. In addition to the emission decreases in 2005 as the result of the repowering of two Gannon Station coal units to natural gas and the shut-down of the remaining Gannon Station coal-fired units, Tampa Electric has optimized its existing coal units to operate on natural gas. During this same time frame, the number of retail customers and retail energy sales have risen. Tampa Electric is also substantially reducing CO2 emissions by significantly expanding the use of solar power, repowering Big Bend Unit 1 steam turbine, and retiring Big Bend\nUnit 2. By the end of 2023, the Big Bend Unit 1 modernization project, capable of producing 1,090 megawatts of power, will lead to lower system-wide emissions. See Capital Investments above for information regarding Tampa Electric's solar projects. Tampa Electric has announced a long-term goal to reduce CO2 emissions to 80% of 2000 levels by 2040 and aspires to reach a net zero future by 2050.\nOn June 19, 2019, the EPA released a final rule, named the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, to establish emission guidelines for states to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs). On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the ACE rule and remanded it to the EPA. A replacement rule is under development. Compliance with the terms of the new rule that replaces the ACE rule, once adopted and finalized, could cause an increase in costs or rates charged to customers, which could curtail sales. See Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nTampa Electric expects that the costs to comply with new environmental regulations would be eligible for recovery through the ECRC. If approved as prudent, the costs required to comply with CO2 emissions reductions would be reflected in customers' bills. If the regulation allowing cost recovery is changed and the cost of compliance is not recovered through the ECRC, Tampa Electric could seek to recover those costs through a base-rate proceeding.\nOzone\nOn December 31, 2020, the EPA published a final rule to retain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for photochemical oxidants including ozone, originally adopted in 2012. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to review the NAAQS every five years and, if appropriate, revise it. The EPA has announced that the NAAQS is currently under review, which could result in revisions to the standard affecting compliance in Tampa Electric's service territory. The impact of this potential new standard on the operations of Tampa Electric will depend on the standard that is ultimately adopted and on the outcome of any related litigation or other developments.\nWater Supply and Quality\nThe EPA's final rule under 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (effective October 2014) addresses perceived impacts to aquatic life by cooling water intakes and is applicable to Tampa Electric's Bayside and Big Bend Power Stations. Polk Power Station is not covered by this rule since it does not operate an intake on Waters of the U.S. Tampa Electric has two ongoing projects (one for Bayside and one for Big Bend) that require compliance with the rule. Compliance includes the completion of the biological, technical, and financial study elements required by the rule. These study elements have been completed and submitted for Bayside and will ultimately be used by FDEP to determine the necessity of cooling water system retrofits. Tampa Electric is negotiating an alternative schedule (as allowed by the rule) and will be completing a portion of the compliance requirements with the Big Bend modernization project with the remainder to be completed at a later date. The full impact of the new regulations on Tampa Electric will depend on the outcome of subsequent legal proceedings challenging the rule, the results of the study elements performed as part of the rules' implementation, and the actual requirements established by FDEP.\nThe final EPA rule for existing steam electric effluent limit guidelines (ELGs) became effective January 4, 2016 and establishes limits for wastewater discharges from flue gas desulfurization (FGD) processes, fly ash and bottom ash transport water, leachate from ponds and landfills containing coal combustion residuals, gasification processes, and flue gas mercury controls. The new guidelines are expected to be incorporated into National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit renewals for Big Bend Station (FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water) and Polk Power Station (gasification wastewater) to achieve compliance as soon as possible after November 1, 2018, but no later than December 31, 2023. The EPA decided to extend the near-term deadlines for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water to as soon as possible after November 1, 2020. On November 22, 2019, the EPA published in the Federal Register its proposed updates to the ELGs, in which the EPA revised limits for both bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater and extended the final compliance deadline by two years for FGD wastewater. The final rule with revised limits was published on October 13, 2020 and became effective December 14, 2020. Although a legal challenge to this rule is pending in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, no stays are in effect. However, the EPA has announced that this rule is currently under review, and a revised rule is expected to be proposed in 2022.\nThe preliminary draft of the NPDES Permit for Big Bend stated that effluent limitations for total recoverable arsenic, mercury, and selenium and total nitrate/nitrite for FGD wastewater are applicable no later than December 31, 2023. Since Polk Power Station disposes of any gasification wastewater created down the deep injection well rather than discharging it to surface water, the effluent limitations do not apply to that power station.\nEPA Waters of the US\nIn January 2020, the EPA and the Corps finalized a rule, called the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR), to define waters of the United States\u201d and thereby establish federal regulatory authority under the Clean Water Act. This final rule became effective in June 2020 and replaced the rule published in October 2019. While there have been numerous legal challenges filed in\nfederal court, there are no legal stays in effect. However, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) are in receipt of an order of the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona dated August 30, 2021, which vacates and remands the NWPR. As a result of this order, the agencies have halted implementation of the NWPR and are currently interpreting waters of the United States\u201d consistent with its meaning prior to the adoption of the 2015 rule that was repealed in October 2019. The EPA is also engaging in additional rulemaking to revise NWPR. In November 2021, the EPA and the Corps announced a proposed rule which would re-establish the pre-2015 definition of waters of the United States\u201d updated to reflect consideration of Supreme Court decisions\". Public hearings on the proposed new rule were held in January 2022. The agencies also established a comment period for the proposed rule which closed on February 7, 2022.\nSuperfund and Former Manufactured Gas Plant Sites\nTEC, through its Tampa Electric and PGS divisions, is a PRP for certain superfund sites and, through its PGS division, for certain former manufactured gas plant sites. While the joint and several liability associated with these sites presents the potential for significant response costs, as of December 31, 2021, TEC has estimated its ultimate financial liability to be $14 million, primarily at PGS. This amount has been accrued and is primarily reflected in the long-term liability section under Other\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The environmental remediation costs associated with these sites are expected to be paid over many years.\nThe estimated amounts represent only the portion of the cleanup costs attributable to TEC. The estimates to perform the work are based on TEC's experience with similar work, adjusted for site-specific conditions and agreements with the respective governmental agencies. The estimates are made in current dollars, are not discounted and do not assume any insurance recoveries.\nIn instances where other PRPs are involved, most of those PRPs are creditworthy and are likely to continue to be creditworthy for the duration of the remediation work. However, in those instances that they are not, TEC could be liable for more than TEC's actual percentage of the remediation costs.\nFactors that could impact these estimates include the ability of other PRPs to pay their pro-rata portion of the cleanup costs, additional testing and investigation which could expand the scope of the cleanup activities, additional liability that might arise from the cleanup activities themselves or changes in laws or regulations that could require additional remediation. Under current regulations, these costs are recoverable through customer rates established in subsequent base rate proceedings.\nCoal Combustion Residuals Recycling and Regulation\nTampa Electric produces ash and other by-products, collectively known as CCRs, at its Big Bend and Polk Power stations. An annual average of 95% of all CCRs produced at these facilities is marketed to customers for beneficial use in commercial and industrial products.\nThe EPA's final CCR rule became effective on October 19, 2015 and regulates CCRs as non-hazardous solid waste. On February 2, 2016, the FPSC approved Tampa Electric's proposed CCR compliance program for recovery of certain capital and O&M expenses through the ECRC. On December 12, 2017, the FPSC approved an additional petition for recovery of expenses associated with the closure of Tampa Electric's Big Bend Economizer Ash and Pyrite Ponds which began in late November 2018. The O&M expenses for disposal of CCRs from this project began in 2019 and continued through 2021. Closure of Tampa Electric's West Slag Dewatering Pond and improvements were completed in 2020. Final drainage improvements to Tampa Electric's North Gypsum Stackout Area will be completed in 2022. In August 2019, the EPA proposed Phase II revisions to the rule that included a revised beneficial use definition and restrictions on offsite beneficial use storage piles, both of which could negatively affect management and recycling of CCRs by TEC's customers for these products. Review of this rule is ongoing. FDEP has proposed a Florida CCR permitting program to be incorporated into the existing state solid waste regulation, which will operate in lieu of the Federal permitting program. However, since TEC has already closed all of its regulated CCR Units by October 2021, neither Federal nor State programs regulating CCRs would be expected to have a significant impact on TEC. See Note 12 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the estimated impact on Tampa Electric's AROs.\nConservation\nIn 2021, Tampa Electric continued to offer its customers a comprehensive array of residential and commercial Demand Side Management (DSM) programs. Tampa Electric suspended non-essential energy management field work due to the COVID pandemic in March 2020 and resumed normal operations in November 2021. As part of a five-year pilot program, Tampa Electric has completed the installation of a fully integrated renewable energy system that utilizes a large solar array integrated with battery storage and electric vehicle and large commercial vehicle battery charging system. As part of Tampa Electric's settlement agreement related to its 2021 rate case, Tampa Electric agreed to increase the amount of assistance provided to low-income customers in 2022 through conservation weatherization and energy education and to adjust the amount of credits provided to commercial and industrial customers for their participation in Tampa Electric's load management and demand response programs.\nIn 2021, Tampa Electric achieved all of its commercial annual energy and demand goals, the annual residential summer demand and annual energy goal, and the total combined annual energy and summer demand goals. To achieve these DSM goals, Tampa Electric offered 36 cost-effective DSM Programs. These programs and their costs are approved annually by the FPSC, with the costs recovered through a clause rate on the customer's electric bill. Since their inception to January 1, 2021, Tampa Electric's conservation programs have contributed to reducing the summer peak demand by 779 MWs and the winter peak demand by 1,288 MWs.\nIn 2020, PGS implemented an online energy audit program for residential customers. PGS expects to offer a walkthrough energy audit for commercial customers in 2022. Both programs were approved by the FPSC as part of its DSM goals in 2019. PGS received approval of its DSM plan in June 2021, which will support the achievement of these DSM goals on an annual basis. Starting in 2019, PGS initiated the reporting of annual energy reduction achievements as part of meeting the requirements of Florida Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act. In 2021, PGS' conservation programs saved 718,000 therms. These programs and their costs are approved annually by the FPSC, with the costs recovered through a clause rate on the customer's gas bill.\nREGULATION\nSee the Business section (Tampa Electric - Electric Operations and Peoples Gas System - Gas Operations sections) and Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the utilities' base rates, cost-recovery clauses and competition.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial performance of TEC, a regulated electric and gas utility company in Florida, for the year 2021.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS & RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nTEC has regulated electric and gas utility operations in Florida. At December 31, 2021, Tampa Electric served approximately 810,600 customers in a 2,000-square-mile service area in West Central Florida and had electric generating plants with a winter peak generating capacity of 5,919 MW. PGS, Florida's largest gas distribution utility, served approximately 445,300 residential, commercial, industrial and electric power generating customers at December 31, 2021 in all major metropolitan areas of the state, with a total natural gas throughput of approximately 1.9 billion therms in 2021.\nTEC is a wholly owned subsidiary of TECO Energy, and TECO Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera. Therefore, TEC is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Emera. See Note 10 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding related party transactions.\n2021 PERFORMANCE\nAll amounts included in this MD&A are pre-tax, except net income and income taxes.\nIn 2021, TEC's net income was $446 million, compared with $424 million in 2020. 2021 results were impacted by higher base revenues at PGS, lower O&M, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, at Tampa Electric and higher AFUDC at Tampa Electric, partially offset by higher depreciation expense at Tampa Electric and PGS. See Operating Results below for further detail regarding 2021 results as compared to 2020. For information regarding 2020 results as compared to 2019, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of TEC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOUTLOOK\nTEC's earnings are most directly impacted by the allowed rate of return on equity and the capital structures approved by the FPSC, the prudent management of operating costs, the approved recovery of regulatory deferrals, weather and its impact on energy sales, and the timing and amount of capital expenditures.\nTampa Electric anticipates earning within its ROE range in 2022. New base rates effective January 1, 2022 will result in Tampa Electric 2022 earnings to be higher than in 2021. Tampa Electric sales volumes in 2022 are expected to be similar to 2021, which benefited from weather that was warmer than normal (a 20-year statistical degree day average). Tampa Electric expects customer growth rates in 2022 to be consistent with 2021, reflective of current expected economic growth in Florida.\nIn 2022, PGS anticipates earning within its allowed ROE range and expects rate base and earnings to be higher than in 2021. PGS expects favorable customer growth in 2022, following Florida population growth and housing demand. PGS residential and commercial sales volumes in 2022 are expected to increase at a level consistent with customer growth.\nOn August 6, 2021, Tampa Electric filed with the FPSC a joint motion for approval of a settlement agreement dated as of August 6, 2021 (the Settlement Agreement) by and among Tampa Electric and the intervenors in Tampa Electric's rate case filed with the FPSC in April 2021. The Settlement Agreement agrees to an increase in base rates annually effective with January 2022 bills, to generate a $191 million increase in revenue consisting of $123 million of traditional base rate charges and $68 million in a new charge to recover the costs of retiring assets. The Settlement Agreement further includes two subsequent year adjustments of $90 million and $21 million, effective January 2023 and January 2024, respectively. Under the agreement, the allowed equity in the capital structure will continue to be 54% from investor sources of capital. The Settlement Agreement includes an allowed regulatory ROE range of 9.0% to 11.0% with a 9.95% midpoint. The Settlement Agreement allows a 25 basis point increase in the allowed ROE range and mid-point, and $10 million of additional revenue, if the average 30-year United States Treasury Bond yield rate for any period of six\nconsecutive months is at least 50 basis points greater than the yield rate on the date the FPSC votes to approve the agreement. Under the agreement, base rates will not change from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, unless Tampa Electric's earned ROE were to fall below the bottom of the range during that time. The Settlement Agreement contains a provision whereby Tampa Electric agrees to quantify the future impact of a decrease or increase in corporate income tax rates on net operating income through a reduction or increase in base revenues within 180 days of when such tax change becomes law or its effective date. The Settlement Agreement further creates a mechanism to recover the costs of retiring coal generation units and meter assets over a period of 15 years which survives the term of that agreement. The Settlement Agreement sets new depreciation and dismantlement rates effective January 1, 2022 and contains the provisions that Tampa Electric will not have to file another depreciation study during the term of the agreement but will file a new depreciation study no more than one year, nor less than 90 days, before the filing of its next general base rate proceeding. Additionally, Tampa Electric agreed to a financial hedging moratorium for natural gas ending on December 31, 2024. On October 21, 2021, the FPSC approved the Settlement Agreement and the final order, reflecting such approval, was issued on November 10, 2021. See Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIn January 2022, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges to recover an additional $169 million, effective with April 2022 customer bills, due to an increase in fuel commodity and capacity costs. The FPSC is expected to issue its decision in March 2022.\nTampa Electric has a capital investment program that supports achieving its goal to reduce CO2 emissions to 60% of 2000 levels by 2025. Since 2000, Tampa Electric has reduced its CO2 emissions by more than 50%.\n\tIn 2022, TEC expects to invest approximately $1.4 billion, excluding AFUDC, in capital projects consistent with $1.4 billion in 2021. Capital projects support normal system reliability and growth at the utilities. AFUDC will be earned on eligible capital projects during the construction periods. Tampa Electric investments include continuation of the modernization of the Big Bend Power Station, solar investments, grid modernization and storm hardening investments. PGS expects to make investments to expand its system and support customer growth, including expected investments related to compressed natural gas fueling stations, renewable natural gas, technology improvements and continued replacement of obsolete plastic, cast iron and bare steel pipe. See Capital Investments below for further information.\nThese forecasts are based on our current assumptions described in the operating company discussion, which are subject to risks and uncertainties (see the Risk Factors section).\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material financial impact on TEC's earnings in 2021. TEC's top priority continues to be the health and safety of its customers and employees. Management continues to monitor developments, economic conditions and recommendations by local and national public health authorities related to COVID-19 and is adjusting operational requirements as needed.\nTo date, customer defaults have not been material and as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, adjustments to the allowance for credit losses have not had a material impact on the financial statements. TEC is continuing to monitor customer accounts and to work with customers on payment arrangements.\nThe extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on TEC's financial results and business operations is uncertain at this time but is not expected to have a material financial impact in 2022.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nThis MD&A utilizes TEC's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our reported operating results are affected by several critical accounting estimates (see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section).\nThe following table shows the revenues and net income of the business segments on a U.S. GAAP basis (see Note 11 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nTAMPA ELECTRIC\nElectric Operations Results\nTampa Electric's net income in 2021 was $369 million, compared with $372 million in 2020. Results primarily reflected higher depreciation expense, partly due to a $16 million intangible software amortization credit in 2020 due to a regulatory agreement approved by the FPSC, and lower base revenues, partially offset by higher AFUDC earnings and lower O&M expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses. Base revenues are energy sales excluding revenues from clauses, gross receipts taxes and franchise fees. Clauses, gross receipts taxes and franchise fees do not have a material effect on net income as these revenues substantially represent a dollar-for-dollar recovery of clause and other pass-through costs. See the Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses sections below for additional information.\nThe table below provides a summary of Tampa Electric's revenue and expenses and energy sales by customer type.\nSummary of Operating Results\n\nOperating Revenues\nRevenues were $325 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to higher clause revenue driven by increased fuel costs. Base revenue was $11 million lower than in 2020 due to certain revenues now being recovered through the Storm Protection Plan Cost Recovery Clause and mild weather compared to 2020, partially offset by customer growth and higher base rates from additional solar generation projects being placed in-service. Total degree days (a measure of heating and cooling demand) in Tampa Electric's service area in 2021 were 6% above normal and 5% below 2020. Total net energy for load, which is a calendar measurement of energy output, was consistent with 2020.\nCustomer and Energy Sales Growth Outlook\nThe Tampa labor market continues to outperform the state and U.S. labor markets. Due to the reopening of businesses that had closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tampa area unemployment rate decreased to 4.4% in 2021 from 7.2% in 2020. Similarly, Florida's unemployment rate decreased to 4.9% in 2021 from 7.8% in 2020 and the U.S. rate dropped to 5.4% from 8.1% in 2020. The unemployment rate in the Tampa area is expected to decline over the next few years.\nPopulation growth in the area is forecasted to continue to be a major driver of customer growth. Tampa Electric expects customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.0% annually over the next few years, assuming continued economic recovery from COVID-19 and business expansion.\nFor the past several years, weather-normalized energy consumption per customer declined due to the combined effects of voluntary conservation efforts, improvements in lighting and equipment efficiency. It is expected to continue to decline annually at an average annual rate of 0.8% over the next few years.\nIn 2022, retail energy sales are expected to be similar to 2021 levels. In 2021, energy sales benefitted from weather that was warmer than normal, while 2022 projections are based on normal weather. Normalizing 2021 for weather, 2022 energy sales are projected to increase over 2021 primarily due to customer growth and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the longer term, residential energy sales growth is expected to be around 1.2% and total energy sales growth around 0.8%.\nOperating Expenses\nIn 2021, operations and maintenance expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, was $14 million lower than in 2020 primarily reflecting lower benefits expense and lower transmission and distribution costs related to the recovery of Storm Protection Plan clause expense previously recorded in non-clause O&M, partially offset by higher insurance costs related to increased solar generation. Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, increased $30 million in 2021 from normal additions to facilities to reliably serve customers and the in-service of solar generation projects, and a $16 million intangible software amortization credit in 2020 due to a regulatory agreement approved by the FPSC.\nExcluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clause-related expense, O&M expense in 2022 is expected to remain consistent with 2021 reflecting cost control efforts. In 2022, depreciation expense is expected to increase due to solar project timings and other plant additions.\nFuel Prices and Fuel Cost Recovery\nIn 2021, the FPSC approved cost-recovery rates for fuel and purchased power, capacity, environmental, conservation and storm protection costs for 2022. The rates include the expected cost for natural gas and coal in 2022, and a net prior period under-recovery true-up of fuel, purchased power and capacity clause expense. These rates are typically set annually, based on information provided in September of the year prior to the year the rates take effect.\nIn July 2021, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges, effective with September 2021 customer bills, due to an increase in fuel commodity and capacity costs in 2021. On August 3, 2021, the FPSC approved the request to recover $83 million of additional costs during the months of September through December 2021.\nTotal fuel expense increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to higher natural gas prices. Delivered natural gas prices increased 67% in 2021 as demand from a strong economic recovery outpaced supply.\nTotal 2022 fuel and purchased power costs are expected to be greater than in 2021, due to increased prices for natural gas. In January 2022, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges to recover an additional $169 million, effective with April 2022 customer bills, due to an increase in fuel commodity and capacity costs. The FPSC is expected to issue its decision in March 2022.\nPGS\nOperating Results\nIn 2021, PGS reported net income of $77 million, compared with $52 million in 2020. Results reflect a 4.5% increase in the number of customers in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues were $95 million higher than in the prior year primarily due to higher base rates that went into effect January 2021, customer growth, higher PGA clause-related revenues, and decreased commercial sales in 2020 resulting from COVID-19. These revenue increases were partially offset by lower revenue from the cast iron bare steel replacement rider that is now being recovered through the new base rates and lower off-system sales in 2021. The base revenues increase excluding the shift of cast iron bare steel rider-related revenue was $56 million. Operations and maintenance expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, was $6 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs to operate and maintain the growing distribution system and higher insurance costs. Depreciation and amortization increased $10 million due to asset growth (see Note 3 to the TEC Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn 2021 and 2020, total throughput for PGS was approximately 1.9 billion therms and 2.1 billion therms, respectively. See Business - Peoples Gas System- Gas Operations for information regarding therms by type of customer.\nPGS provides transportation service to customers utilizing gas-fired technology in the production of electric power. In addition, PGS provides gas transportation service to large LNG facilities located in Jacksonville, Florida. PGS has also experienced interest in the usage of CNG as an alternative fuel for vehicles, especially refuse trucks and buses. Therms sold to CNG stations in 2021 and 2020 were 39 million therms and 36 million therms, respectively. Currently, there are 56 CNG fueling stations connected to the PGS system. PGS owns three CNG filling stations, and the cost of these stations is recovered over time through a special rate approved by the FPSC. CNG conversions add therm sales to the gas system without requiring significant capital investment by PGS.\nThe table below provides a summary of PGS's revenue and expenses and therm sales by customer type.\nSummary of Operating Results\n\nSee Business-Peoples Gas System-Competition for information regarding PGS's transportation-only customers.\nPGS Outlook\nIn 2022, PGS anticipates earning within its allowed ROE range and expects rate base and earnings to be higher than in 2021. PGS expects customer growth in 2022 to be higher than Florida's population growth rates, reflecting expectations of continued strong housing demand in Florida. Assuming normal weather, PGS sales volumes are expected to increase consistent with customer growth.\nExcluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clause-related expenses, O&M expense in 2022 is expected to be higher than in 2021, driven by initiatives to enhance the customer experience and safely and reliably operate and maintain a growing distribution system. Due to the projected reversal of accumulated depreciation as provided for in PGS's 2020 settlement agreement (see Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), depreciation and amortization expense is expected to decrease in 2022.\nIn addition to the strong residential construction market, PGS is focusing on extending the system to serve large commercial and industrial customers that are currently relying on other energy sources. The relatively low natural gas prices and the lower emissions levels from using natural gas compared to other fuels make it attractive for these customers to convert.\nOTHER ITEMS IMPACTING NET INCOME\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net was $50 million and $36 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and included AFUDC-equity. AFUDC-equity was $45 million and $30 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in AFUDC-equity is primarily due to the timing of Tampa Electric's solar projects and the modernization of its Big Bend Power Station as discussed in the Capital Investments section below. AFUDC is expected to increase in 2022 due to the timing of construction of the Big Bend modernization, solar generation, grid modernization and PGS expansion projects.\nInterest Expense\nIn 2021, interest expense, excluding AFUDC-debt, was $151 million compared to $144 million in 2020. The increase is due to an increase in borrowings to support TEC's ongoing capital investments program.\nInterest expense is expected to increase in 2022, reflecting higher balances and interest rates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes decreased in 2021 primarily due to higher tax benefits due to AFUDC and ITC amortization related to solar projects, partially offset by higher pre-tax income and lower R&D tax credits. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 15.2% in 2021 and 16.2% in 2020. TEC expects the 2022 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nTEC is included in a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with EUSHI and its subsidiaries. TEC's income tax expense is based upon a separate return method, modified for the benefits-for-loss allocation in accordance with TECO Energy's and EUSHI's respective tax sharing agreements. The cash payments for federal income taxes and state income taxes made under those tax sharing agreements totaled $62 million and $14 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor more information on our income taxes, including a reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate, the effective tax rate and impacts of tax reform, see Note 4 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBalances as of December 31, 2021\n\nCash from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities in 2021 were $797 million, a decrease of $32 million compared to 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the timing of fuel clause and conservation clause revenue recovery, higher accounts receivables balances due to increasing fuel prices reflected in customer bills and higher inventory balances due to plant growth, partially offset by the timing of invoice payments and new PGS customer rates going into effect in January 2021.\nCash from Investing Activities\nCash flows from investing activities in 2021 resulted in a net use of cash of $1.4 billion, which primarily reflects TEC's investment in capital. See the Capital Investments section for additional information.\nCash from Financing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities in 2021 resulted in net cash inflows of $608 million. TEC received $790 million of proceeds from long-term debt, $580 million of equity contributions from Parent and $500 million proceeds from the 1-year term credit agreement. These increases in cash flows were partially offset by dividend payments to Parent of $450 million, repayment of a 1-year term credit agreement of $300 million, repayment of long-term debt of $279 million and a decrease in short-term debt with maturities of less than 90 days of $230 million.\nCash and Liquidity Outlook\nTEC's tariff-based gross margins are the principal source of cash from operating activities. A diversified retail customer mix, primarily consisting of rate-regulated residential, commercial, and industrial customers, provides TEC with a reasonably predictable source of cash. In addition to using cash generated from operating activities, TEC uses available cash and credit facility and commercial paper borrowings to support normal operations and capital requirements. TEC may reduce short-term borrowings with cash from operations, long-term borrowings, or capital contributions from Parent. TEC expects to make significant capital expenditures in 2022 as it invests in solar projects, the modernization of the Big Bend power plant, gas distribution system expansion and other projects. See Capital Investments section below for further detail on TEC's projected capital expenditures. TEC intends to fund those capital expenditures with available cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities, cash from equity contributions and debt issuances so that Tampa Electric and PGS maintain their capital structures consistent with the regulatory arrangements. Debt raised is subject to applicable regulatory approvals. Future financial market conditions could increase TEC's interest costs which could reduce earnings and cash flows.\nAs noted earlier, cash from operating activities and short-term borrowings are used to fund capital expenditures, which may result in periodic working capital deficits. The working capital deficit as of December 31, 2021 was primarily caused by short-term borrowings and periodic fluctuations in assets and liabilities related to FPSC clauses and riders. At December 31, 2021, TEC's unused capacity under its credit facilities was $554 million.\nTEC has credit facilities and commercial paper that provide $1,300 million of credit, including $500 million maturing in 2022 and $800 million maturing in 2026. See Note 6 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the credit facilities and commercial paper. TEC expects that its liquidity will be adequate for both the near and long term, given its expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures and related financing plans.\nTEC expects cash from operations in 2022 to be higher than in 2021 primarily due to an increase in base rates effective in January 2022, higher cash inflows from fuel and cost of gas sold, and customer growth (see Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements). TEC plans to use cash in 2022 to fund capital spending and to pay dividends to its shareholder. Dividends are paid at the discretion of TEC's Board of Directors.\nTEC's credit facilities contain certain financial covenants (see Covenants", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS & RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nTEC has regulated electric and gas utility operations in Florida. At December 31, 2021, Tampa Electric served approximately 810,600 customers in a 2,000-square-mile service area in West Central Florida and had electric generating plants with a winter peak generating capacity of 5,919 MW. PGS, Florida's largest gas distribution utility, served approximately 445,300 residential, commercial, industrial and electric power generating customers at December 31, 2021 in all major metropolitan areas of the state, with a total natural gas throughput of approximately 1.9 billion therms in 2021.\nTEC is a wholly owned subsidiary of TECO Energy, and TECO Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera. Therefore, TEC is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Emera. See Note 10 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding related party transactions.\n2021 PERFORMANCE\nAll amounts included in this MD&A are pre-tax, except net income and income taxes.\nIn 2021, TEC's net income was $446 million, compared with $424 million in 2020. 2021 results were impacted by higher base revenues at PGS, lower O&M, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, at Tampa Electric and higher AFUDC at Tampa Electric, partially offset by higher depreciation expense at Tampa Electric and PGS. See Operating Results below for further detail regarding 2021 results as compared to 2020. For information regarding 2020 results as compared to 2019, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of TEC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOUTLOOK\nTEC's earnings are most directly impacted by the allowed rate of return on equity and the capital structures approved by the FPSC, the prudent management of operating costs, the approved recovery of regulatory deferrals, weather and its impact on energy sales, and the timing and amount of capital expenditures.\nTampa Electric anticipates earning within its ROE range in 2022. New base rates effective January 1, 2022 will result in Tampa Electric 2022 earnings to be higher than in 2021. Tampa Electric sales volumes in 2022 are expected to be similar to 2021, which benefited from weather that was warmer than normal (a 20-year statistical degree day average). Tampa Electric expects customer growth rates in 2022 to be consistent with 2021, reflective of current expected economic growth in Florida.\nIn 2022, PGS anticipates earning within its allowed ROE range and expects rate base and earnings to be higher than in 2021. PGS expects favorable customer growth in 2022, following Florida population growth and housing demand. PGS residential and commercial sales volumes in 2022 are expected to increase at a level consistent with customer growth.\nOn August 6, 2021, Tampa Electric filed with the FPSC a joint motion for approval of a settlement agreement dated as of August 6, 2021 (the Settlement Agreement) by and among Tampa Electric and the intervenors in Tampa Electric's rate case filed with the FPSC in April 2021. The Settlement Agreement agrees to an increase in base rates annually effective with January 2022 bills, to generate a $191 million increase in revenue consisting of $123 million of traditional base rate charges and $68 million in a new charge to recover the costs of retiring assets. The Settlement Agreement further includes two subsequent year adjustments of $90 million and $21 million, effective January 2023 and January 2024, respectively. Under the agreement, the allowed equity in the capital structure will continue to be 54% from investor sources of capital. The Settlement Agreement includes an allowed regulatory ROE range of 9.0% to 11.0% with a 9.95% midpoint. The Settlement Agreement allows a 25 basis point increase in the allowed ROE range and mid-point, and $10 million of additional revenue, if the average 30-year United States Treasury Bond yield rate for any period of six\nconsecutive months is at least 50 basis points greater than the yield rate on the date the FPSC votes to approve the agreement. Under the agreement, base rates will not change from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, unless Tampa Electric's earned ROE were to fall below the bottom of the range during that time. The Settlement Agreement contains a provision whereby Tampa Electric agrees to quantify the future impact of a decrease or increase in corporate income tax rates on net operating income through a reduction or increase in base revenues within 180 days of when such tax change becomes law or its effective date. The Settlement Agreement further creates a mechanism to recover the costs of retiring coal generation units and meter assets over a period of 15 years which survives the term of that agreement. The Settlement Agreement sets new depreciation and dismantlement rates effective January 1, 2022 and contains the provisions that Tampa Electric will not have to file another depreciation study during the term of the agreement but will file a new depreciation study no more than one year, nor less than 90 days, before the filing of its next general base rate proceeding. Additionally, Tampa Electric agreed to a financial hedging moratorium for natural gas ending on December 31, 2024. On October 21, 2021, the FPSC approved the Settlement Agreement and the final order, reflecting such approval, was issued on November 10, 2021. See Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIn January 2022, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges to recover an additional $169 million, effective with April 2022 customer bills, due to an increase in fuel commodity and capacity costs. The FPSC is expected to issue its decision in March 2022.\nTampa Electric has a capital investment program that supports achieving its goal to reduce CO2 emissions to 60% of 2000 levels by 2025. Since 2000, Tampa Electric has reduced its CO2 emissions by more than 50%.\n\tIn 2022, TEC expects to invest approximately $1.4 billion, excluding AFUDC, in capital projects consistent with $1.4 billion in 2021. Capital projects support normal system reliability and growth at the utilities. AFUDC will be earned on eligible capital projects during the construction periods. Tampa Electric investments include continuation of the modernization of the Big Bend Power Station, solar investments, grid modernization and storm hardening investments. PGS expects to make investments to expand its system and support customer growth, including expected investments related to compressed natural gas fueling stations, renewable natural gas, technology improvements and continued replacement of obsolete plastic, cast iron and bare steel pipe. See Capital Investments below for further information.\nThese forecasts are based on our current assumptions described in the operating company discussion, which are subject to risks and uncertainties (see the Risk Factors section).\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material financial impact on TEC's earnings in 2021. TEC's top priority continues to be the health and safety of its customers and employees. Management continues to monitor developments, economic conditions and recommendations by local and national public health authorities related to COVID-19 and is adjusting operational requirements as needed.\nTo date, customer defaults have not been material and as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, adjustments to the allowance for credit losses have not had a material impact on the financial statements. TEC is continuing to monitor customer accounts and to work with customers on payment arrangements.\nThe extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on TEC's financial results and business operations is uncertain at this time but is not expected to have a material financial impact in 2022.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nThis MD&A utilizes TEC's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our reported operating results are affected by several critical accounting estimates (see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section).\nThe following table shows the revenues and net income of the business segments on a U.S. GAAP basis (see Note 11 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements).\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tampa Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PGS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TEC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tampa Electric\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PGS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TEC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTAMPA ELECTRIC\nElectric Operations Results\nTampa Electric's net income in 2021 was $369 million, compared with $372 million in 2020. Results primarily reflected higher depreciation expense, partly due to a $16 million intangible software amortization credit in 2020 due to a regulatory agreement approved by the FPSC, and lower base revenues, partially offset by higher AFUDC earnings and lower O&M expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses. Base revenues are energy sales excluding revenues from clauses, gross receipts taxes and franchise fees. Clauses, gross receipts taxes and franchise fees do not have a material effect on net income as these revenues substantially represent a dollar-for-dollar recovery of clause and other pass-through costs. See the Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses sections below for additional information.\nThe table below provides a summary of Tampa Electric's revenue and expenses and energy sales by customer

higher than in 2020 primarily due to higher clause revenue driven by increased fuel costs. Base revenue was $11 million lower than in 2020 due to certain revenues now being recovered through the Storm Protection Plan Cost Recovery Clause and mild weather compared to 2020, partially offset by customer growth and higher base rates from additional solar generation projects being placed in-service. Total degree days (a measure of heating and cooling demand) in Tampa Electric's service area in 2021 were 6% above normal and 5% below 2020. Total net energy for load, which is a calendar measurement of energy output, was consistent with 2020.\nCustomer and Energy Sales Growth Outlook\nThe Tampa labor market continues to outperform the state and U.S. labor markets. Due to the reopening of businesses that had closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tampa area unemployment rate decreased to 4.4% in 2021 from 7.2% in 2020. Similarly, Florida's unemployment rate decreased to 4.9% in 2021 from 7.8% in 2020 and the U.S. rate dropped to 5.4% from 8.1% in 2020. The unemployment rate in the Tampa area is expected to decline over the next few years.\nPopulation growth in the area is forecasted to continue to be a major driver of customer growth. Tampa Electric expects customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.0% annually over the next few years, assuming continued economic recovery from COVID-19 and business expansion.\nFor the past several years, weather-normalized energy consumption per customer declined due to the combined effects of voluntary conservation efforts, improvements in lighting and equipment efficiency. It is expected to continue to decline annually at an average annual rate of 0.8% over the next few years.\nIn 2022, retail energy sales are expected to be similar to 2021 levels. In 2021, energy sales benefitted from weather that was warmer than normal, while 2022 projections are based on normal weather. Normalizing 2021 for weather, 2022 energy sales are projected to increase over 2021 primarily due to customer growth and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the longer term, residential energy sales growth is expected to be around 1.2% and total energy sales growth around 0.8%.\nOperating Expenses\nIn 2021, operations and maintenance expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, was $14 million lower than in 2020 primarily reflecting lower benefits expense and lower transmission and distribution costs related to the recovery of Storm Protection Plan clause expense previously recorded in non-clause O&M, partially offset by higher insurance costs related to increased solar generation. Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, increased $30 million in 2021 from normal additions to facilities to reliably serve customers and the in-service of solar generation projects, and a $16 million intangible software amortization credit in 2020 due to a regulatory agreement approved by the FPSC.\nExcluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clause-related expense, O&M expense in 2022 is expected to remain consistent with 2021 reflecting cost control efforts. In 2022, depreciation expense is expected to increase due to solar project timings and other plant additions.\nFuel Prices and Fuel Cost Recovery\nIn 2021, the FPSC approved cost-recovery rates for fuel and purchased power, capacity, environmental, conservation and storm protection costs for 2022. The rates include the expected cost for natural gas and coal in 2022, and a net prior period under-recovery true-up of fuel, purchased power and capacity clause expense. These rates are typically set annually, based on information provided in September of the year prior to the year the rates take effect.\nIn July 2021, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges, effective with September 2021 customer bills, due to an increase in fuel commodity and capacity costs in 2021. On August 3, 2021, the FPSC approved the request to recover $83 million of additional costs during the months of September through December 2021.\nTotal fuel expense increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to higher natural gas prices. Delivered natural gas prices increased 67% in 2021 as demand from a strong economic recovery outpaced supply.\nTotal 2022 fuel and purchased power costs are expected to be greater than in 2021, due to increased prices for natural gas. In January 2022, Tampa Electric requested a mid-course adjustment to its fuel and capacity charges to recover an additional $169 million, effective with April 2022 customer bills, due to an increase in fuel commodity and capacity costs. The FPSC is expected to issue its decision in March 2022.\nPGS\nOperating Results\nIn 2021, PGS reported net income of $77 million, compared with $52 million in 2020. Results reflect a 4.5% increase in the number of customers in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues were $95 million higher than in the prior year primarily due to higher base rates that went into effect January 2021, customer growth, higher PGA clause-related revenues, and decreased commercial sales in 2020 resulting from COVID-19. These revenue increases were partially offset by lower revenue from the cast iron bare steel replacement rider that is now being recovered through the new base rates and lower off-system sales in 2021. The base revenues increase excluding the shift of cast iron bare steel rider-related revenue was $56 million. Operations and maintenance expense, excluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clauses, was $6 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs to operate and maintain the growing distribution system and higher insurance costs. Depreciation and amortization increased $10 million due to asset growth (see Note 3 to the TEC Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn 2021 and 2020, total throughput for PGS was approximately 1.9 billion therms and 2.1 billion therms, respectively. See Business - Peoples Gas System- Gas Operations for information regarding therms by type of customer.\nPGS provides transportation service to customers utilizing gas-fired technology in the production of electric power. In addition, PGS provides gas transportation service to large LNG facilities located in Jacksonville, Florida. PGS has also experienced interest in the usage of CNG as an alternative fuel for vehicles, especially refuse trucks and buses. Therms sold to CNG stations in 2021 and 2020 were 39 million therms and 36 million therms, respectively. Currently, there are 56 CNG fueling stations connected to the PGS system. PGS owns three CNG filling stations, and the cost of these stations is recovered over time through a special rate approved by the FPSC. CNG conversions add therm sales to the gas system without requiring significant capital investment by PGS.\nThe table below provides a summary of PGS's revenue and expenses and therm sales by customer type.\nSummary of Operating Results\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions, except customers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of gas sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Therms sold -

PGS expects customer growth in 2022 to be higher than Florida's population growth rates, reflecting expectations of continued strong housing demand in Florida. Assuming normal weather, PGS sales volumes are expected to increase consistent with customer growth.\nExcluding all FPSC-approved cost-recovery clause-related expenses, O&M expense in 2022 is expected to be higher than in 2021, driven by initiatives to enhance the customer experience and safely and reliably operate and maintain a growing distribution system. Due to the projected reversal of accumulated depreciation as provided for in PGS's 2020 settlement agreement (see Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), depreciation and amortization expense is expected to decrease in 2022.\nIn addition to the strong residential construction market, PGS is focusing on extending the system to serve large commercial and industrial customers that are currently relying on other energy sources. The relatively low natural gas prices and the lower emissions levels from using natural gas compared to other fuels make it attractive for these customers to convert.\nOTHER ITEMS IMPACTING NET INCOME\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net was $50 million and $36 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and included AFUDC-equity. AFUDC-equity was $45 million and $30 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in AFUDC-equity is primarily due to the timing of Tampa Electric's solar projects and the modernization of its Big Bend Power Station as discussed in the Capital Investments section below. AFUDC is expected to increase in 2022 due to the timing of construction of the Big Bend modernization, solar generation, grid modernization and PGS expansion projects.\nInterest Expense\nIn 2021, interest expense, excluding AFUDC-debt, was $151 million compared to $144 million in 2020. The increase is due to an increase in borrowings to support TEC's ongoing capital investments program.\nInterest expense is expected to increase in 2022, reflecting higher balances and interest rates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes decreased in 2021 primarily due to higher tax benefits due to AFUDC and ITC amortization related to solar projects, partially offset by higher pre-tax income and lower R&D tax credits. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 15.2% in 2021 and 16.2% in 2020. TEC expects the 2022 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nTEC is included in a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with EUSHI and its subsidiaries. TEC's income tax expense is based upon a separate return method, modified for the benefits-for-loss allocation in accordance with TECO Energy's and EUSHI's respective tax sharing agreements. The cash payments for federal income taxes and state income taxes made under those tax sharing agreements totaled $62 million and $14 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor more information on our income taxes, including a reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate, the effective tax rate and impacts of tax reform, see Note 4 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBalances as of December 31, 2021\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Credit facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Drawn amounts/LCs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Available credit facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash and short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities in 2021 were $797 million, a decrease of $32 million compared to 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the timing of fuel clause and conservation clause revenue recovery, higher accounts receivables balances due to increasing fuel prices reflected in customer bills and higher inventory balances due to plant growth, partially offset by the timing of invoice payments and new PGS customer rates going into effect in January 2021.\nCash from Investing Activities\nCash flows from investing activities in 2021 resulted in a net use of cash of $1.4 billion, which primarily reflects TEC's investment in capital. See the Capital Investments section for additional information.\nCash from Financing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities in 2021 resulted in net cash inflows of $608 million. TEC received $790 million of proceeds from long-term debt, $580 million of equity contributions from Parent and $500 million proceeds from the 1-year term credit agreement. These increases in cash flows were partially offset by dividend payments to Parent of $450 million, repayment of a 1-year term credit agreement of $300 million, repayment of long-term debt of $279 million and a decrease in short-term debt with maturities of less than 90 days of $230 million.\nCash and Liquidity Outlook\nTEC's tariff-based gross margins are the principal source of cash from operating activities. A diversified retail customer mix, primarily consisting of rate-regulated residential, commercial, and industrial customers, provides TEC with a reasonably predictable source of cash. In addition to using cash generated from operating activities, TEC uses available cash and credit facility and commercial paper borrowings to support normal operations and capital requirements. TEC may reduce short-term borrowings with cash from operations, long-term borrowings, or capital contributions from Parent. TEC expects to make significant capital expenditures in 2022 as it invests in solar projects, the modernization of the Big Bend power plant, gas distribution system expansion and other projects. See Capital Investments section below for further detail on TEC's projected capital expenditures. TEC intends to fund those capital expenditures with available cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities, cash from equity contributions and debt issuances so that Tampa Electric and PGS maintain their capital structures consistent with the regulatory arrangements. Debt raised is subject to applicable regulatory approvals. Future financial market conditions could increase TEC's interest costs which could reduce earnings and cash flows.\nAs noted earlier, cash from operating activities and short-term borrowings are used to fund capital expenditures, which may result in periodic working capital deficits. The working capital deficit as of December 31, 2021 was primarily caused by short-term borrowings and periodic fluctuations in assets and liabilities related to FPSC clauses and riders. At December 31, 2021, TEC's unused capacity under its credit facilities was $554 million.\nTEC has credit facilities and commercial paper that provide $1,300 million of credit, including $500 million maturing in 2022 and $800 million maturing in 2026. See Note 6 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the credit facilities and commercial paper. TEC expects that its liquidity will be adequate for both the near and long term, given its expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures and related financing plans.\nTEC expects cash from operations in 2022 to be higher than in 2021 primarily due to an increase in base rates effective in January 2022, higher cash inflows from fuel and cost of gas sold, and customer growth (see Note 3 to the 2021 Annual TEC Consolidated Financial Statements). TEC plans to use cash in 2022 to fund capital spending and to pay dividends to its shareholder. Dividends are paid at the discretion of TEC's Board of Directors.\nTEC's credit facilities contain certain financial covenants (see Covenants"}
