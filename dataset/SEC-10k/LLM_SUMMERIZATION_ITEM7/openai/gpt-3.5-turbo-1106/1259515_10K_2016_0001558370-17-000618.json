Our entertainment, smart lighting, comfort and convenience, safety and security, and networking solutions unlock the potential of connected devices, making entertainment systems easier to use and more accessible, homes and businesses more comfortable and energy efficient, and individuals more secure. Our premium smart home and small business solutions provide consumers with the ability to integrate audio, video, lighting, temperature, security, communications, network management and other functionalities into a unified automation solution, customized to match their lifestyles and business needs. Our advanced software, delivered through our controller products, cloud services and user-interface products power this customized experience, enabling cohesive interoperability with thousands of connected Control4 and third-party devices.\nConsumers purchase our smart solutions from our worldwide network of certified independent dealers, regional and national retailers and distributors. These dealers, retailers and distributors design and install customized solutions to fit the specific needs of each consumer, whether it is a one-room home theater set-up or a whole-home automation\nsystem that features the integration of audio, video, lighting, temperature, security, network management and communications devices. Our products are installed in both new and existing residences, multi-dwelling units and small commercial facilities. We refer to revenue from sales of our products through these dealers, retailers and distributors as our Core revenue ( Core revenue\u201d). In addition, a portion of our revenue is attributable to sales in the hospitality industry, primarily related to products installed in hotels, which is excluded from our calculation of Core revenue. Our revenue from sales to hotels is generally project-based and has been significant in some periods and insignificant in other periods. In the future, we expect revenue from hospitality to continue to be project-based and uneven from period to period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, over 3,900 active direct dealers were authorized to sell and install the full Control4 line of products in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and 48 other countries, and partnered with 29 distributors to cover an additional 46 countries where we do not have direct dealer relationships. These distributors sell our solutions through dealers and provide warehousing, training, technical support, and billing for dealers in each of those countries. We also have an additional 1,000 active dealers and 17 distributors that are currently authorized to sell our Pakedge line of products only.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of products that contain our proprietary software, which functions as the operating system of the home. We also generate revenue from the sale of annual subscriptions to our 4Sight subscription service, which allows consumers to remotely access, backup, and control their smart home solutions from their mobile devices; receive e-mail and push notification\u201d alerts regarding activities in their home and enable Amazon Alexa voice services.\nWe were founded in 2003 and began shipping our products and generating revenue in 2005. Our revenue growth rates for the last five complete calendar years are shown in the following table (dollars in millions):\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n203.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n160.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n126.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n105.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore revenue growth over prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenue changes over prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n208.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n163.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n148.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n128.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n109.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue growth over prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOver the past five years, we have experienced double-digit annual Core revenue growth. Our Core revenue growth during that period has been the result of a combination of both the net addition of new independent dealers and distributors to our sales channels, an increase in revenue from our existing network of independent dealers and distributors, and new products both developed internally and acquired through business combinations. We believe our ability to grow our core sales channel has been enhanced through product innovation, expansion of our product offerings and helping our independent dealers and distributors grow their business and gross margins by providing enhanced dealer installation and marketing tools. Some recent developments that we believe may enhance our offerings and help drive growth include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAnnounced integration with Amazon Alexa, the popular voice service that powers Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices, including Echo Dot, Amazon Tap and Amazon Fire TV.

Recent acquisitions of technology and distribution-related business are as follows:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIn April 2016, we transitioned from a two-tier distribution model to direct-to-dealer in Australia, and as part of this process, acquired customer lists and inventory of the former distributor;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIn January 2016, we acquired Pakedge, a developer and manufacturer of networking products, power distribution and management solutions, as well as cloud network-managed services for both wireless and wired networking solutions in the connected home and business.

Pakedge brings to Control4 deep networking expertise, innovative technologies, and a sophisticated suite of newly refreshed networking products and rich software capability; and,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIn January 2015, we acquired Nexus, a developer and manufacturer of the Leaf brand of custom audio/video distribution and switching systems. We previously sold certain Leaf products under our Control4 brand and through our online ordering platform. After this acquisition, we began offering a complete line of video distribution solutions under the Control4 brand to Control4 customers worldwide, we gained market share in the growing audio and video (A/V) category, and we leveraged Nexus's valuable engineering expertise to develop new and innovative A/V solutions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe plan to continue to identify, acquire and integrate strategic technologies, assets and businesses that we believe will enhance the overall strength of our business, allow us to streamline sales, technical support and training, and enhance our dealers' ability to grow their businesses.\nHistorically, we have experienced seasonal variations in our revenue as a result of holiday-related factors that are common in our industry. Our revenue is generally highest in the fourth quarter due to consumers' desires to complete their home installations prior to the holiday season. We generally see decreased sales in the first quarter due to seasonal purchase tendencies of consumers as well as the impact of winter weather on new construction and travel in certain geographies. In addition, our year-over-year revenue growth on a quarterly basis is not always linear for a variety of reasons including: the timing of new product releases, the use of marketing programs to accelerate intra-quarter sales of certain products or product families, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and the impact of general regional economic conditions on consumer buying decisions and harsh weather that delayed or canceled building projects. We generally expect these seasonal and other trends to continue in the future, which may cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations and certain financial metrics.\nFactors and Trends Affecting Our Performance\nA number of industry trends have facilitated our growth over the past several years, including the proliferation of connected devices and the constant growth of network-enabled homes and businesses. From smartphones to smart\nwatches to smart cars, technology is transforming nearly every aspect of our lives, streamlining daily routines and providing quick, easy access to the capabilities and content we want most. Not only are new technologies providing convenience on-the-go, but they are becoming increasingly accessible. Voice services is a recent example of an emerging technology in our connected world, and our integration with Amazon Alexa helps keep us at the forefront of our industry in our adoption of voice activated solutions. We remain committed to embracing emerging technologies through our open platform and broad ecosystem.\nOur open platform makes it easy for a broad community of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners to participate in our smart home ecosystem, which includes over 10,100 drivers and more than 2,000 SDDP-enabled products. Our broad ecosystem, which includes audio, video, lighting, temperature, network, security and communication device categories, gives consumers flexibility to integrate nearly any connectable device into their smart home. In addition, our partners are constantly contributing new device integrations. As such, our dynamic ecosystem remains current with the latest product innovations and allows our smart home platform to grow alongside emerging technologies to meet our consumers' changing needs and preferences. We believe that our open platform and the resulting ecosystem is a key competitive advantage that will continue to facilitate our growth.\nOur products leverage both wired and wireless technologies and are designed to be installed in both new construction and existing homes. We expect that future increases in both new home construction and existing home renovations will have a positive impact on our revenue. In new home construction, we continue to engage builders to introduce entry- to mid-level Control4 systems as a standard feature in new home projects. We believe home automation is increasingly becoming a higher priority for home buyers, and this is one of the reasons for our investment in national and regional builder programs.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including the rates at which consumers adopt our products and services, our commitment to growing the awareness of our brands, our ability to optimize and expand our dealer and distributor network, our ability to expand internationally, our ability to meet competitive challenges, and our ability to respond to worldwide economic events. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain or expand the growth of our business and improve our results of operations. These challenges include:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncreasing Adoption Rates of Our Products and Services. We are focused on increasing adoption rates of our products and services through enhancements to our software platform and product offerings.

We are committed to growing awareness of the Control4 and Pakedge brands among our dealers, distributors and partners. We believe that our investments in creating brand awareness in the industry has contributed to dealer recruitment, product adoption, and revenue growth. We are proud of the many awards we received from various industry groups and dealer consortiums, formally recognizing our commitment to excellence. In September 2016, we received two Best of Show\u201d Awards at the Custom Electronics Design and Installation Association ( CEDIA\u201d) 2016 for Control4 Amazon Alexa Smart Home and our NK-1 Wireless Controller + Bakpak. CEDIA 2016 also awarded us the Technology Integrator Impact!\u201d Award for our EA Series controllers. In June 2016, Control4 was named as the top Whole-Home Automation brand, and Pakedge was named the top networking brand, by the 2016 CE Pro 100 Brand Analysis\u201d report. This is the second year in a row that Control4 was recognized as the top Whole-Home Automation brand, and the fourth year in a row that Pakedge has been named the top brand for home networking. In addition, Control4 solutions were recognized as the top brand in the categories of whole-house audio/video, access control, and HVAC/thermostats; and among the leading brands in the categories of lighting control, remote controls, and communications (phones/intercoms). Finally, in May 2016, the ProSource Buying Group named Control4 the 2016 Custom Integration Vendor of the Year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAccelerating and Enhancing Consumer Lead Generation.

We have transitioned to a direct-to-dealer model in specific international regions, namely in the United Kingdom, China, India, Germany and Australia, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities in other countries. Furthermore, we have opened new international training centers in Germany and Australia to help support the transition to a direct-to-dealer model.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nManaging Competition. The market for home automation is fragmented, highly competitive and continually evolving. In addition to competing with traditional players in the luxury segment of the home automation market, including Savant, Crestron and Elan, a number of large technology companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Samsung offer device control capabilities within some of their own products, applications and services, and are engaged in ongoing efforts to address the broader home automation market. In addition, managed service companies such as ADT, Comcast, and Vivint, have broadened their service offerings to include control of devices such as door locks, lights, and cameras. Our ability to compete in the growing home automation market over the next several years will be a key factor in our ability to continue to grow our business and meet or exceed our future expectations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nImpact of the United Kingdom's Vote to Leave the European Union. On June 23, 2016, the citizens of the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d) voted to leave ( Brexit\u201d) the European Union ( EU\u201d) raising concerns of a potential slowdown in the UK's economy specifically and the EU in general. We engaged with our dealers in the UK to assess their perception of how the Brexit vote might impact their business in the near and long-term. Their responses are varied and reflect the uncertainty that currently exists in the market. We will continue to monitor the risks and uncertainties throughout what is expected to be a lengthy process. The Brexit vote had the immediate impact of devaluing the pound sterling relative to the euro and the U.S. dollar. In Europe, we generally sell our products and incur expense in local currencies including the pound sterling and the euro, but incur exchange rate gains and losses for U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities including intercompany and third-party accounts receivables and payables. We enter into forward contracts to help offset our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to these types of U.S. dollar denominated balances. When consolidating the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries, we translate local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates during the period, resulting in either higher or lower net income depending on changes in the relative value of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. Brexit is not expected to have a material impact on our future consolidated net income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisition of Pakedge\nIn January 2016, we acquired Pakedge, a developer and manufacturer of networking products, power distribution and management solutions, as well as cloud network-managed services for both wireless and wired networking solutions in the connected home and business. As of September 30, 2016, the integration of Pakedge was complete, which included the consolidation of the warehousing and shipping of products, ERP system, web portal, and training facilities.\nLike Control4, Pakedge conducts its business through a broad channel of independent dealers, of which, only one-third were certified dealers of the entire Control4 product line at the time of acquisition. We expect to grow Pakedge product sales through our network of more than 3,900 active, certified Control4 dealers. From the date of acquisition in January 2016 through December 2016, over 1,500 additional certified Control4 dealers have started purchasing and begun selling Pakedge networking products, generating revenue of approximately $8.3 million.\nWe intend to grow both the Pakedge product business and the Control4 product business through our combined dealer channel of over 4,900 total active dealers. We believe Pakedge provides a significant boost to our development capabilities, our solution portfolio, and business flexibility moving forward. For the year-ended December 31, 2016, Pakedge was accretive to our growth, while contributing positively to our net income for the year.\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics\nWe use the following key

reach more potential consumers across more geographic regions. We expect our dealer network to continue to grow, both in North America and internationally. While we have historically focused on dealers affiliated with CEDIA, we believe there is an opportunity to establish relationships with dealers outside of CEDIA, including non-traditional A/V dealers, electrical contractors, and security system installers.\nWe continue to invest in tools and technologies to help our dealers be more successful and increase the year-over-year sales of our products. Our goal is to continuously increase our dealers' productivity and growth. Enabling our dealers to increase productivity will ultimately drive our revenue growth.\nAs part of our normal process for developing a productive, capable dealer network, we regularly review individual dealer performance and as necessary, terminate dealer agreements where volume, technical training and performance requirements are not being fulfilled. We view this as a healthy part of growing our customer install direct dealer channel worldwide. We continue to add new dealers, expanding both our North America and international direct dealer networks.\nAs a result of our traditional efforts to expand our channel, the number of active international dealers increased 29% and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, compared to an increase of 6% and 6% respectively, in the number of active North American direct dealers during the same periods. Generally, the growth percentage internationally is higher because our presence in these markets is less mature and our base of dealers is much lower than the North American market. Much of this growth in our international dealer network is attributed to new dealer additions in China, Germany and Australia. In April 2016, we started selling direct-to-dealers in the Australian market immediately adding 100 new active international dealers. We plan to continue to monitor other markets that are currently served by a single distributor and, when business conditions are favorable, we may decide to establish direct relationships with selected dealers in these regions, which we expect would further increase our number of direct international dealers.\nIn addition, we continue to support and grow the subset of our dealer base that purchase only Pakedge networking solutions, comprising approximately 1,000 active dealers as of December 31, 2016.\nWhile we believe that we will continue to have significant international opportunities, it is difficult to anticipate the exact timing and amount of growth, particularly in new and emerging markets. Such challenges may cause our growth rate to be slower than anticipated, offsetting our efforts to expand into these emerging geographies. Divergent regional and local economic and political trends in Latin America, particularly relating to new home construction and strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus certain local currencies, and the recent vote in the UK to exit the European Union, are examples of challenges we must address in order to continue our international expansion. In response to a weakening Canadian dollar, starting in February 2016, we announced to our dealer network in Canada that we now offer the ability to order and pay for products in Canadian dollars versus U.S. dollars. We believe this offering will help to strengthen our\nlong-term results in Canada while eliminating the margin and quoting uncertainty associated with volatility in foreign exchange rates for our dealers. We saw an increase in Canadian revenue of 13% in 2016 compared to a decrease in Canadian revenue of 7% during 2015.\nNumber of Controllers Sold\nOur controllers contain our proprietary software and provide consumers with the essential technology to enable home control, automation and personalization. The number of controllers we sell in a given period provides us with an indication of consumer adoption of our technology, though a variety of other factors may also impact controller sales variability from period to period. Our sales of controllers also create significant opportunity to sell our other products and services. Once a consumer has deployed our controller, we believe that the consumer is more likely to remain committed to our technology platform and purchase more of our products, applications and services in the future.\nIn January 2016, we introduced a new line of entertainment and automation controllers, the EA Series. With three separate models, our EA Series is designed and priced for projects ranging from a single-room to an entire home or estate. As a result of the launch, we saw a significant increase in controller sales year-over-year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 104,225 controllers, compared to 73,207 and 76,707 controllers sold in the same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Controller sales increased 42% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. This compares to our overall growth in revenue of 28% during the same period.\nCore Revenue Growth\nThe majority of our revenue comes from sales of our products through our distribution channels comprised of independent dealers in the United States and Canada, and independent dealers and distributors located throughout the rest of the world. We refer to revenue attributable to sales through dealers located in the United States and Canada as North America Core revenue, and revenue attributable to sales through dealers and distributors located throughout the rest of the world as International Core revenue. Core revenue does not include revenue from sales to hotels.\nInternational Revenue as a Percentage of Total Revenue\nWe believe that the international market represents a large and underpenetrated opportunity for us. We have established or acquired sales support offices in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, China, and Serbia. We have formed relationships with independent international dealers and distributors, and we have expanded foreign language support for our solutions. We track international revenue as a percentage of total revenue as a key measure of our success in expanding our business internationally.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nThe following is a breakdown of our revenue between North America and International Core revenue and other revenue:\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNorth America Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n162,037 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n123,431 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n111,246 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational Core Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,890 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,275 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,444 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,875 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,473 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,110 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n208,802 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n163,179 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n148,800 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNorth America Core Revenue as a % of Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational Core Revenue as a % of Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015. North America Core revenue increased $38.6 million, or 31%, in 2016 compared to 2015. International Core revenue increased $4.6 million, or 12%, in 2016.\nThe direct sale and fulfillment of networking products is new to our business as of January 29, 2016, when we acquired Pakedge. We generated revenue from the sale of our networking products of $23.2 million during the period from January 29, 2016 to December 31, 2016, respectively, with no similar revenue in 2015. Approximately 85% of these sales are included in North America Core revenue. On a pro forma basis, if we were to assume that the Pakedge transaction had closed at the beginning of 2015, our revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been 15%.\nGrowth in North America Core revenue excluding Pakedge was 15% in 2016 compared to 2015. We saw an increase in the number of dealers and distributors selling our products and services resulting in an increase in the number of system sales, as well as revenue growth from the release of several new products including our EA Series controllers.\nWe continue to make investments internationally to improve our dealers' ability to sell and install our products and believe that these investments will enable us to grow our key international markets. Notwithstanding, we believe that adverse international macro-economic conditions will continue to challenge and slow growth in certain geographies, including Canada and Latin America.\nOther revenue increased $2.4 million, or 97%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily related to sales in the hospitality industry, which is project-based and has been, and will continue to be, uneven from period to period.\n2015 Compared to 2014. North America Core revenue increased $12.2 million, or 11%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Within North America Core revenue, adverse macro-economic conditions, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency in Canada, contributed to a decline of 7% in revenue in Canada in 2015. Excluding Canada, North America Core Revenue grew 14% year over year.\nInternational Core revenue increased $3.8 million, or 11%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in the number of dealers and distributors selling our products and services and the resulting increase in the number of system sales.\nGross Margin\nAs a percentage of revenue, our gross margin has been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors. Our gross margin is relatively consistent across our products. Our gross margin on third-party products that we sell through our online distribution platform is higher than our gross margin on our other product sales because we only recognize our net profit on these sales as revenue. While software licensing and subscription revenue is not material for all periods presented, our gross margin is higher on software licensing and subscription revenue than it is on product sales. Our gross margin is also higher on our sales made directly through dealers than it is on our sales made through distributors. Gross margin may be negatively affected by price competition in our target markets and associated promotional or volume incentive rebates offered to our independent dealers and distributors.\nIn addition, in conjunction with our acquisition of Pakedge and Nexus as well as the direct-to-dealer transition in Australia, we were required to record acquired inventory at fair value, as determined under ASC 805, Business Combinations, resulting in a step-up in the inventory value. Such step-up is recorded through cost of goods sold when the specific inventory is sold, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin. Also, cost of goods sold includes ongoing, periodic amortization of the acquired technology.\nGross margin for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n103,679 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81,534 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n76,357 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015. As a percentage of revenue, our gross margin was relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015. The current year gross margin was negatively impacted by the amortization of the technology acquired from Pakedge and Nexus, the step-up in basis recorded as we sold the purchased inventory in conjunction with our acquisition of Pakedge as well as the direct-to-dealer transition in Australia, and decreases in the selling price of our products in certain foreign markets due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain international currencies. These factors were offset by the expiration of certain royalty payments, component and other product cost reductions as well as product mix and associated pricing.\nThe negative effect on gross margin percentage resulting from the step-up in purchased inventory carrying value was limited to the first and second quarters of 2015 as it relates to Nexus, the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2016 as it relates to the Australia direct-to-dealer transition, and has impacted all four quarters as it relates to Pakedge. The amortization of the acquired technology is expected to occur over the expected life of the acquired technology.\nThe introduction of new products, including the introduction of the EA series of controllers in the first quarter of 2016, generally has a negative impact on gross margins as we offer discounted pricing to our dealers for demo units placed in their showrooms.\nOur sales in Europe, Australia and Canada are generally priced in the pound sterling or the euro, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, respectively, while our cost of goods sold is denominated in U.S. dollars. The changing value of the pound sterling, the euro, and the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the U.S. dollar will continue to contribute to variability in our gross margin for sales in Europe, Australia and Canada.\nThe impact of distribution and other overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue on our gross margin percentage varies depending on total revenue and overhead spending in a given period.\n2015 Compared to 2014. As a percentage of revenue, our gross margin decreased to 50% in 2015 from 51% in 2014. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to amortization of the technology acquired from Nexus as well as the step-up in basis of purchased inventory, decreases in the selling price of our products in certain foreign markets associated with strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain international currencies, enhancements to our volume incentive rebate program resulting in higher volume incentive rebates provided to our dealers, and higher freight charges associated with expedited shipments to our fulfillment centers, offset by component cost reductions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineers and product managers, including non-cash stock compensation expense. Research and development expenses also include prototyping and field-testing expenses incurred in the development of our products. We also include fees paid to agencies to obtain regulatory certifications. Finally, research and development expenses include ongoing, periodic amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n35,985 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,385 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,365 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015. Research and development expenses increased by $3.6 million, or 11%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 included approximately $4.0 million in expenses associated with our new networking products, offset by lower overall spending for our ongoing product development activities.\nOur research and development expenses both as a percentage of revenue and in absolute dollars fluctuate depending on our investments in the development of new solutions. For example, the timing of new hardware releases and the expense associated with prototyping, beta testing and compliance and regulatory fees can have an impact on total research and development expenses from period to period.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Research and development expenses increased by $5.0 million, or 18%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and related expenses, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, to support our ongoing and expanded product development activities. In addition, product development costs, such as prototyping expenses, as well as compliance and regulatory fees contributed to the year over year increase.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related travel expenses for our sales and marketing personnel, including non-cash stock compensation expense. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenses associated with trade shows, marketing events, advertising and other marketing-related programs. We also include the amortization of certain intangible assets such as those related to our dealer network as well as those related to trademarks/trade names.\nSales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n42,198 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,594 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,887 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $9.6 million, or 29%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in absolute dollars for sales and marketing expenses in 2016 included $4.1 million in expenses associated with our new networking products as well as amortization of intangible assets related to the Pakedge acquisition. In addition, we increased our general marketing expenses by $0.7 million to increase lead generation, transition to a direct-to-dealer model in Australia and Germany, grow our dealer and distributor networks throughout the world and deliver tools to the sales channel to support local marketing and sales lead generation. Furthermore, personnel costs increased primarily due to increased sales as well as non-recurring acquisition related restructuring charges.\nWe intend to continue to supplement our more traditional marketing programs with lead generation programs, including social media and pay-per-click advertising, in 2017, resulting in increased spending in sales and marketing. We expect our sales and marketing expenses related to our traditional marketing programs to remain relatively flat in absolute dollars in 2017.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $6.7 million, or 26%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The period over period increases in absolute dollars for sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to sales headcount increases and the related expenses. In addition, we increased our marketing expenses, including an online media campaign, to increase lead generation, grow our dealer and distributor networks throughout the world and deliver tools to the sales channel to support local marketing and sales lead generation.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for our employees in our executive administration, finance, information systems, human resource and legal departments, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Also included in general and administrative expenses are outside legal fees, audit fees, facilities expenses and insurance costs. Finally, during a period with an acquisition, we also include acquisition-related costs in general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,309 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,355 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,195 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015. General and administrative expenses increased by $3.0 million, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in absolute dollars is primarily due to increased personnel costs and other administrative costs associated with running our business, including $0.9 million in non-recurring transition costs associated with the Pakedge integration in 2016.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in absolute dollars in 2017 as a result of growth in the business. However, we also expect our general and administrative expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue in future periods based on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing of those expenses.\n2015 Compared to 2014. General and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million, or 22%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in absolute dollars was due to $1.4 million in acquisition-related expenses associated with the acquisition of Nexus as well as higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense and facilities related costs.\nLitigation Settlement Expenses\nLitigation settlement expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLitigation settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015.

During 2015, we expensed $21,000 in connection with certain legal matters.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) and net interest income (expense). Other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(542) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(563) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(358) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expense remained relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased by $0.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Other expense varies primarily as a result of net foreign currency gains (losses) generated on our U.S. dollar obligations that are carried in local currency by our foreign subsidiaries. This is due to the U.S. dollar fluctuating in value against the pound sterling, euro, and Australian dollar during the periods, causing those U.S. dollar obligations, primarily intercompany payable to the U.S. entity, to increase (decrease) in local currency resulting in increased expense (income).\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2015, we began entering into forward contracts to help offset the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to certain U.S. dollar denominated balance sheet accounts of our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Australia. We settle our foreign exchange contracts on the last day of every month and enter into a new forward contract effective on the first day of the next month. Changes in the fair value (i.e. gains or losses) of these derivative instruments are recorded as other income (expense), net.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,784) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPercentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was approximately -211%, 19% and 5% of income before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% primarily due to the domestic valuation allowance offsetting most of the statutory rate, partial reversal of the valuation allowance due to the deferred tax liability that was recorded as part of the Pakedge acquisition, state income taxes, foreign income taxes, U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and incentive stock options. Cash payments for taxes of $1.1 million in 2016 are primarily related to provisional tax payments paid in Australia and federal alternative minimum tax and state taxes paid in the U.S.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and evaluating our uncertain tax positions. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Due to historical net losses incurred and the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax assets, for all the periods presented, we have a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets. To the extent that we generate positive domestic income and expect, with reasonable certainty, to continue to generate positive income, we may release our valuation allowance in a future period. This release would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period such release is made.\nAcquisition-related costs\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we finalized a plan to restructure certain operations relating to the original Pakedge business. As a result, we incurred approximately $0.5 million in employee termination related expenses during 2016. In addition, we vacated one of the Pakedge facilities during 2016 which resulted in a loss of $0.4 million. We are in the process of marketing the space; however, we will incur additional losses if we are unable to sublease this facility or renegotiate the terms of the lease.\nCompany Matching Contribution to our 401(k) Plan\nThe Company offers a 401(k) Plan and in November of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a matching contribution by the Company starting in 2017. Matching contributions are as follows: the Company will match 100% of the first 1% of salary contributed by a participant, and 50% of the next 5% of salary contributed by a participant, for a maximum of 3.5% matching contribution. Initially, the Company expects to fund its match in contribution with shares of Control4's common stock. The 401(k) Plan was approved starting in 2017, so there was no match or resulting charges in 2016, 2015, or 2014.\nQuarterly Results of Operations and Other Data\nThe following table presents our quarterly consolidated results of operations and other data for each of the quarters presented, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. This quarterly consolidated information has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, the statement of operations data includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods. You should read this table in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future periods.\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

From time to time, however, we may experience fluctuations in our gross margin as a result of the factors discussed in the preceding paragraph.\nOur operating expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on changes in the number of our employees and associated expenses, the timing and magnitude of product development, the timing of marketing and sales expenditures, acquisition of certain intangible assets amortized of the expected life, the timing of non-recurring acquisition-related costs and large or infrequent transactions such as litigation settlement expenses. Our quarterly operating expenses have generally increased in 2016 compared to 2015 to support the growth in our business.\nSales and marketing expenses are typically higher in the first and third quarters of each year due to the timing of our primary trade shows.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPrimary Sources of Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $61.9 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities, a decrease of $19.1 million from December 31, 2015.

As explained above, the increase in inventory was due primarily to the acquisition of Pakedge, buildup of inventory to support direct-to-dealer fulfillment in Australia and new product introductions, including the EA series controllers.\nWe have an asset-based, revolving credit facility of $30.0 million and at December 31, 2016, we had repaid all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. From time to time, we may explore additional financing sources to develop or enhance our product solutions, to fund expansion of our business, to respond to competitive pressures, or to acquire or invest in complementary products, businesses or technologies. We cannot give assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nCash Flow Analysis\nA summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is set forth below (in thousands):\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,530 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,187 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n84,546 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,866 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,414 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,248 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11,697) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,389 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(71,905) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(718) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,575) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,364 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(168) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(66) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,283 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(55,359) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34,813 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,530 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,187 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities of $13.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is due primarily to net income, as adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses for the period, and offset by changes in working capital which included an increase in inventory as described above.\nThe decrease in cash flows from operating activities of $6.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the decrease in net income, increase in inventory of $5.6 million, and growth in accounts receivable of $1.2 million. The increase in inventory is related to build-up of inventory for actual and forecasted revenue growth and for new product releases in January 2016. The increase in accounts receivable is in line with the growth in our business.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities primarily consist of purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities, business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and purchases of property and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities increased to $11.7 million in 2016 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $4.4 million in 2015. The year-over-year change is primarily due to the difference in cash used for business acquisitions, offset by the difference in available-for-sale investment activity. The change in the investment activity was a direct result of the Pakedge acquisition as we primarily used the proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale investments toward the purchase price, rather than reinvesting those funds.\nOur capital expenditures during 2016 and 2015 were $2.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively.\nCash provided by investing activities was $4.4 million in 2015 and increased from 2014 to 2015, which was primarily attributable to fewer net redemptions of marketable securities, associated with the initial investment of our IPO proceeds in early 2014. This decrease was partially offset by the total consideration transferred for Nexus of $8.5 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million, resulting in net cash paid of $8.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of the repurchase of Control4 stock in the open market, repayment of long-term debt, borrowing against our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from the exercise of options to acquire common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 427,646 shares of our stock in the open market for $3.2 million compared to 1,154,480 shares for $9.0 million in the same period in 2015.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2016, we borrowed and repaid $5.0 million under our revolving credit facility.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we received proceeds of $3.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively, from the exercise of options to purchase common stock.\nNet repayments on our term loan agreements were $0.9 million and $0.9 million and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our term loans were repaid in full as of December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet activities. We do not have any off-balance sheet interest in variable interest entities, which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities.\nContractual Obligations\nWe enter into long-term contractual obligations in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancellable operating leases.\nOur contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2016 are as follows:\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,353 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,354 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,788 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,740 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,740 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n41,093 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n38,094 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,788 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with our revenue recognition, inventory valuation reserves, product warranty liability, income taxes and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We discuss, where appropriate, sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur.\nWe have chosen to opt out\u201d of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe sell our products through a network of independent dealers and distributors and not directly to consumers. These dealers and distributors generally sell our products to the consumer as part of a bundled sale, which typically includes other third-party products and related services, project design and installation services and ongoing support.\nWe record estimated reductions to revenue for dealer, retailer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of volume rebates, at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms and our historical experience and trend analysis. The most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to dealers and distributors for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives.\nOur controllers include embedded software that is essential to the functionality of the controller. Accordingly, the hardware and embedded software components are sold together as one product. In 2013, we began bundling Control4 App software licenses with our new controllers. These software licenses do not include acceptance provisions, rights to updates (e.g., when-and-if-available enhancements or upgrades to the functionality of the software) or post-contract customer support such as technical support. When a software license and controller are sold together, a multiple element arrangement exists and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on relative selling prices. Typically, delivery of both the product and the software license occurs at the same time. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product or licensed software is considered delivered once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of our product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.\nSoftware license revenue represents fees earned from activating applications that allow consumers to manage and control their automation systems remotely using tablets, smartphones and other third-party devices. Software products such as Composer Home and Media Editions are sold on a limited basis and do not constitute a significant portion of our revenue. Our perpetual software licenses do not include acceptance provisions, rights to updates or upgrades or post-contract customer support such as technical support. We generally recognize revenue at the time the software license is provided.\nWe offer a subscription service that allows consumers to control and monitor their homes remotely and allows our dealers to perform remote diagnostic services. Subscription revenue is deferred at the time of payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the service is provided.\nWe recognize revenue net of cost of revenue for third-party products sold through our online ordering system. While we assume credit risk on sales to our dealers and distributors, we do not determine the product selling price, do not retain associated inventory risks and are not the primary obligor to the dealer or distributor.\nOur agreements with dealers and distributors generally do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions. Even though contractual agreements do not provide return privileges, there are circumstances in which we will accept returns. In addition, agreements with certain retail distributors contain price protection and limited rights of return. We maintain a reserve for such returns based on our historical return experience.\nShipping charges billed to dealers and distributors are included in product revenue and related shipping costs are included in cost of revenue.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories consist of hardware and related component parts and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. We periodically assess the recoverability of our inventory and reduce the carrying value of the inventory when items are determined to be obsolete, defective or in excess of forecasted sales requirements. Carrying value adjustments are based on expected demand and market conditions. For example, we may incur inventory write-offs during the introduction of new products that replace existing ones. We make estimates regarding transition inventory and if our estimates of demand for the end-of-life\u201d products differ substantially, we may be required to record additional inventory carrying value adjustments.\nInventory write-downs for excess, defective and obsolete inventory are recorded as cost of revenue and totaled $3.1 million, $2.3 million and $1.7 million, and in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nLimited Product Warranties\nWe provide our customers a limited product warranty of two years for all Control4 branded products and three years for all Pakedge branded products. The limited product warranties require us, at our option, to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the customer or refund the purchase price. We estimate the costs that may be incurred to replace, repair or issue a refund for defective products and record a reserve at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the cost of the products sold, our historical experience, and management's judgment regarding anticipated rates of product warranty returns, net of refurbished products. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability each period and make adjustments to the liability as necessary. Our warranty liability was $1.9 million and $1.4 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Due to the net losses incurred and the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax assets, for all the periods presented, we have a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of our domestic operations.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relative tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nWe recognize uncertain income tax positions taken on income tax returns at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.\nOur policy for recording interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of our income tax provision. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not record any material interest income, interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions or the settlement of audits for prior periods.\nBusiness Combinations and Impairment of Long-lived and Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill\nWhen we acquire businesses, we allocate the fair value of the consideration transferred to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Any residual consideration is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the consideration transferred requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on the application of valuation models using historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and our understanding of the future projections. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain, unpredictable, and\nsubject to refinement. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.\nPeriodically we assess potential impairment of our long-lived assets, which include property, equipment, and acquired intangible assets. We perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy, and significant industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset. We amortize intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, or if appropriate, using a method that better represents the pattern of usage.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, and in the interim by reporting unit if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We initially assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform a first step by comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of our single reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. No impairment of long-lived and intangible assets or goodwill was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the respective award.\nThe fair value of each restricted stock unit award is based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nDetermining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to August 2, 2013, the date our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the fair value of common stock was determined by our board of directors, which intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The assumptions we use in the valuation model were based on future expectations combined with management judgment. In the absence of a public trading market, our board of directors, with input from management, exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of the date of each option grant. Since our IPO, we determine the fair value of our common stock based on the closing price as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of our common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpected Volatility. As we do not have an adequate trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average of the historical volatilities of an index fund and industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpected Term. As we do not have an adequate trading history for our common stock, the expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. For our option grants, we used the simplified method to determine the expected term as provided by the SEC. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. We used the simplified method to determine our expected term because of our limited history of stock option exercise activity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we also estimated a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards using historical data.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected terms utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility and expected terms, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the periods presented:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExpected terms (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.3\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRisk-free rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.3\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n1.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n2.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransactions with Our Significant Stockholders\nIn January 2011, we entered into an OEM-in hardware (with software) purchase and license agreement with Cisco Systems, Inc.

Our agreement with Cisco expired in February 2014 and we did not recognize any revenue in connection with this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Our entertainment, smart lighting, comfort and convenience, safety and security, and networking solutions unlock the potential of connected devices, making entertainment systems easier to use and more accessible, homes and businesses more comfortable and energy efficient, and individuals more secure. Our premium smart home and small business solutions provide consumers with the ability to integrate audio, video, lighting, temperature, security, communications, network management and other functionalities into a unified automation solution, customized to match their lifestyles and business needs. Our advanced software, delivered through our controller products, cloud services and user-interface products power this customized experience, enabling cohesive interoperability with thousands of connected Control4 and third-party devices.\nConsumers purchase our smart solutions from our worldwide network of certified independent dealers, regional and national retailers and distributors. These dealers, retailers and distributors design and install customized solutions to fit the specific needs of each consumer, whether it is a one-room home theater set-up or a whole-home automation\nsystem that features the integration of audio, video, lighting, temperature, security, network management and communications devices. Our products are installed in both new and existing residences, multi-dwelling units and small commercial facilities. We refer to revenue from sales of our products through these dealers, retailers and distributors as our Core revenue ( Core revenue\u201d). In addition, a portion of our revenue is attributable to sales in the hospitality industry, primarily related to products installed in hotels, which is excluded from our calculation of Core revenue. Our revenue from sales to hotels is generally project-based and has been significant in some periods and insignificant in other periods. In the future, we expect revenue from hospitality to continue to be project-based and uneven from period to period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, over 3,900 active direct dealers were authorized to sell and install the full Control4 line of products in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and 48 other countries, and partnered with 29 distributors to cover an additional 46 countries where we do not have direct dealer relationships. These distributors sell our solutions through dealers and provide warehousing, training, technical support, and billing for dealers in each of those countries. We also have an additional 1,000 active dealers and 17 distributors that are currently authorized to sell our Pakedge line of products only.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of products that contain our proprietary software, which functions as the operating system of the home. We also generate revenue from the sale of annual subscriptions to our 4Sight subscription service, which allows consumers to remotely access, backup, and control their smart home solutions from their mobile devices; receive e-mail and push notification\u201d alerts regarding activities in their home and enable Amazon Alexa voice services.\nWe were founded in 2003 and began shipping our products and generating revenue in 2005. Our revenue growth rates for the last five complete calendar years are shown in the following table (dollars in millions):\n\nOver the past five years, we have experienced double-digit annual Core revenue growth. Our Core revenue growth during that period has been the result of a combination of both the net addition of new independent dealers and distributors to our sales channels, an increase in revenue from our existing network of independent dealers and distributors, and new products both developed internally and acquired through business combinations. We believe our ability to grow our core sales channel has been enhanced through product innovation, expansion of our product offerings and helping our independent dealers and distributors grow their business and gross margins by providing enhanced dealer installation and marketing tools. Some recent developments that we believe may enhance our offerings and help drive growth include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u00b7 Announced integration with Amazon Alexa, the popular voice service that powers Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices, including Echo Dot, Amazon Tap and Amazon Fire TV. The new Control4 Smart Home Skill provides homeowners with the convenience of whole-home automation through simple and intuitive voice commands that can activate smart home scenes and control individual devices; \n \u00b7 Released Control4 OS 2.9, featuring increased integration support for third party devices, more personalization for the homeowner, and new customization options for our dealers; \n \u00b7 Released Bakpak 4.1, the intelligent cloud-based management system for dealers, enabling rapid response to connectivity issues, proactive device management, and greater visibility of networks and automation systems within connected homes across a dealer's entire customer base; \n \u00b7 Announced and began selling a new line of intelligent Square Wireless Lighting products, expanding custom and retrofit lighting opportunities for our dealers in Europe and Asia; and \n \u00b7 Rolled out a new line of entertainment and automation controllers, the EA Series, featuring high-resolution audio, high-performance automation, and our broad interoperability, in January 2016. With three separate models, the Control4 EA Series is designed and priced to deliver exceptional automation power, reliability, and high-impact entertainment experiences for projects ranging from a single-room to an entire home or estate. \nWhile our historical revenue growth has been primarily organic, we have completed several acquisitions since our IPO that we believe enhance our product offerings and position us for continued growth in the future. Recent acquisitions of technology and distribution-related business are as follows:\n \u00b7 In April 2016, we transitioned from a two-tier distribution model to direct-to-dealer in Australia, and as part of this process, acquired customer lists and inventory of the former distributor; \n \u00b7 In January 2016, we acquired Pakedge, a developer and manufacturer of networking products, power distribution and management solutions, as well as cloud network-managed services for both wireless and wired networking solutions in the connected home and business. Pakedge's portfolio includes wired products such as switches and routers, wireless products such as access points, as well as power management and cloud-based network management technologies. Pakedge brings to Control4 deep networking expertise, innovative technologies, and a sophisticated suite of newly refreshed networking products and rich software capability; and, \n \u00b7 In January 2015, we acquired Nexus, a developer and manufacturer of the Leaf brand of custom audio/video distribution and switching systems. We previously sold certain Leaf products under our Control4 brand and through our online ordering platform. After this acquisition, we began offering a complete line of video distribution solutions under the Control4 brand to Control4 customers worldwide, we gained market share in the growing audio and video (A/V) category, and we leveraged Nexus's valuable engineering expertise to develop new and innovative A/V solutions. \nWe plan to continue to identify, acquire and integrate strategic technologies, assets and businesses that we believe will enhance the overall strength of our business, allow us to streamline sales, technical support and training, and enhance our dealers' ability to grow their businesses.\nHistorically, we have experienced seasonal variations in our revenue as a result of holiday-related factors that are common in our industry. Our revenue is generally highest in the fourth quarter due to consumers' desires to complete their home installations prior to the holiday season. We generally see decreased sales in the first quarter due to seasonal purchase tendencies of consumers as well as the impact of winter weather on new construction and travel in certain geographies. In addition, our year-over-year revenue growth on a quarterly basis is not always linear for a variety of reasons including: the timing of new product releases, the use of marketing programs to accelerate intra-quarter sales of certain products or product families, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and the impact of general regional economic conditions on consumer buying decisions and harsh weather that delayed or canceled building projects. We generally expect these seasonal and other trends to continue in the future, which may cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations and certain financial metrics.\nFactors and Trends Affecting Our Performance\nA number of industry trends have facilitated our growth over the past several years, including the proliferation of connected devices and the constant growth of network-enabled homes and businesses. From smartphones to smart\nwatches to smart cars, technology is transforming nearly every aspect of our lives, streamlining daily routines and providing quick, easy access to the capabilities and content we want most. Not only are new technologies providing convenience on-the-go, but they are becoming increasingly accessible. Voice services is a recent example of an emerging technology in our connected world, and our integration with Amazon Alexa helps keep us at the forefront of our industry in our adoption of voice activated solutions. We remain committed to embracing emerging technologies through our open platform and broad ecosystem.\nOur open platform makes it easy for a broad community of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners to participate in our smart home ecosystem, which includes over 10,100 drivers and more than 2,000 SDDP-enabled products. Our broad ecosystem, which includes audio, video, lighting, temperature, network, security and communication device categories, gives consumers flexibility to integrate nearly any connectable device into their smart home. In addition, our partners are constantly contributing new device integrations. As such, our dynamic ecosystem remains current with the latest product innovations and allows our smart home platform to grow alongside emerging technologies to meet our consumers' changing needs and preferences. We believe that our open platform and the resulting ecosystem is a key competitive advantage that will continue to facilitate our growth.\nOur products leverage both wired and wireless technologies and are designed to be installed in both new construction and existing homes. We expect that future increases in both new home construction and existing home renovations will have a positive impact on our revenue. In new home construction, we continue to engage builders to introduce entry- to mid-level Control4 systems as a standard feature in new home projects. We believe home automation is increasingly becoming a higher priority for home buyers, and this is one of the reasons for our investment in national and regional builder programs.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including the rates at which consumers adopt our products and services, our commitment to growing the awareness of our brands, our ability to optimize and expand our dealer and distributor network, our ability to expand internationally, our ability to meet competitive challenges, and our ability to respond to worldwide economic events. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain or expand the growth of our business and improve our results of operations. These challenges include:\n \u00b7 Increasing Adoption Rates of Our Products and Services. We are focused on increasing adoption rates of our products and services through enhancements to our software platform and product offerings. We intend to accomplish these enhancements through both continued investments in research and development activities and acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies. \n \u00b7 Growing Our Leadership Position in the Industry. We are committed to growing awareness of the Control4 and Pakedge brands among our dealers, distributors and partners. We believe that our investments in creating brand awareness in the industry has contributed to dealer recruitment, product adoption, and revenue growth. We are proud of the many awards we received from various industry groups and dealer consortiums, formally recognizing our commitment to excellence. In September 2016, we received two Best of Show\u201d Awards at the Custom Electronics Design and Installation Association ( CEDIA\u201d) 2016 for Control4 Amazon Alexa Smart Home and our NK-1 Wireless Controller + Bakpak. CEDIA 2016 also awarded us the Technology Integrator Impact!\u201d Award for our EA Series controllers. In June 2016, Control4 was named as the top Whole-Home Automation brand, and Pakedge was named the top networking brand, by the 2016 CE Pro 100 Brand Analysis\u201d report. This is the second year in a row that Control4 was recognized as the top Whole-Home Automation brand, and the fourth year in a row that Pakedge has been named the top brand for home networking. In addition, Control4 solutions were recognized as the top brand in the categories of whole-house audio/video, access control, and HVAC/thermostats; and among the leading brands in the categories of lighting control, remote controls, and communications (phones/intercoms). Finally, in May 2016, the ProSource Buying Group named Control4 the 2016 Custom Integration Vendor of the Year. \n \u00b7 Accelerating and Enhancing Consumer Lead Generation. We determined that there is an opportunity for us to play a more active role in generating and following up on leads received from our marketing efforts. \n Therefore, we are continuing to invest in inside sales representatives to qualify inbound inquiries and direct them to qualified independent dealers. Our enhanced lead generation strategies have increased consultations, bids and project installations. Through the continual optimization of our marketing efforts, coupled with our new inside resources to qualify inbound leads, we have improved lead conversion rates and increased the amount of revenue per lead. \n \u00b7 Optimizing and Expanding Our North America Dealer Network. We intend to continue to optimize the performance of and expand our network of dealers in North America to ensure that we have geographic coverage and technical expertise to address our existing markets and new markets into which we plan to expand. We continue to work with all appropriately qualified dealers to explore both home control and networking product lines, and we continue to cross-train and cross-certify dealers in accordance with our existing standards of technical proficiency and business practices. Furthermore, we have expanded the existing training facilities in Salt Lake City, UT and Chicago, IL, to meet the growing demand by Control4 dealers. \n \u00b7 Expanding our International Dealer and Distributor Network. We believe that our future growth will depend in part on our ability to expand our dealer and distributor network outside of North America, to adapt our products and services to foreign markets, and to increase our brand awareness internationally. We continue to add field sales and service personnel to assist in the optimization of our international channels. We have transitioned to a direct-to-dealer model in specific international regions, namely in the United Kingdom, China, India, Germany and Australia, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities in other countries. Furthermore, we have opened new international training centers in Germany and Australia to help support the transition to a direct-to-dealer model. \n \u00b7 Managing Competition. The market for home automation is fragmented, highly competitive and continually evolving. In addition to competing with traditional players in the luxury segment of the home automation market, including Savant, Crestron and Elan, a number of large technology companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Samsung offer device control capabilities within some of their own products, applications and services, and are engaged in ongoing efforts to address the broader home automation market. In addition, managed service companies such as ADT, Comcast, and Vivint, have broadened their service offerings to include control of devices such as door locks, lights, and cameras. Our ability to compete in the growing home automation market over the next several years will be a key factor in our ability to continue to grow our business and meet or exceed our future expectations. \n \u00b7 Impact of the United Kingdom's Vote to Leave the European Union. On June 23, 2016, the citizens of the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d) voted to leave ( Brexit\u201d) the European Union ( EU\u201d) raising concerns of a potential slowdown in the UK's economy specifically and the EU in general. We engaged with our dealers in the UK to assess their perception of how the Brexit vote might impact their business in the near and long-term. Their responses are varied and reflect the uncertainty that currently exists in the market. We will continue to monitor the risks and uncertainties throughout what is expected to be a lengthy process. The Brexit vote had the immediate impact of devaluing the pound sterling relative to the euro and the U.S. dollar. In Europe, we generally sell our products and incur expense in local currencies including the pound sterling and the euro, but incur exchange rate gains and losses for U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities including intercompany and third-party accounts receivables and payables. We enter into forward contracts to help offset our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to these types of U.S. dollar denominated balances. When consolidating the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries, we translate local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates during the period, resulting in either higher or lower net income depending on changes in the relative value of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. Brexit is not expected to have a material impact on our future consolidated net income. \nAcquisition of Pakedge\nIn January 2016, we acquired Pakedge, a developer and manufacturer of networking products, power distribution and management solutions, as well as cloud network-managed services for both wireless and wired networking solutions in the connected home and business. As of September 30, 2016, the integration of Pakedge was complete, which included the consolidation of the warehousing and shipping of products, ERP system, web portal, and training facilities.\nLike Control4, Pakedge conducts its business through a broad channel of independent dealers, of which, only one-third were certified dealers of the entire Control4 product line at the time of acquisition. We expect to grow Pakedge product sales through our network of more than 3,900 active, certified Control4 dealers. From the date of acquisition in January 2016 through December 2016, over 1,500 additional certified Control4 dealers have started purchasing and begun selling Pakedge networking products, generating revenue of approximately $8.3 million.\nWe intend to grow both the Pakedge product business and the Control4 product business through our combined dealer channel of over 4,900 total active dealers. We believe Pakedge provides a significant boost to our development capabilities, our solution portfolio, and business flexibility moving forward. For the year-ended December 31, 2016, Pakedge was accretive to our growth, while contributing positively to our net income for the year.\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics\nWe use the following key operating and financial metrics to evaluate and manage our business.\nNorth America Direct Dealers(1)\n\nInternational Direct Dealers(1)\n\n\n (1) These dealer figures only include dealers authorized to sell and install the full Control4 line of products and exclude the dealers that are currently authorized to sell only the Pakedge line of products, which as of December 31, 2016 totals approximately 1,000 dealers and 17 distributors. \n (2) An active dealer\u201d is an authorized dealer that has placed an order with us in the trailing 12-month period. \n (3) The figures for year ended December 31, 2016, include 100 dealers that were acquired as part of the direct-to-dealer transition in Australia. \nNumber of North America and Direct International Dealers\nBecause our dealers promote, sell, install and support our products, a broader dealer network allows us to reach more potential consumers across more geographic regions. We expect our dealer network to continue to grow, both in North America and internationally. While we have historically focused on dealers affiliated with CEDIA, we believe there is an opportunity to establish relationships with dealers outside of CEDIA, including non-traditional A/V dealers, electrical contractors, and security system installers.\nWe continue to invest in tools and technologies to help our dealers be more successful and increase the year-over-year sales of our products. Our goal is to continuously increase our dealers' productivity and growth. Enabling our dealers to increase productivity will ultimately drive our revenue growth.\nAs part of our normal process for developing a productive, capable dealer network, we regularly review individual dealer performance and as necessary, terminate dealer agreements where volume, technical training and performance requirements are not being fulfilled. We view this as a healthy part of growing our customer install direct dealer channel worldwide. We continue to add new dealers, expanding both our North America and international direct dealer networks.\nAs a result of our traditional efforts to expand our channel, the number of active international dealers increased 29% and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, compared to an increase of 6% and 6% respectively, in the number of active North American direct dealers during the same periods. Generally, the growth percentage internationally is higher because our presence in these markets is less mature and our base of dealers is much lower than the North American market. Much of this growth in our international dealer network is attributed to new dealer additions in China, Germany and Australia. In April 2016, we started selling direct-to-dealers in the Australian market immediately adding 100 new active international dealers. We plan to continue to monitor other markets that are currently served by a single distributor and, when business conditions are favorable, we may decide to establish direct relationships with selected dealers in these regions, which we expect would further increase our number of direct international dealers.\nIn addition, we continue to support and grow the subset of our dealer base that purchase only Pakedge networking solutions, comprising approximately 1,000 active dealers as of December 31, 2016.\nWhile we believe that we will continue to have significant international opportunities, it is difficult to anticipate the exact timing and amount of growth, particularly in new and emerging markets. Such challenges may cause our growth rate to be slower than anticipated, offsetting our efforts to expand into these emerging geographies. Divergent regional and local economic and political trends in Latin America, particularly relating to new home construction and strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus certain local currencies, and the recent vote in the UK to exit the European Union, are examples of challenges we must address in order to continue our international expansion. In response to a weakening Canadian dollar, starting in February 2016, we announced to our dealer network in Canada that we now offer the ability to order and pay for products in Canadian dollars versus U.S. dollars. We believe this offering will help to strengthen our\nlong-term results in Canada while eliminating the margin and quoting uncertainty associated with volatility in foreign exchange rates for our dealers. We saw an increase in Canadian revenue of 13% in 2016 compared to a decrease in Canadian revenue of 7% during 2015.\nNumber of Controllers Sold\nOur controllers contain our proprietary software and provide consumers with the essential technology to enable home control, automation and personalization. The number of controllers we sell in a given period provides us with an indication of consumer adoption of our technology, though a variety of other factors may also impact controller sales variability from period to period. Our sales of controllers also create significant opportunity to sell our other products and services. Once a consumer has deployed our controller, we believe that the consumer is more likely to remain committed to our technology platform and purchase more of our products, applications and services in the future.\nIn January 2016, we introduced a new line of entertainment and automation controllers, the EA Series. With three separate models, our EA Series is designed and priced for projects ranging from a single-room to an entire home or estate. As a result of the launch, we saw a significant increase in controller sales year-over-year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 104,225 controllers, compared to 73,207 and 76,707 controllers sold in the same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Controller sales increased 42% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Our entertainment, smart lighting, comfort and convenience, safety and security, and networking solutions unlock the potential of connected devices, making entertainment systems easier to use and more accessible, homes and businesses more comfortable and energy efficient, and individuals more secure. Our premium smart home and small business solutions provide consumers with the ability to integrate audio, video, lighting, temperature, security, communications, network management and other functionalities into a unified automation solution, customized to match their lifestyles and business needs. Our advanced software, delivered through our controller products, cloud services and user-interface products power this customized experience, enabling cohesive interoperability with thousands of connected Control4 and third-party devices.\nConsumers purchase our smart solutions from our worldwide network of certified independent dealers, regional and national retailers and distributors. These dealers, retailers and distributors design and install customized solutions to fit the specific needs of each consumer, whether it is a one-room home theater set-up or a whole-home automation\nsystem that features the integration of audio, video, lighting, temperature, security, network management and communications devices. Our products are installed in both new and existing residences, multi-dwelling units and small commercial facilities. We refer to revenue from sales of our products through these dealers, retailers and distributors as our Core revenue ( Core revenue\u201d). In addition, a portion of our revenue is attributable to sales in the hospitality industry, primarily related to products installed in hotels, which is excluded from our calculation of Core revenue. Our revenue from sales to hotels is generally project-based and has been significant in some periods and insignificant in other periods. In the future, we expect revenue from hospitality to continue to be project-based and uneven from period to period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, over 3,900 active direct dealers were authorized to sell and install the full Control4 line of products in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and 48 other countries, and partnered with 29 distributors to cover an additional 46 countries where we do not have direct dealer relationships. These distributors sell our solutions through dealers and provide warehousing, training, technical support, and billing for dealers in each of those countries. We also have an additional 1,000 active dealers and 17 distributors that are currently authorized to sell our Pakedge line of products only.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of products that contain our proprietary software, which functions as the operating system of the home. We also generate revenue from the sale of annual subscriptions to our 4Sight subscription service, which allows consumers to remotely access, backup, and control their smart home solutions from their mobile devices; receive e-mail and push notification\u201d alerts regarding activities in their home and enable Amazon Alexa voice services.\nWe were founded in 2003 and began shipping our products and generating revenue in 2005. Our revenue growth rates for the last five complete calendar years are shown in the following table (dollars in millions):\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n203.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n160.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n144.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n126.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n105.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCore revenue growth over prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther revenue changes over prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n208.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n163.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n148.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n128.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n109.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue growth over prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOver the past five years, we have experienced double-digit annual Core revenue growth. Our Core revenue growth during that period has been the result of a combination of both the net addition of new independent dealers and distributors to our sales channels, an increase in revenue from our existing network of independent dealers and distributors, and new products both developed internally and acquired through business combinations. We believe our ability to grow our core sales channel has been enhanced through product innovation, expansion of our product offerings and helping our independent dealers and distributors grow their business and gross margins by providing enhanced dealer installation and marketing tools. Some recent developments that we believe may enhance our offerings and help drive growth include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u00b7 Announced integration with Amazon Alexa, the popular voice service that powers Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices, including Echo Dot, Amazon Tap and Amazon Fire TV. The new Control4 Smart Home Skill provides homeowners with the convenience of whole-home automation through simple and intuitive voice commands that can activate smart home scenes and control individual devices; \n \u00b7 Released Control4 OS 2.9, featuring increased integration support for third party devices, more personalization for the homeowner, and new customization options for our dealers; \n \u00b7 Released Bakpak 4.1, the intelligent cloud-based management system for dealers, enabling rapid response to connectivity issues, proactive device management, and greater visibility of networks and automation systems within connected homes across a dealer's entire customer base; \n \u00b7 Announced and began selling a new line of intelligent Square Wireless Lighting products, expanding custom and retrofit lighting opportunities for our dealers in Europe and Asia; and \n \u00b7 Rolled out a new line of entertainment and automation controllers, the EA Series, featuring high-resolution audio, high-performance automation, and our broad interoperability, in January 2016. With three separate models, the Control4 EA Series is designed and priced to deliver exceptional automation power, reliability, and high-impact entertainment experiences for projects ranging from a single-room to an entire home or estate. \nWhile our historical revenue growth has been primarily organic, we have completed several acquisitions since our IPO that we believe enhance our product offerings and position us for continued growth in the future. Recent acquisitions of technology and distribution-related business are as follows:\n \u00b7 In April 2016, we transitioned from a two-tier distribution model to direct-to-dealer in Australia, and as part of this process, acquired customer lists and inventory of the former distributor; \n \u00b7 In January 2016, we acquired Pakedge, a developer and manufacturer of networking products, power distribution and management solutions, as well as cloud network-managed services for both wireless and wired networking solutions in the connected home and business. Pakedge's portfolio includes wired products such as switches and routers, wireless products such as access points, as well as power management and cloud-based network management technologies. Pakedge brings to Control4 deep networking expertise, innovative technologies, and a sophisticated suite of newly refreshed networking products and rich software capability; and, \n \u00b7 In January 2015, we acquired Nexus, a developer and manufacturer of the Leaf brand of custom audio/video distribution and switching systems. We previously sold certain Leaf products under our Control4 brand and through our online ordering platform. After this acquisition, we began offering a complete line of video distribution solutions under the Control4 brand to Control4 customers worldwide, we gained market share in the growing audio and video (A/V) category, and we leveraged Nexus's valuable engineering expertise to develop new and innovative A/V solutions. \nWe plan to continue to identify, acquire and integrate strategic technologies, assets and businesses that we believe will enhance the overall strength of our business, allow us to streamline sales, technical support and training, and enhance our dealers' ability to grow their businesses.\nHistorically, we have experienced seasonal variations in our revenue as a result of holiday-related factors that are common in our industry. Our revenue is generally highest in the fourth quarter due to consumers' desires to complete their home installations prior to the holiday season. We generally see decreased sales in the first quarter due to seasonal purchase tendencies of consumers as well as the impact of winter weather on new construction and travel in certain geographies. In addition, our year-over-year revenue growth on a quarterly basis is not always linear for a variety of reasons including: the timing of new product releases, the use of marketing programs to accelerate intra-quarter sales of certain products or product families, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and the impact of general regional economic conditions on consumer buying decisions and harsh weather that delayed or canceled building projects. We generally expect these seasonal and other trends to continue in the future, which may cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations and certain financial metrics.\nFactors and Trends Affecting Our Performance\nA number of industry trends have facilitated our growth over the past several years, including the proliferation of connected devices and the constant growth of network-enabled homes and businesses. From smartphones to smart\nwatches to smart cars, technology is transforming nearly every aspect of our lives, streamlining daily routines and providing quick, easy access to the capabilities and content we want most. Not only are new technologies providing convenience on-the-go, but they are becoming increasingly accessible. Voice services is a recent example of an emerging technology in our connected world, and our integration with Amazon Alexa helps keep us at the forefront of our industry in our adoption of voice activated solutions. We remain committed to embracing emerging technologies through our open platform and broad ecosystem.\nOur open platform makes it easy for a broad community of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners to participate in our smart home ecosystem, which includes over 10,100 drivers and more than 2,000 SDDP-enabled products. Our broad ecosystem, which includes audio, video, lighting, temperature, network, security and communication device categories, gives consumers flexibility to integrate nearly any connectable device into their smart home. In addition, our partners are constantly contributing new device integrations. As such, our dynamic ecosystem remains current with the latest product innovations and allows our smart home platform to grow alongside emerging technologies to meet our consumers' changing needs and preferences. We believe that our open platform and the resulting ecosystem is a key competitive advantage that will continue to facilitate our growth.\nOur products leverage both wired and wireless technologies and are designed to be installed in both new construction and existing homes. We expect that future increases in both new home construction and existing home renovations will have a positive impact on our revenue. In new home construction, we continue to engage builders to introduce entry- to mid-level Control4 systems as a standard feature in new home projects. We believe home automation is increasingly becoming a higher priority for home buyers, and this is one of the reasons for our investment in national and regional builder programs.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including the rates at which consumers adopt our products and services, our commitment to growing the awareness of our brands, our ability to optimize and expand our dealer and distributor network, our ability to expand internationally, our ability to meet competitive challenges, and our ability to respond to worldwide economic events. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain or expand the growth of our business and improve our results of operations. These challenges include:\n \u00b7 Increasing Adoption Rates of Our Products and Services. We are focused on increasing adoption rates of our products and services through enhancements to our software platform and product offerings. We intend to accomplish these enhancements through both continued investments in research and development activities and acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies. \n \u00b7 Growing Our Leadership Position in the Industry. We are committed to growing awareness of the Control4 and Pakedge brands among our dealers, distributors and partners. We believe that our investments in creating brand awareness in the industry has contributed to dealer recruitment, product adoption, and revenue growth. We are proud of the many awards we received from various industry groups and dealer consortiums, formally recognizing our commitment to excellence. In September 2016, we received two Best of Show\u201d Awards at the Custom Electronics Design and Installation Association ( CEDIA\u201d) 2016 for Control4 Amazon Alexa Smart Home and our NK-1 Wireless Controller + Bakpak. CEDIA 2016 also awarded us the Technology Integrator Impact!\u201d Award for our EA Series controllers. In June 2016, Control4 was named as the top Whole-Home Automation brand, and Pakedge was named the top networking brand, by the 2016 CE Pro 100 Brand Analysis\u201d report. This is the second year in a row that Control4 was recognized as the top Whole-Home Automation brand, and the fourth year in a row that Pakedge has been named the top brand for home networking. In addition, Control4 solutions were recognized as the top brand in the categories of whole-house audio/video, access control, and HVAC/thermostats; and among the leading brands in the categories of lighting control, remote controls, and communications (phones/intercoms). Finally, in May 2016, the ProSource Buying Group named Control4 the 2016 Custom Integration Vendor of the Year. \n \u00b7 Accelerating and Enhancing Consumer Lead Generation. We determined that there is an opportunity for us to play a more active role in generating and following up on leads received from our marketing efforts. \n Therefore, we are continuing to invest in inside sales representatives to qualify inbound inquiries and direct them to qualified independent dealers. Our enhanced lead generation strategies have increased consultations, bids and project installations. Through the continual optimization of our marketing efforts, coupled with our new inside resources to qualify inbound leads, we have improved lead conversion rates and increased the amount of revenue per lead. \n \u00b7 Optimizing and Expanding Our North America Dealer Network. We intend to continue to optimize the performance of and expand our network of dealers in North America to ensure that we have geographic coverage and technical expertise to address our existing markets and new markets into which we plan to expand. We continue to work with all appropriately qualified dealers to explore both home control and networking product lines, and we continue to cross-train and cross-certify dealers in accordance with our existing standards of technical proficiency and business practices. Furthermore, we have expanded the existing training facilities in Salt Lake City, UT and Chicago, IL, to meet the growing demand by Control4 dealers. \n \u00b7 Expanding our International Dealer and Distributor Network. We believe that our future growth will depend in part on our ability to expand our dealer and distributor network outside of North America, to adapt our products and services to foreign markets, and to increase our brand awareness internationally. We continue to add field sales and service personnel to assist in the optimization of our international channels. We have transitioned to a direct-to-dealer model in specific international regions, namely in the United Kingdom, China, India, Germany and Australia, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities in other countries. Furthermore, we have opened new international training centers in Germany and Australia to help support the transition to a direct-to-dealer model. \n \u00b7 Managing Competition. The market for home automation is fragmented, highly competitive and continually evolving. In addition to competing with traditional players in the luxury segment of the home automation market, including Savant, Crestron and Elan, a number of large technology companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Samsung offer device control capabilities within some of their own products, applications and services, and are engaged in ongoing efforts to address the broader home automation market. In addition, managed service companies such as ADT, Comcast, and Vivint, have broadened their service offerings to include control of devices such as door locks, lights, and cameras. Our ability to compete in the growing home automation market over the next several years will be a key factor in our ability to continue to grow our business and meet or exceed our future expectations. \n \u00b7 Impact of the United Kingdom's Vote to Leave the European Union. On June 23, 2016, the citizens of the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d) voted to leave ( Brexit\u201d) the European Union ( EU\u201d) raising concerns of a potential slowdown in the UK's economy specifically and the EU in general. We engaged with our dealers in the UK to assess their perception of how the Brexit vote might impact their business in the near and long-term. Their responses are varied and reflect the uncertainty that currently exists in the market. We will continue to monitor the risks and uncertainties throughout what is expected to be a lengthy process. The Brexit vote had the immediate impact of devaluing the pound sterling relative to the euro and the U.S. dollar. In Europe, we generally sell our products and incur expense in local currencies including the pound sterling and the euro, but incur exchange rate gains and losses for U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities including intercompany and third-party accounts receivables and payables. We enter into forward contracts to help offset our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to these types of U.S. dollar denominated balances. When consolidating the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries, we translate local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates during the period, resulting in either higher or lower net income depending on changes in the relative value of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. Brexit is not expected to have a material impact on our future consolidated net income. \nAcquisition of Pakedge\nIn January 2016, we acquired Pakedge, a developer and manufacturer of networking products, power distribution and management solutions, as well as cloud network-managed services for both wireless and wired networking solutions in the connected home and business. As of September 30, 2016, the integration of Pakedge was complete, which included the consolidation of the warehousing and shipping of products, ERP system, web portal, and training facilities.\nLike Control4, Pakedge conducts its business through a broad channel of independent dealers, of which, only one-third were certified dealers of the entire Control4 product line at the time of acquisition. We expect to grow Pakedge product sales through our network of more than 3,900 active, certified Control4 dealers. From the date of acquisition in January 2016 through December 2016, over 1,500 additional certified Control4 dealers have started purchasing and begun selling Pakedge networking products, generating revenue of approximately $8.3 million.\nWe intend to grow both the Pakedge product business and the Control4 product business through our combined dealer channel of over 4,900 total active dealers. We believe Pakedge provides a significant boost to our development capabilities, our solution portfolio, and business flexibility moving forward. For the year-ended December 31, 2016, Pakedge was accretive to our growth, while contributing positively to our net income for the year.\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics\nWe use the following key

only include dealers authorized to sell and install the full Control4 line of products and exclude the dealers that are currently authorized to sell only the Pakedge line of products, which as of December 31, 2016 totals approximately 1,000 dealers and 17 distributors. \n (2) An active dealer\u201d is an authorized dealer that has placed an order with us in the trailing 12-month period. \n (3) The figures for year ended December 31, 2016, include 100 dealers that were acquired as part of the direct-to-dealer transition in Australia. \nNumber of North America and Direct International Dealers\nBecause our dealers promote, sell, install and support our products, a broader dealer network allows us to reach more potential consumers across more geographic regions. We expect our dealer network to continue to grow, both in North America and internationally. While we have historically focused on dealers affiliated with CEDIA, we believe there is an opportunity to establish relationships with dealers outside of CEDIA, including non-traditional A/V dealers, electrical contractors, and security system installers.\nWe continue to invest in tools and technologies to help our dealers be more successful and increase the year-over-year sales of our products. Our goal is to continuously increase our dealers' productivity and growth. Enabling our dealers to increase productivity will ultimately drive our revenue growth.\nAs part of our normal process for developing a productive, capable dealer network, we regularly review individual dealer performance and as necessary, terminate dealer agreements where volume, technical training and performance requirements are not being fulfilled. We view this as a healthy part of growing our customer install direct dealer channel worldwide. We continue to add new dealers, expanding both our North America and international direct dealer networks.\nAs a result of our traditional efforts to expand our channel, the number of active international dealers increased 29% and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, compared to an increase of 6% and 6% respectively, in the number of active North American direct dealers during the same periods. Generally, the growth percentage internationally is higher because our presence in these markets is less mature and our base of dealers is much lower than the North American market. Much of this growth in our international dealer network is attributed to new dealer additions in China, Germany and Australia. In April 2016, we started selling direct-to-dealers in the Australian market immediately adding 100 new active international dealers. We plan to continue to monitor other markets that are currently served by a single distributor and, when business conditions are favorable, we may decide to establish direct relationships with selected dealers in these regions, which we expect would further increase our number of direct international dealers.\nIn addition, we continue to support and grow the subset of our dealer base that purchase only Pakedge networking solutions, comprising approximately 1,000 active dealers as of December 31, 2016.\nWhile we believe that we will continue to have significant international opportunities, it is difficult to anticipate the exact timing and amount of growth, particularly in new and emerging markets. Such challenges may cause our growth rate to be slower than anticipated, offsetting our efforts to expand into these emerging geographies. Divergent regional and local economic and political trends in Latin America, particularly relating to new home construction and strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus certain local currencies, and the recent vote in the UK to exit the European Union, are examples of challenges we must address in order to continue our international expansion. In response to a weakening Canadian dollar, starting in February 2016, we announced to our dealer network in Canada that we now offer the ability to order and pay for products in Canadian dollars versus U.S. dollars. We believe this offering will help to strengthen our\nlong-term results in Canada while eliminating the margin and quoting uncertainty associated with volatility in foreign exchange rates for our dealers. We saw an increase in Canadian revenue of 13% in 2016 compared to a decrease in Canadian revenue of 7% during 2015.\nNumber of Controllers Sold\nOur controllers contain our proprietary software and provide consumers with the essential technology to enable home control, automation and personalization. The number of controllers we sell in a given period provides us with an indication of consumer adoption of our technology, though a variety of other factors may also impact controller sales variability from period to period. Our sales of controllers also create significant opportunity to sell our other products and services. Once a consumer has deployed our controller, we believe that the consumer is more likely to remain committed to our technology platform and purchase more of our products, applications and services in the future.\nIn January 2016, we introduced a new line of entertainment and automation controllers, the EA Series. With three separate models, our EA Series is designed and priced for projects ranging from a single-room to an entire home or estate. As a result of the launch, we saw a significant increase in controller sales year-over-year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 104,225 controllers, compared to 73,207 and 76,707 controllers sold in the same periods in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Controller sales increased 42% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015."}
