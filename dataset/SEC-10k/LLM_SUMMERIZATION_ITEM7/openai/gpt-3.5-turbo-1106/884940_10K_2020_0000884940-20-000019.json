MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements in light of new information, future events or otherwise. Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.\nOverview\nWe are a national specialty omnichannel off-price retailer offering designer and name-brand fashion apparel, home d\u00e9cor, accessories and shoes at everyday discount prices.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nIn response to the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic, on March 18, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores through March 31, 2020. On March 31, 2020, based on guidance from federal, state and local government and health authorities, and in the interest of the health and safety of our customers and associates, we extended the temporary closure of all stores beyond the previously announced March 31 date. We started reopening stores on April 23, 2020 as government jurisdictions have allowed, and as of the date of this filing, we have reopened substantially all of our stores with limited operating hours. We have implemented significant actions to mitigate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flow to protect our business and associates for the long term. These actions include furloughing most store associates and a significant number of associates in our supply chain network and corporate offices. In addition, we have temporarily reduced the salaries of our executive management by 20 percent and associates not furloughed by a lower rate, and the Board of Directors has suspended its compensation. We have also been working with vendors and landlords to negotiate temporary terms and have utilized funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility and Third Promissory Note (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included in Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further discussion).\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent temporary store closures, our revenues, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to pay vendors and landlords according to standard terms have been materially adversely impacted. Accordingly, our management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. Although having a going concern note in our financial statements is an Event of default under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, we have obtained waivers of such defaults as described in further detail in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included in Item 7 below. We are actively negotiating with vendors and landlords regarding restructuring payment of unpaid accounts payable and rent, but there is no assurance those discussions will be successful. We are also actively exploring additional sources of financing to provide us with additional liquidity and other strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company. However, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nAs stores have reopened, the traffic at our stores has steadily increased, but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Although omnichannel sales have remained strong, they have not compensated for the loss of in-store sales. Sales continue to recover as our stores reopen, but remain well below last year.\n2019 Strategic Priorities\nEvolving Product Mix\nWe are continually evolving our product mix so that it is more relevant to a broader base of customers. We do this by focusing on our off-price characteristics of buying more in-season and opportunistically and consistently adding categories, brands, trends and newness to increase productivity and regular-priced selling. During fall 2019, we launched our new Kids department in all stores and fine jewelry in 50-plus stores.\nExpanding Omnichannel Capabilities\nWe continue to develop our online content and capabilities to more fully integrate our online business with our stores to provide our customers with an enhanced omnichannel experience. During 2019, Omnichannel sales grew 11 percent as a result of several initiatives. We became the first off-price retailer to roll out a buy online, pick up in store service ( BOPIS\u201d) to drive store traffic and create incremental attachment sales. Our ship-from-store program continues to drive volume and improve inventory productivity. In 2019, we added smart fulfillment logic to identify the best location to fill online orders, shorten delivery times and reduce shipping and fulfillment costs. In our stores, we added \"endless aisle\" mobile technology to assist customers in locating product across the enterprise and then placing an online order. We also expanded our product offerings with more drop shipments from vendors and improved our mobile capabilities. These initiatives are enhancing the customer experience while maximizing profitability and continuing sales growth.\nMaintaining Improved Inventory Productivity and Lower Inventories\nKey elements to maintaining our improved inventory productivity include continued flow of product, a focus on regular-price selling and streamlined markdown practices. During 2019, these practices allowed us to continue to maintain our lower inventory levels. Excluding amounts to support our new Kids department, we decreased our average inventories per store by 4.5 percent at the end of fiscal 2019 as compared to the end of fiscal 2018.\nBuilding Brand Awareness\nWe are building a clear and compelling brand strategy that is designed to energize our existing customers, as well as acquire new customers. To reach a broader audience, we continue to evolve our media mix to decrease newspaper, maintain direct mail, and increase digital and broadcast media, as increased branded television advertising drives brand awareness and customers to our Ecommerce site. During 2019, we implemented a campaign management tool to execute automated marketing campaigns based on customer behavior. Utilizing point-of-sale and online browsing and spending information, we are creating targeted, personalized email and direct mail messaging focused on individuals' preferences.\nManaging Cash Flow\nWe continue to manage our cash flow by reducing debt, maintaining lower inventory levels, lowering selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses and reducing capital spending. During fiscal 2018, we successfully negotiated credit agreements totaling $275.0 million with a five-year extension. These agreements increased our revolving credit facility to $240.0 million, decreased our term loan to $35.0 million and lowered our blended interest rates. Outstanding debt at the end of 2019 was $12.0 million lower than at the end of 2018.\n2019 Highlights\nTotal sales for fiscal 2019 decreased 3.0 percent compared to fiscal 2018 and comparable store sales for 2019 decreased 1.4 percent compared to 2018. Net loss for 2019 was $10.5 million or $0.22 per share compared to net loss of $6.2 million or $0.13 per share for 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents at year-end 2019 were $9.5 million compared to $9.0 million at year-end 2018. Our 2019 balance sheet reflects capital expenditures of $5.8 million and net debt payments of $12.0 million.\nInventories were $248.6 million at the end of 2019 compared to $255.9 million at the end of 2018. Average inventories per store, excluding the impact of Kids, were down 4.5 percent from the end of 2018.\nDirect borrowings from our credit facilities decreased $12.0 million to $142.1 million at year-end 2019 compared to $154.1 million at year-end 2018.\n2020 Outlook\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 18, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores. We started reopening our stores on April 23, 2020, as state and local jurisdictions allowed, and, as of the date of this filing, we have reopened substantially all of our 281 stores in limited capacity (through reduced hours and/or social distancing measures limiting the number of customers in our stores). We are not currently able to predict when all of our stores will reopen, or the consumer purchasing behavior once all of our stores reopen. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the potential impact on our level of sales and results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and ability to secure additional merchandise in the future. We are proactively taking steps to increase available cash on hand including, but not limited to, targeted reductions in discretionary operating expenses such as advertising and payroll expenses, including furloughing a significant number of our employees and temporarily reducing the payroll of remaining employees; reducing capital expenditures, reducing merchandise receipts; and utilizing funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility and Third Promissory Note. The pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our liquidity and has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth each line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations expressed as a percentage of net sales (1):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td>101.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>101.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of merchandise sold </td> <td>73.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>73.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>(0.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(1)Table may not foot, due to rounding.\nFiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nNet Sales\nThe following table sets forth net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,219,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,257,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38,020) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales percent decrease: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable store sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales include customer purchases from our stores as well as online orders. Our online operation fulfills online orders from vendors and/or our warehouse. Store sales include online orders that are fulfilled and shipped or picked up from our stores. All online sales, regardless of fulfillment channel are referred to as omnichannel sales. The 3.0 percent decrease in net sales reflects lower comparable store sales and fewer stores for 2019. The 1.4 percent decrease in comparable stores sales, on an owned plus licensed basis, was primarily driven by a decrease in the number of transactions, with slight increases in units per transaction and average unit retail dollars. Omnichannel sales increased 11.0 percent in 2019.\nOther Revenue\nThe following table sets forth other revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,761 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in other revenue is the result of higher penetration from our growing credit card program, which has increased royalty, breakage and bounty income, partially offset by higher accrual of customer loyalty points.\nGross Profit\nThe following table compares gross profit for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,219,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,257,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38,020) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of merchandise sold </td> <td>901,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>919,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,767) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>318,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>337,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,253) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe lower gross profit rate in 2019 primarily reflects higher markdowns as a percent of sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table compares SG&A for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>336,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>348,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,102) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in SG&A expenses includes lower store-related expenses, including the impact of closed stores, lower incentive-based compensation expense, lower impairment charges and the benefit from a Visa/MasterCard claim settlement received in 2019. These items were slightly offset by higher advertising expenses for planned additional branded television, the impact of last year's change in vacation policy, and $1.6 million of costs incurred in 2019 related to the Merger Agreement that was terminated subsequent to year-end.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe following table compares interest expense for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,771) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower average debt amounts compared to last year.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table compares income tax expense for fiscal 2019 to income tax benefit for fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates, reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns, adjusted for the effect of permanent differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in both periods presented above due to a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on the weight of all available evidence. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was driven by state income taxes, permanent differences and a limitation of available credits.\nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") was enacted in March 2020 that allows the carry back of net operating losses to prior years. Accordingly, the Company filed amended income tax returns for a net income tax refund of $2.9 million with the IRS and utilized $0.9 million of the tax credit carryforwards in our amended income tax returns.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds, available cash, credit terms from vendors, our $240.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to our amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank and our $35.0 million Term Loan (as discussed below). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent temporary store closures, our revenues, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to pay vendors and landlords according to standard terms have been materially adversely impacted. As a result, our management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. Although having a going concern note in our financial statements is an Event of default under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, we have obtained waivers of such defaults as described in further detail below. We are actively negotiating with vendors and landlords regarding restructuring payment of unpaid accounts payable and rent, but there is no assurance those discussions will be successful. We are also actively exploring additional sources of financing to provide us with additional liquidity and other strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company. However, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Equipment Term Loan\nOn February 3, 2015, we entered into a $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank ( Wells Fargo\u201d) with an original maturity of February 2020 (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a secured $25.0 million master loan agreement with Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. (the Equipment Term Loan\u201d) with an original maturity of February 2018. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were initially used for a special dividend but are subsequently being used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. During 2015, debt issuance costs of $0.4 million were associated with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Equipment Term Loan. Debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Agreement were being amortized over its respective term. We repaid the Equipment Term Loan in full on January 22, 2018, at which time the associated debt issuance costs were fully amortized.\nOn February 19, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, an Accommodation Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement Amendment) during which we were not required to meet the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). This change permitted us to borrow the full amount of the then-applicable borrowing base until we delivered our financial statements for the Measurement Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ended February 28, 2018. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment, a Cash Dominion Event (as defined in the Credit Agreement Amendment) occurred as of the effective date of the Credit Agreement Amendment and at all times thereafter. Because of the Cash Dominion Event, all of our cash receipts were swept daily to repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement was classified as a short-term obligation. As noted below, the Third Credit Agreement Amendment removed the Cash Dominion Event effective September 18, 2018.\nOn March 14, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Second Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, the following: (1) the $25.0 million Tranche A-1 Revolving Loans (as defined in the Second Credit Agreement Amendment) were repaid in full with the proceeds of the Term Loan (as defined below); (2) the entry into the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below); and (3) certain other modifications and updates to coordinate the Revolving Credit Facility with the Term Loan.\nOn September 18, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the Third Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Third Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, the following: (1) the increase of Aggregate Tranche A Revolving Loan Commitments (as defined in the Second Credit Agreement Amendment) from $225.0 million to $240.0 million; (2) an extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to the earlier of (a) the maturity date of the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) or (b) September 18, 2023; and (3) the elimination of Cash Dominion Event status and a change in Cash Dominion to be triggered only in the event of (a) the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default or (b) Excess Availability of less than (A) 10.0% of the loan cap at any time or (B) 12.5% of the loan cap for three consecutive business days. During 2018, debt issuance costs of less than $0.1 million were associated with the Third Credit Agreement Amendment and are being amortized over its term. Debt issuance costs of $0.1 million remaining under the initial Credit Agreement are being amortized over the new term of the Third Credit Agreement Amendment. The elimination of cash dominion status changed the debt classification from a short-term to long-term obligation.\nOn February 26, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 4 (the Fourth Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Fourth Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, a modification to the definition of Capital Expenditures\u201d and Permitted Indebtedness\u201d as defined in the Fourth Credit Agreement Amendment.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including the requirement of a 1.0 to 1.0 consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Covenant Compliance Event, as defined in the Credit Agreement), and events of default for facilities of this type and is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted. Collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility consists of substantially all of our personal property. Wells Fargo has a first lien on all collateral other than equipment. Wells Fargo is entitled to receive an Early Termination Fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in the event the Credit Agreement is terminated prior to September 18, 2023.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are either base rate loans or London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) loans. LIBOR loans bear interest equal to the adjusted LIBOR plus the applicable margin (125 to 175 basis points), depending on the quarterly average excess availability. Base Rate Loans bear interest equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 percent, (b) the adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00 percent, or (c) the Wells Fargo prime rate,\u201d plus the applicable margin (25 to 75 basis points).\nThe weighted average interest rate for the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement was 3.29 percent as of February 1, 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, due to the financial and operating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain Events of Default occurred that were subsequently waived on June 11, 2020, when we entered into Amendment No. 5 (the \"Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment provides for, among other things, the waiver of certain Events of Default and the modification of certain provisions of the Credit Agreement subject to the conditions set forth in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. The Events of Default, which include the presence of a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020, are further defined under Specified Defaults in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. See Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our going concern evaluation. Due to the uncertainties concerning the Company's future liquidity and on-going covenant compliance as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, the amount outstanding under our Credit Facilities will be classified as a current obligation in the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter 2020.\nPursuant to the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, a Cash Dominion Event, as defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, occurred as of the effective date of such amendment through and including the first anniversary of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, and at all times thereafter unless certain conditions are met, as further set forth in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. As a result of the Cash Dominion Event, all of our cash receipts are swept daily to repay borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures in September 2023; however, as a result of the Cash Dominion Event, the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement is considered a short-term obligation as of the amendment date until the conditions to remedy the Cash Dominion Event have occurred, as defined, but not before the first anniversary of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. We manage our cash on a daily basis and borrow against the Credit Agreement based on our daily cash disbursement needs. As long as we remain within the terms of the Credit Agreement, the lenders are obligated to allow us to draw up to our borrowing availability.\nThe Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment revised the definition of Excess Availability to exclude past-due payables that are greater than sixty (60) days past due, and added a financial covenant requiring minimum Excess Availability equal to the greater of (i) five percent (5%) of the Combined Loan Cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) $10,000,000 during the Accommodation Period, which is defined as the date of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment through and including October 3, 2020 (the Accommodation Period\u201d), and thereafter requiring minimum Excess Availability equal to the greater of (i) ten percent (10%) of the Combined Loan Cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) $20,000,000. Additionally, the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment added a definition for Liquidity (as defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment), which includes, in addition to Excess Availability (less required minimum Excess Availability), amounts available in Blocked Accounts (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and amounts available for borrowing under the Trust (as defined below) and further provided for our provision of a Budget (as defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment) to Wells Fargo. Additional Events of Default under the Credit Agreement include (i) certain material deviations from the Budget calculated on a rolling 4-week basis, (ii) certain material deviations from the Budget on a rolling basis, which can be less than 4 weeks if we have failed to maintain Liquidity of $12.5 million, and (iii) failure to maintain Liquidity of $7.5 million.\nAs a result of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, LIBOR loans bear interest equal to the adjusted LIBOR plus the applicable margin (175 to 225 basis points) depending on the quarterly average excess availability for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Base Rate Loans bear interest equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 percent, (b) the adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00 percent, or (c) the Wells Fargo prime rate,\u201d plus the Applicable Margin (75 to 125 basis points). The Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment provides that during the Accommodation Period, the applicable margin will be 225 and 125 for LIBOR loans and Base Rate Loans, respectively. See the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment for further discussion.\nAs a prerequisite to obtaining the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, we are required to pay $2.5 million, pursuant to a payment plan, for outstanding accounts payable factored by Wells Fargo Trade Capital Services.\nThe Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment also added or amended certain definitions and terms including the LIBOR Replacement and Benchmark Transition Event, Accelerated Borrowing Base Weekly Delivery Event, Early Termination Fee, and certain financial covenants, all of which are defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment.\nTerm Loan\nOn March 14, 2018, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Gordon Brothers Finance Company, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Term Loan Agent\u201d), and Gordon Brothers Finance Company, LLC, as lender (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d). The Term Loan Agreement provided for a term loan in the amount of $50.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d). Debt issuance costs associated with the Term Loan were capitalized in the amount of $0.9 million and are being amortized over the term of the Term Loan. The net proceeds of $49.1 million from the Term Loan were used to permanently pay off the $25.0 million Tranche A-1 Revolving Loan (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and to pay down the Revolving Credit Facility. After utilizing proceeds from the Term Loan for repayment of amounts outstanding under the existing Tranche A-1 Revolving Loans, the Term Loan resulted in an increase in our Excess Availability of approximately $25.0 million under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Term Loan originally matured on the earlier of (1) the termination date specified in our Credit Agreement, as such date may be extended with the consent of the Term Loan Agent or in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (defined below), and (2) March 14, 2020.\nOn September 18, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Term Loan Amendment\u201d) to the Term Loan with Gordon Brothers Finance Company. The Second Term Loan Amendment provided for, among other things, the following: (1) the reduction of the maximum amount of the Term Loan to $35.0 million; (2) an extension of the maturity date of the Term Loan Agreement to the earlier of (a) the termination date specified in the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in the Third Credit Agreement Amendment), and (b) September 18, 2023; (3) the reduction of the non-default interest rate applicable to the Term Loan under the Term Loan Agreement to a fluctuating rate of interest equal to three-month LIBOR (with a floor of 1.5%) plus 8.25% per annum; and (4) the elimination of Cash Dominion Event status and a change in Cash Dominion to be triggered only in the event of (a) the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default or (b) Excess Availability of less than (A) 10.0% of the Revolving Loan Cap at any time or (B) 12.5% of the Revolving Loan Cap for three consecutive Business Days. During 2018, debt issuance costs of approximately $0.3 million were associated with the Term Loan and are being amortized over its term. The elimination of cash dominion status changed the debt classification from a short-term to long-term obligation.\nOn February 26, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the Third Term Loan Amendment\u201d) to the Term Loan Agreement. The Third Term Loan Amendment provided for, among other things, a modification to the definition of Capital Expenditures\u201d and Permitted Indebtedness\u201d as defined in the Third Term Loan Amendment.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and affirmative and negative covenants, which include the retention of the existing minimum 1.0 to 1.0 consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the Credit Agreement during periods where Revolving Excess Availability (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) is less than the greater of $20.0 million or 10.0 percent of Combined Loan Cap (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) for four consecutive business days or during the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement).\nThe Term Loan is secured by a second lien security interest (subordinate only to the liens securing the Credit Agreement) on all assets securing the Credit Agreement (which consist of substantially all of our personal property), except furniture, fixtures and equipment and intellectual property, upon which the Term Loan lenders have a first lien security interest. If at any time prior to the first anniversary date of the Term Loan, the Revolving Excess Availability is less than $20.0 million, if requested by the Term Loan Agent, the Term Loan will also be secured by a first lien on leasehold interests in real property with an aggregate value of not less than $10.0 million, and the Credit Agreement will be secured by a second lien on such leasehold interests.\nThe Term Loan is subject to certain mandatory prepayments if an Event of Default (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) exists. If no such Event of Default exists, proceeds of the Term Loan priority collateral are to be applied to amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nOn June 11, 2020, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Waiver (the \"Fourth Term Loan Amendment\") with Gordon Brothers Finance Company. The Fourth Term Loan Amendment provides for, among other things, the waiver of certain Events of Default and the modification of certain provisions of the Term Loan, subject to the conditions set forth in the Fourth Term Loan Amendment. The Events of Default, which include the presence of a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020, are further defined under Specified Defaults in the Fourth Term Loan Amendment. See Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our going concern evaluation. Due to the uncertainties concerning the Company's future liquidity and on-going covenant compliance as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, the amount outstanding under our Term Loan will be classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter 2020.\nThe Fourth Term Loan Amendment revised the definition of Revolving Excess Availability to exclude past-due payables that are greater than sixty (60) days past due, and added a financial covenant requiring minimum Revolving Excess Availability equal to the greater of (i) five percent (5%) of the Combined Loan Cap (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) and (ii) $10,000,000 during the Accommodation Period, which is defined as the date of the Fourth Term Loan Amendment through and including October 3, 2020 (the Term Loan Accommodation Period\u201d), and thereafter requiring minimum Revolving Excess Availability equal to the greater of (i) ten percent (10%) of the Combined Loan Cap (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) and (ii) $20,000,000. Additionally, the Fourth Term Loan Amendment added a definition for Liquidity (as defined in the Fourth Term Loan Amendment), which includes, in addition to Revolving Excess Availability (less required minimum Revolving Excess Availability), amounts available in Blocked Accounts (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) and amounts available for borrowing under the Trust (as defined below) and further provided for our provision of a Budget (as defined in the Fourth Term Loan Amendment) to Gordon Brothers Finance Company. Additional Events of Default under the Credit Agreement include (i) certain material deviations from the Budget calculated on a rolling 4-week basis, (ii) certain material deviations from the Budget on a rolling basis, which can be less than 4 weeks if we have failed to maintain Liquidity of $12.5 million, and (iii) failure to maintain Liquidity of $7.5 million.\nThe Fourth Term Loan Amendment also added or amended certain definitions and terms including Accelerated Borrowing Base Weekly Delivery Event, and certain financial covenants, all of which are defined in the Fourth Term Loan Amendment. Additionally, our obligation to pay the Term Loan Prepayment Fee (as defined in the Term Loan) in the event the Term Loan is prepaid was extended to the third anniversary of the Fourth Term Loan Amendment.\nThe Term Loan Agent and Wells Fargo have entered into an Intercreditor Agreement dated as of March 14, 2018 (the Intercreditor Agreement\u201d), acknowledged by us under the Term Loan and the Credit Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement was amended on September 18, 2018 to incorporate the amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Agreement, and subsequently amended on June 11, 2020 to incorporate the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility and Fourth Term Loan Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement.\nThe weighted average interest rate for the amount outstanding under the Term Loan was 10.16 percent as of February 1, 2020.\nPromissory Note\nWe believe we can borrow, on a short-term basis and subject to the formal agreement of the lender, amounts up to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies related to our executive deferred compensation plans to provide additional liquidity if needed. At February 1, 2020, the cash surrender value of our life insurance policies was $13.1 million.\nOn February 2, 2018, we executed a promissory note under which we borrowed approximately $13.7 million (the Promissory Note\u201d) from SunTrust Bank (the Trustee\u201d) in its capacity as the trustee under a trust agreement (the Trust Agreement\u201d) dated September 1, 1999. The trust established by the Trust Agreement (the Trust\u201d) holds certain life insurance policies related to our executive deferred compensation plans. The Trustee obtained loans from the insurance policies held in the Trust in an amount not less than the amount of the Promissory Note. The Promissory Note was a short-term obligation and the proceeds were used to pay down borrowings under the existing Credit Agreement, which provided additional availability under that agreement. The Promissory Note had a fixed interest rate of 3.58 percent per annum and an original maturity date of April 1, 2018.\nOn March 7, 2018, we executed an amendment to the Promissory Note under which the Trustee extended the maturity date of the note from April 1, 2018, to July 1, 2018 (the Maturity Date\u201d). The amendment did not alter the short-term nature of the Promissory Note. The Promissory Note could be prepaid in whole or in part at any time. All unpaid principal and accrued interest on the Promissory Note would have become due and payable on the Maturity Date. The Trustee could offset payments due under the Promissory Note against amounts we would otherwise be entitled to withdraw from the Trust under the terms of the Trust Agreement. On June 29, 2018, we repaid the outstanding balance of the Promissory Note.\nOn July 31, 2018, we executed a second promissory note from SunTrust Bank for $13.0 million (the \"Second Promissory Note\"), which carried a fixed interest rate of 3.58 percent per annum and an original maturity date of September 10, 2018. This note included the same terms as the Promissory Note executed on February 2, 2018. On September 10, 2018, we repaid the outstanding balance of the Second Promissory Note.\nSubsequent to year-end on March 23, 2020, we borrowed $9.9 million on the cash surrender value of our life insurance policies at a rate of 3.56 percent per annum, which accrues daily on the average loan balance for the number of days the loan is outstanding prior to the date of repayment (the \"Third Promissory Note\"). The cash surrender value of our life insurance was approximately $11.0 million at the time the Third Promissory Note was executed, due to changing market conditions subsequent to year-end. The proceeds of the Third Promissory Note will be used to pay down borrowings under the existing credit agreement, which provided additional availability under that agreement. The entire unpaid principal and accrued interest balance is due and payable on or before September 30, 2020.\nCash flows and availability\nCash flows from operations are driven by sales as well as the credit terms available to us from our vendors and their factors. Our sales generate cash almost immediately and are affected by customer traffic to our stores and the desirability of our merchandise to those customers. Customer traffic is in turn affected by our marketing and advertising, general economic and business conditions, weather and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic and civil unrest. Changes in these factors could have a material effect on our ability to generate sales and thus cash inflows to operate our business, and a prolonged store closure would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months.\nOur cash outflows can be materially affected by changes in credit terms and availability from our vendors and their factors. During the first quarter of 2018, our vendors and factors constricted our credit terms and limits significantly. This was a reaction to our 2017 third-quarter results, as well as concern about the general retail environment at the time, which included multiple bankruptcies and restructurings by other retailers in the same business. This constriction caused us to make payments to our vendors and factors more quickly than in prior periods, thus increasing our debt levels during that period. The added availability from the Term Loan Agreement was a key part of our ability to fund the accelerated payments. During this time, we successfully managed our vendor and factor relationships to maintain the flow of our merchandise during the key early spring selling period. Throughout all periods, we made our payments to vendors and their factors on a timely basis in accordance with our negotiated terms.\nIn March 2018, after we announced our fourth quarter 2017 results and outlook for spring 2018, our terms with the vendors and their factors began to be less constricted. At that same time, we also announced our Term Loan Agreement. We have non-disclosure agreements with the major factors, credit insurers and several of our largest vendors that allow us to communicate our operating results and cash flows to them on a regular basis. Additionally, we made presentations to larger groups of our vendors just after our fourth quarter 2017 results were announced in March 2018. We continue to communicate our operating results and cash flows to our large vendors and factors with whom we have non-disclosure agreements in place. These steps have contributed to the positive movement in their credit arrangements with us.\nIn March 2020, the Company announced the temporary closure of all stores for an unknown period of time and significant actions taken to mitigate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its cash flows to protect its business and associates for the long term in response to the crisis. Such actions include targeted reductions in discretionary operating expenses such as advertising and payroll expenses, including furloughing a significant number of our employees and temporarily reducing the payroll of remaining employees, suspensions and/or deferrals of payments due to landlords and vendors, reducing capital expenditures, reducing merchandise receipts, and utilizing funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility and Third Promissory Note. Further, we have sought and are seeking extended payment terms with all vendors, including merchandise, expense and rent vendors. Although we have since reopened many of our stores starting on April 23, 2020, we are unable to predict when all of our stores will completely reopen or reach pre-pandemic levels or if additional periods of store closures will be needed or mandated. Further, we are unable to predict when consumer spending patterns will normalize. Continued impacts of the pandemic could materially adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows, ability to secure suitable merchandise and may require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, further employee furloughs, reduced store hours, store closings, expense reductions or discounting of pricing of our products, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The outcome of the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and is dependent upon factors that are outside of the Company's control, including actions of federal and local governments and consumer behavior once all our stores are able to reopen. There is no assurance that additional credit or liquidity will be available to us.\nThe significant risks and uncertainties related to the Company's liquidity described above raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and other commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of this uncertainty on the recoverability or classification of recorded assets amounts or the amounts or classifications of liabilities.\nOur working capital fluctuates with seasonal variations that affect our borrowings and availability. Our availability is highest just after our strong seasonal spring and holiday selling seasons and is lowest just before those seasons as we build inventory levels. Working capital is also used to support capital investments for maintenance of our existing stores, system improvements and new store openings. We have reduced our capital investments to enhance our cash flows. These reduced levels of investment can be sustained for the foreseeable future as prior to this our store base and systems have been well maintained. Positive operating results and cash flows will help us preserve satisfactory credit terms and allow us to operate within the borrowing availability under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement. However, the disruption caused by the pandemic will require us to negotiate extended payment terms and other accommodations with landlords and vendors to address past-due payables.\nAs of February 1, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.5 million and $107.1 million in borrowings under our Credit Agreement and $35.0 million in borrowings under the Term Loan, for a total of $141.4 million in outstanding borrowings, which is net of $0.7 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. As of February 2, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.0 million, and borrowings under our Credit Agreement of $119.1 million and $35.0 million in borrowings under the Term Loan, for a total of $153.3 million in outstanding borrowings, which is net of $0.8 in unamortized debt issuance costs. The total amount available for borrowings and letters of credit under our Credit Agreement is the lesser of $240.0 million or 100 percent of eligible credit card receivables and the net recovery percentage value of inventories less reserves. On February 1, 2020, in addition to outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and Term Loan, we had $7.9 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our Excess Availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was $54.2 million on February 1, 2020. In addition, we had $13.1 million available to borrow, on a short-term basis, which would be collateralized by life insurance policies at the end of the year. See Note 6, \"Debt\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth cash flow data for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in): </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(2,850) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,183) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(13,397) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,070) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,351) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $16.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $8.9 million for fiscal 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was mainly due to lower accounts payable cash flows of $2.7 million in 2019 compared to $29.8 million in 2018, partially offset by changes in inventory of $7.1 million, increased net loss of $4.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 and $8.0 million in changes for other non-cash charges.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.9 million during fiscal 2019 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $6.2 million during fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, the total capital expenditures were $5.8 million and included approximately $2.4 million for information systems improvements and $3.4 million for existing store improvements. For fiscal 2018, the total capital expenditures were $9.0 million and included approximately $3.6 million for information systems improvements, $2.7 million for new and relocated stores, and $2.7 million for existing store improvements.\nCash used in financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $13.4 million during fiscal 2019 compared to cash used in financing activities of $4.1 million during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, we had net repayments of debt of $12.0 million and made capital lease payments of $1.3 million. During fiscal 2018, we had net repayments of debt of $2.0 million. We paid debt issuance costs of $1.1 million, accrued cash dividends on employee stock awards vesting in 2018 of $0.2 million, and made capital lease payments of $0.7 million. In addition, we repurchased 0.1 million shares of common stock related to withholding taxes due on the vesting of employee stock awards for $0.1 million. We also received $0.2 million from our Employee Share Purchase Plan. See Note 10, \"Shareholders' Equity\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCapital Leases\nDuring fiscal year 2019, Stein Mart entered into two separate finance agreements for Light-Emitting Diode (\"LED\") lighting in certain of our stores. Depending on the scope of the lighting remodel, the leased lighting equipment has a useful life of five years or ten years; the equipment will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the respective periods. The leased equipment was recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments, as this is equal to the fair value of the equipment. This is in addition to the networking and telephone equipment obtained through capital leases during fiscal year 2017.\nThe gross value of assets subject to capital leases was $6.9 million as of February 1, 2020, and is included in property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining capital lease obligation of $4.8 million as of February 1, 2020, is split between accrued expenses and other current liabilities for the short-term portion and other liabilities for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEffect of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations to date. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have outstanding standby letters of credit totaling $7.9 million securing certain insurance programs at February 1, 2020. If specified conditions were to occur under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience, we do not expect to make any payments. There are no other off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. While we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate, which could require adjustments of these estimates in future periods. A summary of the more significant accounting policies follows.\nRetail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation\nInventories are valued using the lower of cost or market value, determined by the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method ( RIM\u201d), the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. RIM is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry. The use of the retail inventory method results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the RIM calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including, among others, merchandise markon, markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the corresponding charge to cost of merchandise sold. In addition, failure to take appropriate permanent markdowns currently can result in an overstatement of inventory.\nWe perform physical inventory counts at all stores once per year, in either the summer or January. Included in the carrying value of merchandise inventories between physical counts is a reserve for estimated shrinkage. That estimate is based on historical physical inventory results. The difference between actual and estimated shrinkage may cause fluctuations in quarterly results but was not significant in 2019 and 2018.\nVendor Allowances\nWe receive allowances from some of our vendors, primarily related to markdown reimbursement, damaged/defective merchandise and vendor non-compliance issues. Vendor allowances are recorded when earned. Allowances received from vendors related to the profitability of inventory recently sold are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold in the later of the period that the merchandise markdown is incurred or the allowance is negotiated. Allowances received from vendors related to damaged/defective inventory are reflected as reductions in the cost of merchandise as it is received. Allowances received due to vendors' failure to comply with our policies (primarily violations of shipping and merchandise preparation requirements) are reflected as a reduction of the cost of the merchandise when identified during the receiving process. Although it is unlikely that there will be a significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if a reduction were to occur, we could experience a higher cost of merchandise sold.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors used in the review include management's plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. For long-lived assets held for use, including right-of-use assets, an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets. The amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Impairment reviews are performed for individual stores during the fourth quarter, or more frequently should circumstances change. A significant decrease in cash flows could result in an increase in asset impairment charges. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded $0.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in asset impairment charges.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for various risks, including workers' compensation, general liability and associate-related health care benefits. We are responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits. The reserves recorded for these claims are actuarially estimated based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported. These reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled. The estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions. As of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, insurance reserves of $16.2 million and $16.3 million, respectively, were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results.\nFor a complete listing of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information\", of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information\", of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "summary": "This report discusses the financial condition and results of operations of a national omnichannel off-price retailer, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, the company had to temporarily close its stores, resulting in a material adverse impact on its revenues, liquidity, and operating cash flows. As a result, the management has expressed substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months. The report covers the company's strategies and actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, its financial performance for the fiscal year 2019, and its liquidity and capital resources, including details about its credit facilities and term loan.\n\nThe company's revenue and income were negatively affected, with a decrease in total sales and net loss compared to the previous year. The report also discusses the company's management efforts to negotiate with vendors and landlords and explore additional sources of financing to address its liquidity challenges.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements in light of new information, future events or otherwise. Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.\nOverview\nWe are a national specialty omnichannel off-price retailer offering designer and name-brand fashion apparel, home d\u00e9cor, accessories and shoes at everyday discount prices.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nIn response to the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic, on March 18, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores through March 31, 2020. On March 31, 2020, based on guidance from federal, state and local government and health authorities, and in the interest of the health and safety of our customers and associates, we extended the temporary closure of all stores beyond the previously announced March 31 date. We started reopening stores on April 23, 2020 as government jurisdictions have allowed, and as of the date of this filing, we have reopened substantially all of our stores with limited operating hours. We have implemented significant actions to mitigate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flow to protect our business and associates for the long term. These actions include furloughing most store associates and a significant number of associates in our supply chain network and corporate offices. In addition, we have temporarily reduced the salaries of our executive management by 20 percent and associates not furloughed by a lower rate, and the Board of Directors has suspended its compensation. We have also been working with vendors and landlords to negotiate temporary terms and have utilized funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility and Third Promissory Note (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included in Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further discussion).\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent temporary store closures, our revenues, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to pay vendors and landlords according to standard terms have been materially adversely impacted. Accordingly, our management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. Although having a going concern note in our financial statements is an Event of default under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, we have obtained waivers of such defaults as described in further detail in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included in Item 7 below. We are actively negotiating with vendors and landlords regarding restructuring payment of unpaid accounts payable and rent, but there is no assurance those discussions will be successful. We are also actively exploring additional sources of financing to provide us with additional liquidity and other strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company. However, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nAs stores have reopened, the traffic at our stores has steadily increased, but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Although omnichannel sales have remained strong, they have not compensated for the loss of in-store sales. Sales continue to recover as our stores reopen, but remain well below last year.\n2019 Strategic Priorities\nEvolving Product Mix\nWe are continually evolving our product mix so that it is more relevant to a broader base of customers. We do this by focusing on our off-price characteristics of buying more in-season and opportunistically and consistently adding categories, brands, trends and newness to increase productivity and regular-priced selling. During fall 2019, we launched our new Kids department in all stores and fine jewelry in 50-plus stores.\nExpanding Omnichannel Capabilities\nWe continue to develop our online content and capabilities to more fully integrate our online business with our stores to provide our customers with an enhanced omnichannel experience. During 2019, Omnichannel sales grew 11 percent as a result of several initiatives. We became the first off-price retailer to roll out a buy online, pick up in store service ( BOPIS\u201d) to drive store traffic and create incremental attachment sales. Our ship-from-store program continues to drive volume and improve inventory productivity. In 2019, we added smart fulfillment logic to identify the best location to fill online orders, shorten delivery times and reduce shipping and fulfillment costs. In our stores, we added \"endless aisle\" mobile technology to assist customers in locating product across the enterprise and then placing an online order. We also expanded our product offerings with more drop shipments from vendors and improved our mobile capabilities. These initiatives are enhancing the customer experience while maximizing profitability and continuing sales growth.\nMaintaining Improved Inventory Productivity and Lower Inventories\nKey elements to maintaining our improved inventory productivity include continued flow of product, a focus on regular-price selling and streamlined markdown practices. During 2019, these practices allowed us to continue to maintain our lower inventory levels. Excluding amounts to support our new Kids department, we decreased our average inventories per store by 4.5 percent at the end of fiscal 2019 as compared to the end of fiscal 2018.\nBuilding Brand Awareness\nWe are building a clear and compelling brand strategy that is designed to energize our existing customers, as well as acquire new customers. To reach a broader audience, we continue to evolve our media mix to decrease newspaper, maintain direct mail, and increase digital and broadcast media, as increased branded television advertising drives brand awareness and customers to our Ecommerce site. During 2019, we implemented a campaign management tool to execute automated marketing campaigns based on customer behavior. Utilizing point-of-sale and online browsing and spending information, we are creating targeted, personalized email and direct mail messaging focused on individuals' preferences.\nManaging Cash Flow\nWe continue to manage our cash flow by reducing debt, maintaining lower inventory levels, lowering selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses and reducing capital spending. During fiscal 2018, we successfully negotiated credit agreements totaling $275.0 million with a five-year extension. These agreements increased our revolving credit facility to $240.0 million, decreased our term loan to $35.0 million and lowered our blended interest rates. Outstanding debt at the end of 2019 was $12.0 million lower than at the end of 2018.\n2019 Highlights\nTotal sales for fiscal 2019 decreased 3.0 percent compared to fiscal 2018 and comparable store sales for 2019 decreased 1.4 percent compared to 2018. Net loss for 2019 was $10.5 million or $0.22 per share compared to net loss of $6.2 million or $0.13 per share for 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents at year-end 2019 were $9.5 million compared to $9.0 million at year-end 2018. Our 2019 balance sheet reflects capital expenditures of $5.8 million and net debt payments of $12.0 million.\nInventories were $248.6 million at the end of 2019 compared to $255.9 million at the end of 2018. Average inventories per store, excluding the impact of Kids, were down 4.5 percent from the end of 2018.\nDirect borrowings from our credit facilities decreased $12.0 million to $142.1 million at year-end 2019 compared to $154.1 million at year-end 2018.\n2020 Outlook\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 18, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores. We started reopening our stores on April 23, 2020, as state and local jurisdictions allowed, and, as of the date of this filing, we have reopened substantially all of our 281 stores in limited capacity (through reduced hours and/or social distancing measures limiting the number of customers in our stores). We are not currently able to predict when all of our stores will reopen, or the consumer purchasing behavior once all of our stores reopen. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the potential impact on our level of sales and results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and ability to secure additional merchandise in the future. We are proactively taking steps to increase available cash on hand including, but not limited to, targeted reductions in discretionary operating expenses such as advertising and payroll expenses, including furloughing a significant number of our employees and temporarily reducing the payroll of remaining employees; reducing capital expenditures, reducing merchandise receipts; and utilizing funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility and Third Promissory Note. The pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our liquidity and has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth each line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations expressed as a percentage of net sales (1):\n\n_______________\n(1)Table may not foot, due to rounding.\nFiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nNet Sales\nThe following table sets forth net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nNet sales include customer purchases from our stores as well as online orders. Our online operation fulfills online orders from vendors and/or our warehouse. Store sales include online orders that are fulfilled and shipped or picked up from our stores. All online sales, regardless of fulfillment channel are referred to as omnichannel sales. The 3.0 percent decrease in net sales reflects lower comparable store sales and fewer stores for 2019. The 1.4 percent decrease in comparable stores sales, on an owned plus licensed basis, was primarily driven by a decrease in the number of transactions, with slight increases in units per transaction and average unit retail dollars. Omnichannel sales increased 11.0 percent in 2019.\nOther Revenue\nThe following table sets forth other revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nThe increase in other revenue is the result of higher penetration from our growing credit card program, which has increased royalty, breakage and bounty income, partially offset by higher accrual of customer loyalty points.\nGross Profit\nThe following table compares gross profit for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nThe lower gross profit rate in 2019 primarily reflects higher markdowns as a percent of sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table compares SG&A for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in SG&A expenses includes lower store-related expenses, including the impact of closed stores, lower incentive-based compensation expense, lower impairment charges and the benefit from a Visa/MasterCard claim settlement received in 2019. These items were slightly offset by higher advertising expenses for planned additional branded television, the impact of last year's change in vacation policy, and $1.6 million of costs incurred in 2019 related to the Merger Agreement that was terminated subsequent to year-end.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe following table compares interest expense for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower average debt amounts compared to last year.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table compares income tax expense for fiscal 2019 to income tax benefit for fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nOur effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates, reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns, adjusted for the effect of permanent differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in both periods presented above due to a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on the weight of all available evidence. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was driven by state income taxes, permanent differences and a limitation of available credits.\nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") was enacted in March 2020 that allows the carry back of net operating losses to prior years. Accordingly, the Company filed amended income tax returns for a net income tax refund of $2.9 million with the IRS and utilized $0.9 million of the tax credit carryforwards in our amended income tax returns.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds, available cash, credit terms from vendors, our $240.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to our amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank and our $35.0 million Term Loan (as discussed below). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent temporary store closures, our revenues, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to pay vendors and landlords according to standard terms have been materially adversely impacted. As a result, our management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. Although having a going concern note in our financial statements is an Event of default under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, we have obtained waivers of such defaults as described in further detail below. We are actively negotiating with vendors and landlords regarding restructuring payment of unpaid accounts payable and rent, but there is no assurance those discussions will be successful. We are also actively exploring additional sources of financing to provide us with additional liquidity and other strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company. However, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Equipment Term Loan\nOn February 3, 2015, we entered into a $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank ( Wells Fargo\u201d) with an original maturity of February 2020 (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a secured $25.0 million master loan agreement with Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. (the Equipment Term Loan\u201d) with an original maturity of February 2018. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were initially used for a special dividend but are subsequently being used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. During 2015, debt issuance costs of $0.4 million were associated with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Equipment Term Loan. Debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Agreement were being amortized over its respective term. We repaid the Equipment Term Loan in full on January 22, 2018, at which time the associated debt issuance costs were fully amortized.\nOn February 19, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, an Accommodation Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement Amendment) during which we were not required to meet the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). This change permitted us to borrow the full amount of the then-applicable borrowing base until we delivered our financial statements for the Measurement Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ended February 28, 2018. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment, a Cash Dominion Event (as defined in the Credit Agreement Amendment) occurred as of the effective date of the Credit Agreement Amendment and at all times thereafter. Because of the Cash Dominion Event, all of our cash receipts were swept daily to repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement was classified as a short-term obligation. As noted below, the Third Credit Agreement Amendment removed the Cash Dominion Event effective September 18, 2018.\nOn March 14, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Second Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, the following: (1) the $25.0 million Tranche A-1 Revolving Loans (as defined in the Second Credit Agreement Amendment) were repaid in full with the proceeds of the Term Loan (as defined below); (2) the entry into the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below); and (3) certain other modifications and updates to coordinate the Revolving Credit Facility with the Term Loan.\nOn September 18, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the Third Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Third Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, the following: (1) the increase of Aggregate Tranche A Revolving Loan Commitments (as defined in the Second Credit Agreement Amendment) from $225.0 million to $240.0 million; (2) an extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to the earlier of (a) the maturity date of the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) or (b) September 18, 2023; and (3) the elimination of Cash Dominion Event status and a change in Cash Dominion to be triggered only in the event of (a) the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default or (b) Excess Availability of less than (A) 10.0% of the loan cap at any time or (B) 12.5% of the loan cap for three consecutive business days. During 2018, debt issuance costs of less than $0.1 million were associated with the Third Credit Agreement Amendment and are being amortized over its term. Debt issuance costs of $0.1 million remaining under the initial Credit Agreement are being amortized over the new term of the Third Credit Agreement Amendment. The elimination of cash dominion status changed the debt classification from a short-term to long-term obligation.\nOn February 26, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 4 (the Fourth Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Fourth Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, a modification to the definition of Capital Expenditures\u201d and Permitted Indebtedness\u201d as defined in the Fourth Credit Agreement Amendment.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including the requirement of a 1.0 to 1.0 consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Covenant Compliance Event, as defined in the Credit Agreement), and events of default for facilities of this type and is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted. Collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility consists of substantially all of our personal property. Wells Fargo has a first lien on all collateral other than equipment. Wells Fargo is entitled to receive an Early Termination Fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in the event the Credit Agreement is terminated prior to September 18, 2023.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are either base rate loans or London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) loans. LIBOR loans bear interest equal to the adjusted LIBOR plus the applicable margin (125 to 175 basis points), depending on the quarterly average excess availability. Base Rate Loans bear interest equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 percent, (b) the adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00 percent, or (c) the Wells Fargo prime rate,\u201d plus the applicable margin (25 to 75 basis points).\nThe weighted average interest rate for the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement was 3.29 percent as of February 1, 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, due to the financial and operating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain Events of Default occurred that were subsequently waived on June 11, 2020, when we entered into Amendment No. 5 (the \"Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment provides for, among other things, the waiver of certain Events of Default and the modification of certain provisions of the Credit Agreement subject to the conditions set forth in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. The Events of Default, which include the presence of a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020, are further defined under Specified Defaults in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. See Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our going concern evaluation. Due to the uncertainties concerning the Company's future liquidity and on-going covenant compliance as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, the amount outstanding under our Credit Facilities will be classified as a current obligation in the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter 2020.\nPursuant to the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, a Cash Dominion Event, as defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, occurred as of the effective date of such amendment through and including the first anniversary of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, and at all times thereafter unless certain conditions are met, as further set forth in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. As a result of the Cash Dominion Event, all of our cash receipts are swept daily to repay borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures in September 2023; however, as a result of the Cash Dominion Event, the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement is considered a short-term obligation as of the amendment date until the conditions to remedy the Cash Dominion Event have occurred, as defined, but not before the first anniversary of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. We manage our cash on a daily basis and borrow against the Credit Agreement based on our daily cash disbursement needs. As long as we remain within the terms of the Credit Agreement, the lenders are obligated to allow us to draw up to our borrowing availability.\nThe Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment revised the definition of Excess Availability to exclude past-due payables that are greater than sixty (60) days past due, and added a financial covenant requiring minimum Excess Availability equal to the greater of (i) five percent (5%) of the Combined Loan Cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) $10,000,000 during the Accommodation Period, which is defined as the date of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment through and including October 3, 2020 (the Accommodation Period\u201d), and thereafter requiring minimum Excess Availability equal to the greater of (i) ten percent (10%) of the Combined Loan Cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) $20,000,000. Additionally, the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment added a definition for Liquidity (as defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment), which includes, in addition to Excess Availability (less required minimum Excess Availability), amounts available in Blocked Accounts (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and amounts available for borrowing under the Trust (as defined below) and further provided for our provision of a Budget (as defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment) to Wells Fargo. Additional Events of Default under the Credit Agreement include (i) certain material deviations from the Budget calculated on a rolling 4-week basis, (ii) certain material deviations from the Budget on a rolling basis, which can be less than 4 weeks if we have failed to maintain Liquidity of $12.5 million, and (iii) failure to maintain Liquidity of $7.5 million.\nAs a result of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, LIBOR loans bear interest equal to the adjusted LIBOR plus the applicable margin (175 to 225 basis points) depending on the quarterly average excess availability for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Base Rate Loans bear interest equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 percent, (b) the adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00 percent, or (c) the Wells Fargo prime rate,\u201d plus the Applicable Margin (75 to 125 basis points). The Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment provides that during the Accommodation Period, the applicable margin will be 225 and 125 for LIBOR loans and Base Rate Loans, respectively. See the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment for further discussion.\nAs a prerequisite to obtaining the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, we are required to pay $2.5 million, pursuant to a payment plan, for outstanding accounts payable factored by Wells Fargo Trade Capital Services.\nThe Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment also added or amended certain definitions and terms including the LIBOR Replacement and Benchmark Transition Event, Accelerated Borrowing Base Weekly Delivery Event, Early Termination Fee, and certain financial covenants, all of which are defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment.\nTerm Loan\nOn March 14, 2018, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Gordon Brothers Finance Company, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Term Loan Agent\u201d), and Gordon Brothers Finance Company, LLC, as lender (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d). The Term Loan Agreement provided for a term loan in the amount of $50.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d). Debt issuance costs associated with the Term Loan were capitalized in the amount of $0.9 million and are being amortized over the term of the Term Loan. The net proceeds of $49.1 million from the Term Loan were used to permanently pay off the $25.0 million Tranche A-1 Revolving Loan (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and to pay", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Accordingly, our management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. Although having a going concern note in our financial statements is an Event of default under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, we have obtained waivers of such defaults as described in further detail in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included in Item 7 below. We are actively negotiating with vendors and landlords regarding restructuring payment of unpaid accounts payable and rent, but there is no assurance those discussions will be successful. We are also actively exploring additional sources of financing to provide us with additional liquidity and other strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company. However, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nAs stores have reopened, the traffic at our stores has steadily increased, but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Although omnichannel sales have remained strong, they have not compensated for the loss of in-store sales. Sales continue to recover as our stores reopen, but remain well below last year.\n2019 Strategic Priorities\nEvolving Product Mix\nWe are continually evolving our product mix so that it is more relevant to a broader base of customers. We do this by focusing on our off-price characteristics of buying more in-season and opportunistically and consistently adding categories, brands, trends and newness to increase productivity and regular-priced selling. During fall 2019, we launched our new Kids department in all stores and fine jewelry in 50-plus stores.\nExpanding Omnichannel Capabilities\nWe continue to develop our online content and capabilities to more fully integrate our online business with our stores to provide our customers with an enhanced omnichannel experience. During 2019, Omnichannel sales grew 11 percent as a result of several initiatives. We became the first off-price retailer to roll out a buy online, pick up in store service ( BOPIS\u201d) to drive store traffic and create incremental attachment sales. Our ship-from-store program continues to drive volume and improve inventory productivity. In 2019, we added smart fulfillment logic to identify the best location to fill online orders, shorten delivery times and reduce shipping and fulfillment costs. In our stores, we added \"endless aisle\" mobile technology to assist customers in locating product across the enterprise and then placing an online order. We also expanded our product offerings with more drop shipments from vendors and improved our mobile capabilities. These initiatives are enhancing the customer experience while maximizing profitability and continuing sales growth.\nMaintaining Improved Inventory Productivity and Lower Inventories\nKey elements to maintaining our improved inventory productivity include continued flow of product, a focus on regular-price selling and streamlined markdown practices. During 2019, these practices allowed us to continue to maintain our lower inventory levels. Excluding amounts to support our new Kids department, we decreased our average inventories per store by 4.5 percent at the end of fiscal 2019 as compared to the end of fiscal 2018.\nBuilding Brand Awareness\nWe are building a clear and compelling brand strategy that is designed to energize our existing customers, as well as acquire new customers. To reach a broader audience, we continue to evolve our media mix to decrease newspaper, maintain direct mail, and increase digital and broadcast media, as increased branded television advertising drives brand awareness and customers to our Ecommerce site. During 2019, we implemented a campaign management tool to execute automated marketing campaigns based on customer behavior. Utilizing point-of-sale and online browsing and spending information, we are creating targeted, personalized email and direct mail messaging focused on individuals' preferences.\nManaging Cash Flow\nWe continue to manage our cash flow by reducing debt, maintaining lower inventory levels, lowering selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses and reducing capital spending. During fiscal 2018, we successfully negotiated credit agreements totaling $275.0 million with a five-year extension. These agreements increased our revolving credit facility to $240.0 million, decreased our term loan to $35.0 million and lowered our blended interest rates. Outstanding debt at the end of 2019 was $12.0 million lower than at the end of 2018.\n2019 Highlights\nTotal sales for fiscal 2019 decreased 3.0 percent compared to fiscal 2018 and comparable store sales for 2019 decreased 1.4 percent compared to 2018. Net loss for 2019 was $10.5 million or $0.22 per share compared to net loss of $6.2 million or $0.13 per share for 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents at year-end 2019 were $9.5 million compared to $9.0 million at year-end 2018. Our 2019 balance sheet reflects capital expenditures of $5.8 million and net debt payments of $12.0 million.\nInventories were $248.6 million at the end of 2019 compared to $255.9 million at the end of 2018. Average inventories per store, excluding the impact of Kids, were down 4.5 percent from the end of 2018.\nDirect borrowings from our credit facilities decreased $12.0 million to $142.1 million at year-end 2019 compared to $154.1 million at year-end 2018.\n2020 Outlook\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 18, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores. We started reopening our stores on April 23, 2020, as state and local jurisdictions allowed, and, as of the date of this filing, we have reopened substantially all of our 281 stores in limited capacity (through reduced hours and/or social distancing measures limiting the number of customers in our stores). We are not currently able to predict when all of our stores will reopen, or the consumer purchasing behavior once all of our stores reopen. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the potential impact on our level of sales and results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and ability to secure additional merchandise in the future. We are proactively taking steps to increase available cash on hand including, but not limited to, targeted reductions in discretionary operating expenses such as advertising and payroll expenses, including furloughing a significant number of our employees and temporarily reducing the payroll of remaining employees; reducing capital expenditures, reducing merchandise receipts; and utilizing funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility and Third Promissory Note. The pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our liquidity and has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth each line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations expressed as a percentage of net sales (1):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue </td> <td>101.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>101.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of merchandise sold </td> <td>73.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>73.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>(0.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(1)Table may not foot, due to rounding.\nFiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018\nNet Sales\nThe following table sets forth net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,219,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,257,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38,020) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales percent decrease: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable store sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales include customer purchases from our stores as well as online orders. Our online operation fulfills online orders from vendors and/or our warehouse. Store sales include online orders that are fulfilled and shipped or picked up from our stores. All online sales, regardless of fulfillment channel are referred to as omnichannel sales. The 3.0 percent decrease in net sales reflects lower comparable store sales and fewer stores for 2019. The 1.4 percent decrease in comparable stores sales, on an owned plus licensed basis, was primarily driven by a decrease in the number of transactions, with slight increases in units per transaction and average unit retail dollars. Omnichannel sales increased 11.0 percent in 2019.\nOther Revenue\nThe following table sets forth other revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,761 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in other revenue is the result of higher penetration from our growing credit card program, which has increased royalty, breakage and bounty income, partially offset by higher accrual of customer loyalty points.\nGross Profit\nThe following table compares gross profit for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,219,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,257,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38,020) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of merchandise sold </td> <td>901,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>919,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,767) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>318,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>337,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,253) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe lower gross profit rate in 2019 primarily reflects higher markdowns as a percent of sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table compares SG&A for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>336,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>348,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,102) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in SG&A expenses includes lower store-related expenses, including the impact of closed stores, lower incentive-based compensation expense, lower impairment charges and the benefit from a Visa/MasterCard claim settlement received in 2019. These items were slightly offset by higher advertising expenses for planned additional branded television, the impact of last year's change in vacation policy, and $1.6 million of costs incurred in 2019 related to the Merger Agreement that was terminated subsequent to year-end.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe following table compares interest expense for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,771) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net sales </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower average debt amounts compared to last year.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table compares income tax expense for fiscal 2019 to income tax benefit for fiscal 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>673 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates, reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns, adjusted for the effect of permanent differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in both periods presented above due to a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on the weight of all available evidence. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was driven by state income taxes, permanent differences and a limitation of available credits.\nSubsequent to February 1, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") was enacted in March 2020 that allows the carry back of net operating losses to prior years. Accordingly, the Company filed amended income tax returns for a net income tax refund of $2.9 million with the IRS and utilized $0.9 million of the tax credit carryforwards in our amended income tax returns.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds, available cash, credit terms from vendors, our $240.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to our amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank and our $35.0 million Term Loan (as discussed below). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent temporary store closures, our revenues, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to pay vendors and landlords according to standard terms have been materially adversely impacted. As a result, our management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. Although having a going concern note in our financial statements is an Event of default under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, we have obtained waivers of such defaults as described in further detail below. We are actively negotiating with vendors and landlords regarding restructuring payment of unpaid accounts payable and rent, but there is no assurance those discussions will be successful. We are also actively exploring additional sources of financing to provide us with additional liquidity and other strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company. However, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Equipment Term Loan\nOn February 3, 2015, we entered into a $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank ( Wells Fargo\u201d) with an original maturity of February 2020 (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a secured $25.0 million master loan agreement with Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. (the Equipment Term Loan\u201d) with an original maturity of February 2018. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were initially used for a special dividend but are subsequently being used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. During 2015, debt issuance costs of $0.4 million were associated with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Equipment Term Loan. Debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Agreement were being amortized over its respective term. We repaid the Equipment Term Loan in full on January 22, 2018, at which time the associated debt issuance costs were fully amortized.\nOn February 19, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, an Accommodation Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement Amendment) during which we were not required to meet the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). This change permitted us to borrow the full amount of the then-applicable borrowing base until we delivered our financial statements for the Measurement Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ended February 28, 2018. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment, a Cash Dominion Event (as defined in the Credit Agreement Amendment) occurred as of the effective date of the Credit Agreement Amendment and at all times thereafter. Because of the Cash Dominion Event, all of our cash receipts were swept daily to repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement was classified as a short-term obligation. As noted below, the Third Credit Agreement Amendment removed the Cash Dominion Event effective September 18, 2018.\nOn March 14, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Second Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, the following: (1) the $25.0 million Tranche A-1 Revolving Loans (as defined in the Second Credit Agreement Amendment) were repaid in full with the proceeds of the Term Loan (as defined below); (2) the entry into the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below); and (3) certain other modifications and updates to coordinate the Revolving Credit Facility with the Term Loan.\nOn September 18, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the Third Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Third Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, the following: (1) the increase of Aggregate Tranche A Revolving Loan Commitments (as defined in the Second Credit Agreement Amendment) from $225.0 million to $240.0 million; (2) an extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to the earlier of (a) the maturity date of the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) or (b) September 18, 2023; and (3) the elimination of Cash Dominion Event status and a change in Cash Dominion to be triggered only in the event of (a) the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default or (b) Excess Availability of less than (A) 10.0% of the loan cap at any time or (B) 12.5% of the loan cap for three consecutive business days. During 2018, debt issuance costs of less than $0.1 million were associated with the Third Credit Agreement Amendment and are being amortized over its term. Debt issuance costs of $0.1 million remaining under the initial Credit Agreement are being amortized over the new term of the Third Credit Agreement Amendment. The elimination of cash dominion status changed the debt classification from a short-term to long-term obligation.\nOn February 26, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 4 (the Fourth Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Fourth Credit Agreement Amendment provided for, among other things, a modification to the definition of Capital Expenditures\u201d and Permitted Indebtedness\u201d as defined in the Fourth Credit Agreement Amendment.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including the requirement of a 1.0 to 1.0 consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Covenant Compliance Event, as defined in the Credit Agreement), and events of default for facilities of this type and is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted. Collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility consists of substantially all of our personal property. Wells Fargo has a first lien on all collateral other than equipment. Wells Fargo is entitled to receive an Early Termination Fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in the event the Credit Agreement is terminated prior to September 18, 2023.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are either base rate loans or London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) loans. LIBOR loans bear interest equal to the adjusted LIBOR plus the applicable margin (125 to 175 basis points), depending on the quarterly average excess availability. Base Rate Loans bear interest equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 percent, (b) the adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00 percent, or (c) the Wells Fargo prime rate,\u201d plus the applicable margin (25 to 75 basis points).\nThe weighted average interest rate for the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement was 3.29 percent as of February 1, 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, due to the financial and operating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain Events of Default occurred that were subsequently waived on June 11, 2020, when we entered into Amendment No. 5 (the \"Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. The Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment provides for, among other things, the waiver of certain Events of Default and the modification of certain provisions of the Credit Agreement subject to the conditions set forth in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. The Events of Default, which include the presence of a going concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020, are further defined under Specified Defaults in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. See Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our going concern evaluation. Due to the uncertainties concerning the Company's future liquidity and on-going covenant compliance as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, the amount outstanding under our Credit Facilities will be classified as a current obligation in the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter 2020.\nPursuant to the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, a Cash Dominion Event, as defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, occurred as of the effective date of such amendment through and including the first anniversary of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, and at all times thereafter unless certain conditions are met, as further set forth in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. As a result of the Cash Dominion Event, all of our cash receipts are swept daily to repay borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures in September 2023; however, as a result of the Cash Dominion Event, the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement is considered a short-term obligation as of the amendment date until the conditions to remedy the Cash Dominion Event have occurred, as defined, but not before the first anniversary of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment. We manage our cash on a daily basis and borrow against the Credit Agreement based on our daily cash disbursement needs. As long as we remain within the terms of the Credit Agreement, the lenders are obligated to allow us to draw up to our borrowing availability.\nThe Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment revised the definition of Excess Availability to exclude past-due payables that are greater than sixty (60) days past due, and added a financial covenant requiring minimum Excess Availability equal to the greater of (i) five percent (5%) of the Combined Loan Cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) $10,000,000 during the Accommodation Period, which is defined as the date of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment through and including October 3, 2020 (the Accommodation Period\u201d), and thereafter requiring minimum Excess Availability equal to the greater of (i) ten percent (10%) of the Combined Loan Cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) $20,000,000. Additionally, the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment added a definition for Liquidity (as defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment), which includes, in addition to Excess Availability (less required minimum Excess Availability), amounts available in Blocked Accounts (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and amounts available for borrowing under the Trust (as defined below) and further provided for our provision of a Budget (as defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment) to Wells Fargo. Additional Events of Default under the Credit Agreement include (i) certain material deviations from the Budget calculated on a rolling 4-week basis, (ii) certain material deviations from the Budget on a rolling basis, which can be less than 4 weeks if we have failed to maintain Liquidity of $12.5 million, and (iii) failure to maintain Liquidity of $7.5 million.\nAs a result of the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, LIBOR loans bear interest equal to the adjusted LIBOR plus the applicable margin (175 to 225 basis points) depending on the quarterly average excess availability for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Base Rate Loans bear interest equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 percent, (b) the adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00 percent, or (c) the Wells Fargo prime rate,\u201d plus the Applicable Margin (75 to 125 basis points). The Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment provides that during the Accommodation Period, the applicable margin will be 225 and 125 for LIBOR loans and Base Rate Loans, respectively. See the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment for further discussion.\nAs a prerequisite to obtaining the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment, we are required to pay $2.5 million, pursuant to a payment plan, for outstanding accounts payable factored by Wells Fargo Trade Capital Services.\nThe Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment also added or amended certain definitions and terms including the LIBOR Replacement and Benchmark Transition Event, Accelerated Borrowing Base Weekly Delivery Event, Early Termination Fee, and certain financial covenants, all of which are defined in the Fifth Credit Agreement Amendment.\nTerm Loan\nOn March 14, 2018, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Gordon Brothers Finance Company, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Term Loan Agent\u201d), and Gordon Brothers Finance Company, LLC, as lender (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d). The Term Loan Agreement provided for a term loan in the amount of $50.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d). Debt issuance costs associated with the Term Loan were capitalized in the amount of $0.9 million and are being amortized over the term of the Term Loan. The net proceeds of $49.1 million from the Term Loan were used to permanently pay off the $25.0 million Tranche A-1 Revolving Loan (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and to pay"}
