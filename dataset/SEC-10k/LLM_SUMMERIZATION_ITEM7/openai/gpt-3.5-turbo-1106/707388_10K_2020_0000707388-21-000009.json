Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth previously under the caption Risk Factors.\u201d This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nExecutive Overview\nThe year 2020 marked the first full year that Star Equity, known prior to January 1, 2021 as Digirad Corporation, operated as a multi-industry holding company. With the acquisition of ATRM Holdings in September 2019, we added building and construction businesses to what had historically been a healthcare company and thereby transformed the Company into a diversified holding company with operating businesses in two important industry sectors of the economy, healthcare and building & construction.\nOur healthcare business, which is operated as Digirad Health, provides products and services in the area of nuclear imaging with a focus on cardiac health. Digirad Health operates across the U.S. The business involves two reporting segments, Diagnostic Services, which offers imaging services to healthcare providers using a fleet of our proprietary solid-state gamma cameras and Diagnostic Imaging, which manufactures, distributes and maintains our proprietary solid-state gamma cameras.\nOur Building & Construction business is a single reporting segment and operates as KBS, EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook. KBS is based in Maine and provides modular buildings throughout the New England market. EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook, referred to together as EBGL internally and based in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area, together provide structural wall panels and other engineered wood-based products, as well as building materials to customers in the Upper Midwest.\nCurrently, our real estate and investments segment is an internally-focused division, referred to internally as SRE, that is directly managed by Star Equity holding company management. The entity directly owns our three manufacturing facilities in Maine, which are leased to KBS.\nCurrent Market Conditions\nThe year 2020 proved to be a challenging year for the vast majority of businesses across many sectors of the economy. While the second half of the year offered hope that we will gradually make our way back to pre-COVID levels of business activity, we are still in the initial phases of the vaccine rollout. This presents continued uncertainty, which we believe will decrease as we move through 2021. On the healthcare side, we expect to see imaging volume recover as the pandemic is brought under control. In building & construction, we expect that continued recovery in employment and a strong housing market will underpin the growth we are seeing.\nThe target market for our healthcare products and services is comprised of cardiologists, internal medicine physicians, family practice physicians, hospitals, IDNs, and federal institutions in the United States that perform or could perform a diagnostic imaging procedure, have a need for cardiac event monitoring, or have interest in purchasing a diagnostic imaging product. During the year ended December 31, 2020, through Diagnostic Services, we provided imaging services to 584 physicians, physician groups, hospitals, IDNs and federal institutions. Our Diagnostic Services businesses currently operate in approximately 25 states. The overriding challenge during 2020 was the drop in imaging volume due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we provide critical and important imaging services focused in the cardiac area, the risks of exposure led to reduced patient volumes as these tests were deferred or canceled in hopes that the pandemic would abate.\nThe target market for our building and construction division includes residential home builders, general contractors, owners/developers of commercial buildings, and individual retail customers. While we witnessed a number of municipalities, especially in the Boston area, shutdown construction sites during the early wave of infections and even shutdown our own plant in South Paris, Maine for six weeks in April and May of 2020, housing demand and demand for building materials have increased as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to nesting\u201d at home, which have been positive factors in the second half of 2020. The challenge has been less on the demand side and more on the supply chain, as wood-based commodities prices, lumber and OSB, have increased rapidly coming out of the first wave of the pandemic in the Spring of 2020 and supply has not kept up with demand. We have seen some supply chain disruption and tightness during the second half of 2020 and that has continued into 2021 as lead times have extended out, but we are still able to operate at normal levels of production. We believe that the high price environment that we are currently experiencing will lead to additional supply coming on line going forward.\nTrends and Drivers\nThe market for diagnostic services and products is highly competitive. Our business, which is focused primarily on the private practice and hospital sectors, continues to face uncertainty in the demand for diagnostic services and imaging equipment, which we believe is due in part to the impact of the Deficit Reduction Act on the reimbursement environment and the 2010 Healthcare Reform laws, COVID-19 pandemic impact, as well as general uncertainty in overall healthcare and legislative changes in healthcare, such as the Affordable Care Act. These challenges have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our operations. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include budget availability for our capital equipment, qualifications for reimbursement, pricing, ease-of-use, reliability, and mobility.\nIn the area of reimbursements, our market has been negatively affected in the past by lower reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) and third-party insurance providers for the codes under which our customers bill for our services, although reimbursements have stabilized in the last several years. We have addressed, and will continue to address, these market pressures by modifying our Diagnostic Services business models, and by assisting our healthcare customers in complying with new regulations and requirements.\nIn our Star Building & Construction division, we continue to see a greater adoption of offsite or prefab construction in single-family and multi-family residential building projects, our target market. Our modular units and structural wall panels offer builders a number of benefits over traditional onsite or stick built\u201d construction. These include shorter time to market, higher quality, reduced waste, readily available labor and potential cost savings, among others. 3D BIM software modeling and developments in engineered wood products offers greater design flexibility for higher-end applications. The need for more affordable housing solutions also presents a great opportunity for the continued emergence of factory built housing.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, a global pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. Governmental authorities in the states in which we operate issued social distancing orders, which orders have required businesses in subject jurisdictions to cease non-essential operations at physical locations in those locations, unless exempted, rescinded, or amended. Accordingly, to comply with applicable regulations and to safeguard the health and safety of our employees and customers, we have temporarily modified our business operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we experienced an $12.4 million decrease in the Digirad Health revenue compared to 2019 related to a decrease in our diagnostic services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was offset by a $17.6 million increase respectively, in Building and Construction revenue, as compared to the same period of the prior year. As the COVID-19 pandemic affected the results of segments of our business during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we took steps to contain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nOn April 1, 2020, we announced that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Matthew G. Molchan, our then President and Chief Executive Officer, David J. Noble, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and Martin B. Shirley, the president of our Diagnostic Imaging Solutions Inc. subsidiary, had each agreed to have their base salaries reduced by 20%. These reductions were effective as of April 6, 2020, and remained in effect until May 15, 2020.\nOn April 1, 2020, we also announced that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we planned to furlough certain employees and that we would institute a 20% salary reduction for most of our salaried employees and reduce the number of working hours of most of our hourly employees by 20%. These reductions, which applied to our Digirad Health division, were effective as of April 6, 2020, and remained in effect until May 15, 2020. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our building and construction division has furloughed employees or reduced employee hours based on fluctuations in demand for our products. In September, 2020, KBS brought back furloughed employees and increased its work force by over 20% to meet the higher manufacturing requirements for two commercial projects as well as the future growth we expect.\nThis partial disruption, although expected to be temporary, may impact our operations and overall business. The impact of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly and its future effects are uncertain. Given the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration of the disruption and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As a result of the evolving impact of COVID-19 on the economy, on April 7, 2020, we withdrew our 2020 full-year guidance. At Star Equity, our highest priority remains the safety, health and well-being of our employees, their families and our communities and we remain committed to serving the needs of our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic is a highly fluid situation and it is not currently possible for us to reasonably estimate the impact it may have on our financial and operating results. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business as we learn more and the impact of COVID-19 on our industry becomes clearer.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn October 30, 2020, we entered into the DMS Purchase Agreement for the DMS Sale Transaction. The purchase price for the DMS Sale Transaction is $18.75 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, including a working capital adjustment. We deem the contemplated disposition of the Mobile Healthcare business unit to represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As of December 31, 2020, in accordance with the provisions of FASB authoritative guidance, the Mobile Healthcare business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. This segment is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as discontinued operations and on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Assets and Liabilities held for sale.\nPrior to December 31, 2020 we operated in five reportable segments, which included three in our healthcare business, known as Digirad Health. These included Diagnostic Services, Diagnostic Imaging, and Mobile Healthcare. We now have two reportable segments in continuing operations for the healthcare business going forward, Diagnostic Service and Diagnostic Imaging. For additional details related to the Company's reportable segments, see Item I. Business - Business Segments and Note 17. Segments within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOur building & construction segment, called Star Building & Construction, arose upon completion of the ATRM Merger in September of 2019, and 2020 is the first full-year that its operations will be reflected in our financials.\n2020 Financial Highlights\nAs noted above, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we reclassified our Mobile Healthcare segment to assets held for sale and discontinued operations. When held for sale criteria have been met, revenue, expenses, depreciation and amortization of those assets is suspended and the profits and losses are presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations. The operating results presented below are segregated between continuing operations and discontinued operations. Results from prior year comparative period have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. In addition, we would note that 2020 was the first full year in which we owned the Building & Construction businesses as they were acquired in September 2019 and financials in the prior year were only inclusive of that stub period in 2019.\nRevenues for continuing operations were $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This is an increase of $5.2 million, or 7.2%, compared to the prior year due to the following:\n\u2022The increase was mainly due to $17.6 million revenue generated by the Building and Construction segment and offset by the following reasons.\n\u2022Diagnostic Imaging segment revenue decreased $3.9 million, or 28.2%, primarily due to decrease in the number of cameras sold, reflecting COVID-19 impact.\n\u2022Diagnostic Services segment revenue decreased $8.5 million, or 17.7%, primarily due to decrease in scanning service performed, reflecting COVID-19 impact.\nGross profit from continuing operations decreased by $3.2 million, or 18.5%, compared to the prior year, mainly due to a $5.2 million decrease in the Diagnostic Imaging and Diagnostic Services segments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in Building and Construction gross profit, as we owned this business for the entire year in 2020. Additionally, we experienced lower health insurance expenses year over year, which was partially offset by higher lease expenses from an increase in sublease revenue and operating leases.\nTotal operating expenses increased $2.1 million, or 11.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional $3.0 million sales, marketing and general and administrative expenses, $1.3 million of amortization expenses and a $0.4 million goodwill impairment from the building and construction segment, which were mainly offset by a $2.3 million savings in merger and acquisition expenses.\nNet loss for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.3 million, which is an increase of $2.5 million compared to our net loss of $2.7 million during the prior year. This was driven primarily by additional net loss of $2.7 million in the Star Building & Construction division during the year ended December 31, 2020, despite a $0.2 million increase in net income from the Digirad Health division. As a result of the recent acquisition of the Building & Construction businesses, we are experiencing a considerable increase in the amortization of intangibles in our income statement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Diagnostic Services operated 90 nuclear gamma cameras and 46 ultrasound imaging systems. We measure efficiency by tracking system utilization, which is based on the percentage of days that our cameras, equipment and imaging systems are used to deliver services to customers out of the total number of days that they are available to deliver such services. System utilization for Diagnostic Services for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 59% compared to 60% of the prior year.\nUse of EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure)\nManagement believes EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of the Company's performance that provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA is also considered by management as an indicator of operating performance and the most comparable measure across the regions in which we operate. Management also uses this measurement to evaluate capital needs and working capital requirements. Similar to constant currency, EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company's profitability. Because of these and other limitations, EBITDA should be considered along with GAAP based financial performance measures, including operating income or net income prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is derived from net (loss) income adjusted for the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, interest expense (income), and depreciation and amortization.\nThe reconciliation of EBITDA from continuing operations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided in the table below:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Moreover, we experienced an increase in KBS activity levels and recognized $4.3 million of revenue on two large commercial projects, as we re-entered the commercial market in 2020.\nReal Estate and Investments\nReal estate and investments revenue is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Real Estate and Investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Real Estate and Investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in real estate and investments revenue was due to the wind down of investment vehicles from LSVM.

While management proactively applied measures to contain costs during the pandemic, there were fixed costs which resulted in the decrease in gross margin.\nStar Building & Construction\nStar Building & Construction gross profit and margin is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building and Construction gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building and Construction gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in building and construction gross profit is mainly due to the fact that 2020 includes a full year of operational data from this segment as compared to a portion of the year in 2019 and increased revenue from KBS' two large commercial projects. Gross profit of our Star Building & Construction business for Q4 2020 decreased by 12.8%, from prior year same period, due to the negative effect of higher raw material prices.\nStar Real Estate & Investments\nStar Real Estate & Investments gross profit and margin is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate and Investments gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(209) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(226) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate and Investments gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td>(401.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(275.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStar Real Estate & Investments manages three manufacturing facilities which it leases to KBS and investment vehicles through LSVM. Its negative gross profit relates to depreciation expense and the write-off of some of the assets included with the three manufacturing facilities acquired in April 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expense are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Revenues </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets </td> <td>2,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and financing costs </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,342) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating expenses increased $2.1 million, or 11.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The increase was due in part to the additional $3.0 million sales, marketing and general and administrative expenses from the building and construction segment. We also recognized an additional $1.3 million in amortization of intangibles and a $0.4 million write-down of goodwill. Much of the total increase in operating expenses was offset by $2.3 million worth of savings in merger and acquisition expenses. We also experienced a $0.3 million savings in sales and general and administrative expenses in the healthcare segments.\nThe $1.3 million increase in amortization of intangible assets was primarily due to $19.5 million of additional intangible assets related to the ATRM Acquisition on September 10, 2019.\nGoodwill non-cash impairment charges increased by $0.4 million compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of an impairment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2020 in our EBGL reporting unit. See Note 9. Goodwill, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTotal other income (expense) is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(133) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>(1,292) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(746) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(151) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,030) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income was generated from $2.5 million in partial forgiveness on PPP Loans taken during 2020 (see Note 10. Debt within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements), the settlement of an aged Massachusetts sales and use tax payable at KBS and the settlement of legacy legal costs at ATRM, the immediate parent of our Building & Construction businesses, as well as unrealized gains from equity securities.\nThe increase in interest expense comes from additional acquired debt in the Building & Construction business, despite a significant reduction in interest rates on the substantial portion of our total debt which is based on a floating rate.\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2019, is related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the termination of our prior revolving credit facility with Comerica on March 29, 2019. See Note 10. Debt, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nIntraperiod allocation rules require us to allocate our provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories or comprehensive income (loss) such as discontinued operations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, a tax provision of $0.1 million and tax benefit of $0.2 million were recorded in continuing operations, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a tax expense of $22 thousand to discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a benefit of $0.1 million to discontinued operations. As described in Note 4. Discontinued Operations, the results of our Mobile Healthcare reportable segment have been reported as discontinued operations for the current and prior year.\nSee Note 14. Income Taxes, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nAs described in Note 4. Discontinued Operations, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, the results of our mobile healthcare reportable segment have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $5.0 million, as compared to $0.4 million of net cash generated from operating activities in 2019, resulting in an increase in net cash used in operating activities of $5.5 million. The increase in net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from working capital investments made in our Building & Construction businesses during 2020, principally into KBS, as well as a higher net loss caused by reduced revenues due to the COVID-19 impact on our businesses, particularly on our Digirad Health division.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 million, as compared to $5.8 million of net cash used by investing activities in 2019. The $4.5 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects a return to normalized capital expenditure as we had paid $5.2 million in 2019 to acquire the three factories from KBS prior to purchasing the full Building & Construction business later that year when we closed the acquisition of ATRM.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash generated from financing activities was $8.1 million, as compared to net cash generated from financing activities of $5.7 million in 2019, resulting in an increase in net cash generated from financing activities of $2.4 million. The increase was attributable to proceeds from the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) loan of $6.7 million in late April and early May and net proceeds from our common stock offering of $5.2 million in late May, partially offset by a $3.2 million net reduction in principal on existing debt.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,953) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,332) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,818) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,666 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources of Liquidity\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and availability on our revolving lines of credit from our credit facility with Sterling National Bank, our three credit facilities with Gerber Finance, Inc and one credit facility with Premier. As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as approximately $7.3 million in undrawn capacity on our $20.0 million Sterling National Bank revolving line of credit. The Gerber facilities directly support our Building & Construction businesses. As of December 31, 2020, we were fully drawn in terms of available capacity at $1.1 million on the KBS revolver and $2.0 million on the EBGL revolver. However, those facilities have loan limits of $4.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, and we expect to be able to use more of that availability as our borrowing base increases with higher production levels.\nLiquidity Outlook\nWe require capital, principally for capital expenditures, acquisition activity, dividend payments and to finance accounts receivable and inventory. Our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on inventory requirements, the timing of deliveries, and the payment cycles of our customers. Our capital expenditures consist of medical imaging and diagnostic devices utilized in the provision of our services, as well as vehicles and information technology hardware and software. In addition, we are putting in place capital expenditure programs in the Building & Construction business in order to improve operations and expand our production output. Generally, this business is not capital intensive, although we had to augment working capital significantly in 2020, especially at KBS, to support higher production levels.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of obligations in the normal course of business. We incurred net losses from continuing operations of approximately $7.2 million and $1.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $125.0 million and $118.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash used in operations of $5.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided by operations of $0.4 million for the same prior year period in 2019. The Company will need to secure additional future financing to accomplish its business plan over the next several years and that there can be no assurance on the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital mat be available in the future.\nRegarding our debt, GAAP rules require us to classify $18.4 million as short-term debt, as of December 31, 2020. However, $12.7 million of our debt allocation to short-term relates to the balance on our revolving line of credit with Sterling. This debt primarily supports our healthcare business and the SNB Loan Agreement actually matures in 2024, but GAAP rules require that the outstanding balance be classified as short-term debt, due to the automatic sweep feature embedded in the traditional lockbox arrangement along with a subjective acceleration clause in the agreement. In practice, we have the ability to immediately borrow back these daily sweeps to fund our working capital.\nAn additional $3.1 million of revolver debt supporting our Building & Construction businesses is classified as short-term debt. This includes the $2.0 million and $1.1 million balances on our Gerber revolvers at EBGL and KBS, respectively. These credit facilities each have an automatic annual renewal features. The remaining $2.5 million of our short-term debt includes $1.9 million worth of a PPP loan, which is expected to be forgiven within 2021, as well as $0.6 million representing the current portion of a long-term term loan. Although we were in breach of certain debt covenants on the Building & Construction revolvers, Gerber delivered waivers and we are not in default on this or any other portions of our debt.\nFurther, the short-term classification of the SNB revolver is a technical GAAP presentation requirement given the traditional lockbox arrangement. The revolver directly supports our healthcare business, but may be drawn to fund non-healthcare operations as long as we maintain a $4 million cushion of excess availability following any non-healthcare distributions. As of December 31, 2020 we had $7.3 million in excess availability on the SNB revolver and were in compliance with all covenants related to this facility, as further discussed in Note 10. Debt, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements below.\nAdditional short-term related-party debt is held by Mr. Eberwein, our Executive Chairman, totaling approximately $2.3 million at December 31, 2020. Mr. Eberwein has committed to provide financial support to the Company by providing written assurances that he will (1) extend and not force repayment of this debt, which was due October 2020, until five business days after the closing date of the DMS Sale Transaction, the date when the Note is no longer subject to a certain subordinate letter agreement with Gerber, or to June 30, 2022.; and (2) extend through June 2021 the Company's put option with him with respect to $1.0 million in Company Preferred Stock. See Note 16. Related Party Transactions, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, for information regarding the financial support provided by Mr. Eberwein. We expect to fully payoff this debt from proceeds generated upon the closing of the DMS sale.\nManagement believes that we have the liquidity and operations to continue to support the business through the next 12 months from the issuance of this Annual Report. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our plans.\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn May 28, 2020, we closed a public offering (the Offering\u201d) of 2,225,000 shares of our common stock, and 2,225,000 warrants (the Warrants\u201d) to purchase up to 1,112,500 additional shares of our common stock. The Offering price was $2.24 per share of common stock and $0.01 per accompanying Warrant (for a combined Offering price of $2.25), initially raising $5.0 million in gross proceeds before underwriter discounts and offering-related expenses. The underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement\u201d) we entered into with Maxim Group LLC ( Maxim\u201d), as representative of the underwriters, for the Offering contained customary representations, warranties, and agreements by the Company, customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the Company and Maxim and certain other obligations.\nPursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted to Maxim an option for a period of 45 days (the Over-Allotment Option\u201d) to purchase up to 225,000 additional shares of our common stock and 225,000 Warrants to purchase up to an additional 112,500 shares of our common stock. Effective as of the closing of the Offering, Maxim exercised the Over-Allotment Option for the purchase of 225,000 Warrants for a price of $0.01 per Warrant. On June 10, 2020, Maxim exercised the Over-Allotment Option for the purchase of 225,000 shares of our common stock for a price of $2.24 per share, before underwriting discounts. The closing of the sale of the over-allotment shares brought the total number of shares of common stock we sold in the Offering to 2,450,000 shares, and total gross proceeds to approximately $5.5 million. In addition, the Company received $0.5 million from investors in the Offering throughout the balance of 2020 due to the exercise of a portion of the Warrants sold in the Offering, bringing the total gross proceeds from equity issuance to $6.0 million.\nThe net proceeds to the Company from the Offering and Warrant exercises in 2020 were approximately $5.2 million (inclusive of the exercise of the over-allotment option), after deducting underwriter fees and offering-related expenses estimated at $0.8 million. We used a significant portion of the net proceeds from the Offering to fund working capital needs at our Building & Construction businesses, particularly related to modular housing projects which we produced at KBS for the for Boston-area projects. The remainder of the net proceeds is being used for working capital and for other general corporate purposes. We have broad discretion in determining how the proceeds of the Offering is used, and our discretion is not limited by the aforementioned possible uses.\nCredit Facilities\nSterling Credit Facility\nOn March 29, 2019, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the SNB Loan Agreement\u201d) by and among certain subsidiaries of the Company, as borrowers (collectively, the SNB Borrowers\u201d); the Company, as guarantor; and Sterling National Bank, a national banking association, as lender ( Sterling\u201d or SNB\u201d).\nThe SNB Loan Agreement is a five-year credit facility maturing in March 2024, with a maximum credit amount of $20.0 million for revolving loans (the SNB Credit Facility\u201d). Under the SNB Credit Facility, the SNB Borrowers can request the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $0.5 million at any one time outstanding. The borrowings under the SNB Loan Agreement were classified as short-term obligations under GAAP as the agreement contained a subjective acceleration clause and required a lockbox arrangement whereby all receipts are swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $0.2 million of letters of credit outstanding and had additional borrowing capacity of $7.3 million.\nAt the Borrowers' option, the SNB Credit Facility will bear interest at either (i) a Floating LIBOR Rate, as defined in the Loan Agreement, plus a margin of 2.50% per annum; or (ii) a Fixed LIBOR Rate, as defined in the Loan Agreement, plus a margin of 2.25% per annum. As our largest single debt outstanding, our floating rate on this facility at the end of 2020 was 2.64%.\nThe Company used a portion of the financing made available under the SNB Credit Facility to refinance and terminate, effective as of March 29, 2019, its previous credit facility with Comerica.\nThe SNB Loan Agreement includes certain representations, warranties of SNB Borrowers, as well as events of default and certain affirmative and negative covenants by the SNB Borrowers that are customary for loan agreements of this type. These covenants include restrictions on borrowings, investments and dispositions by SNB Borrowers, as well as limitations on the SNB Borrowers' ability to make certain distributions. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the SNB Loan Agreement, SNB may, among other things, declare the loans and all other obligations under the SNB Loan Agreement immediately due and payable and increase the interest rate at which loans and obligations under the SNB Loan Agreement bear interest. The SNB Credit Facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the SNB Borrowers and a pledge of all shares of the SNB Borrowers.\nOn March 29, 2019, in connection with the Company's entry into the SNB Loan Agreement, Jeffery E. Eberwein, the Executive Chairman of the Company's board of directors, entered into Limited Guaranty Agreement (the SNB Eberwein Guaranty\u201d) with SNB pursuant to which he guaranteed to SNB the prompt performance of all the Borrowers' obligations to SNB under the SNB Loan Agreement, including the full payment of all indebtedness owing by Borrowers to SNB under or in connection with the SNB Loan Agreement and related SNB Credit Facility documents. Mr. Eberwein's obligations under the SNB Eberwein Guaranty are limited in the aggregate to the amount of (a) $1.5 million, plus (b) reasonable costs and expenses of SNB incurred in connection with the SNB Eberwein Guaranty. Mr. Eberwein's obligations under the SNB Eberwein Guaranty terminate upon the Company and Borrowers achieving certain milestones set forth therein.\nIn connection with the SNB Credit Facility, in the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a $0.2 million loss on extinguishment due to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior revolving credit facility with Comerica.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\nOn February 1, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the SNB Loan Agreement, which is described in more detail in Note 19. Subsequent Events, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nATRM Loan Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2020, ATRM had outstanding revolving lines of credit of approximately $3.1 million. Our debt through ATRM primarily included (i) $1.1 million principal outstanding on KBS's $4.0 million revolving credit facility under a Loan and Security Agreement, dated February 23, 2016, (as amended, the KBS Loan Agreement\u201d), with Gerber Finance Inc. ( Gerber\u201d) and (ii) $2.0 million principal outstanding on EBGL's $3.0 million revolving credit facility under a Revolving Credit Loan Agreement, dated June 30, 2017 (as amended, the Premier Loan Agreement\u201d) with Premier Bank ( Premier\u201d), net of an immaterial amount of unamortized financing fees. As of December 31, 2020, ATRM was at the maximum borrowing capacity under both revolving lines of credit, based on the inventory and accounts receivable on that day which fluctuates weekly.\nSee Note 16. Related Party Transactions, for information regarding certain ATRM promissory notes that are outstanding.\nKBS Loan Agreement\nOn February 23, 2016, ATRM, KBS and Main Modular Haulers, Inc. (a subsidiary of ATRM) entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the KBS Loan Agreement\u201d) with Gerber. The KBS Loan Agreement provides KBS with a revolving line of credit with borrowing availability of up to $4.0 million. Availability under the line of credit is based on a formula tied to KBS's eligible accounts receivable, inventory and other collateral. The KBS Loan Agreement, which was scheduled to expire on February 22, 2018, has been automatically extended for successive one (1) year periods in accordance with its terms and is now scheduled to expire on February 22, 2022. The KBS Loan Agreement will be automatically extended for another one (1) year period unless a party thereto provides prior written notice of termination. As of December 31, 2020, neither party has provided notice of termination. Upon the final expiration of the term of the KBS Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance is payable in full. Borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus 2.75%, equating to 6.00% at December 31, 2020, with interest payable monthly. The KBS Loan Agreement also provides for certain fees payable to Gerber during its term, including a 1.5% annual facilities fee and a 0.10% monthly collateral monitoring fee. KBS's obligations under the KBS Loan Agreement are secured by all of its assets and are guaranteed by ATRM. Unsecured promissory notes issued by KBS and ATRM are subordinate to KBS's obligations under the KBS Loan Agreement. The KBS Loan Agreement contains representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, defined events of default and other provisions customary for financings of this type. Financial covenants require that KBS maintain a maximum leverage ratio (as defined in the KBS Loan Agreement) and KBS not incur a net annual post-tax loss in any fiscal year during the term of the KBS Loan Agreement. The borrowings under the KBS Loan Agreement were classified as short-term obligations under GAAP as the agreement contained a subjective acceleration clause and required a lockbox arrangement whereby all receipts are swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding. At December 31, 2020, approximately $1.1 million was outstanding under the KBS Loan Agreement.\nThe parties to the KBS Loan Agreement have amended the KBS Loan Agreement to provide for increased availability under the KBS Loan Agreement to KBS under certain circumstances, including for new equipment additions, and certain other changes, as well as a waiver of certain covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, KBS was not in compliance with the financial covenants requiring no net annual post-tax loss for KBS or the minimum leverage ratio covenant as of 2020. The occurrence of any event of default under the KBS Loan Agreement may result in KBS's obligations under the KBS Loan Agreement becoming immediately due and payable. In April 2019, June 2019, February 2020 and February 2021, we obtained a waiver from Gerber for these events.\nOn September 10, 2019, the parties of the KBS Loan Agreement entered into a Consent and Acknowledgment Agreement and Twelfth Amendment to Loan Agreement (the Twelfth Amendment\u201d), by and among Gerber, KBS, ATRM and the Company, pursuant to which the Company agreed to guarantee amounts borrowed by certain ATRM's subsidiaries from Gerber. The Twelfth Amendment requires the Company to serve as an additional guarantor with the existing guarantor, ATRM, with respect to the payment, performance and discharge of each and every obligation of payment and performance by the borrowing subsidiaries with respect to the loans made by Gerber to them. The Twelfth Amendment also provides that upon payment in full of the EBGL Obligations (as defined therein), the amount of the Cash Collateral (as defined therein) will be reduced to $0.3 million. Additionally, ATRM had on deposit $0.2 million in a collateral account maintained with Gerber to secure the loans under the KBS Loan Agreement which was returned to ATRM in November 2019.\nOn January 31, 2020, the Company, ATRM, KBS and Gerber entered into a Thirteenth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Thirteenth KBS Loan Amendment\u201d) to amend the terms of the KBS Loan Agreement, in order to, among other things (a) amend the definitions of Ancillary Credit Parties,\u201d Guarantor,\u201d Obligations,\u201d and Subordinated Lender\u201d to address the obligations of the Star Borrowers, the EBGL Borrowers, the Star Credit Parties, and the EBGL Credit Parties under the Star Loan Agreement, EBGL Loan Agreement and the Subordination Agreements (each as defined below) to which they are a party and (b) add a new cross default provision.\nOn March 5, 2020, in connection with the First EBGL Amendment, Gerber, KBS, ATRM and the Company entered into a Consent and as a Fourteenth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement that amended the KBS Loan Agreement (the Consent and Fourteenth Amendment\u201d). Under the terms of the Consent and Fourteenth Amendment, the parties thereto (and the subordinated creditors that consented thereto) consented to the First EBGL Amendment and agreed that cash collateral would no longer be part of the borrowing base and that the borrowing base would no longer be based on cash availability for purposes of the KBS Loan Agreement.\nOn April 1, 2020, Gerber and KBS entered into a Fifteenth Amendment to Loan Agreement (the Fifteenth Amendment\u201d) pursuant to which the Minimum Average Monthly Loan Amount\u201d under the KBS Loan Agreement was decreased to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Maximum Revolving Amount (as defined in the KBS Loan Agreement).\nOn January 5, 2021, Gerber and KBS entered into a Sixteenth Amendment to Loan Agreement (the Sixteenth Amendment\u201d). The Sixteenth Amendment changed certain definitions under the KBS Loan Agreement to increase the inventory assets against which funds can be borrowed.\nOn February 26, 2021 Gerber and KBS entered into a Seventeenth Amendment to Loan Agreement (the Seventeenth Amendment\u201d). The Seventeenth Amendment provided the waiver to the 2020 covenant breach and amended the financial covenants. The financial covenants under the KBS Loan Agreement, as amended, provide that (i) KBS shall make no distribution, transfer, payment, advance, or contribution of cash or property which would constitute a restricted payment; (ii) KBS shall report annual post-tax net income at least equal to (a) $385 thousand for the trailing 6-month period ending June 30, 2021 and b) $500 thousand for the trailing fiscal year end December 31, 2021; and (iii) a minimum EBITDA at June 30, 2021 of more than $880 thousand or at December 31, 2021 of more than $1.5 million.\nEBGL Premier Note\nOn June 30, 2017, EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook (together, EBGL) entered into a Revolving Credit Loan Agreement (as amended, the Premier Loan Agreement\u201d) with Premier providing EBGL with a working capital line of credit of up to $3.0 million. The Premier Loan Agreement replaced the prior revolving credit facility under a loan and security agreement with Gerber (the EBGL Loan Agreement\u201d), which was terminated on the same date and all obligations of EBGL and ATRM in favor of Gerber in connection with the EBGL Loan Agreement were extinguished.\nAvailability under the Premier Loan Agreement is based on a formula tied to EBGL's eligible accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus 1.50%, with interest payable monthly and the outstanding principal balance payable upon expiration of the term of the Premier Loan Agreement. The Premier Loan Agreement also provides for certain fees payable to Premier during its term. The initial term of the Premier Loan Agreement was scheduled to expire on June 30, 2018, but was extended multiple times by Premier through January 31, 2023. The Premier Loan Agreement may be further extended from time to time at our request, subject to approval by Premier. EBGL's obligations under the Premier Loan Agreement are secured by all of their inventory, equipment, accounts and other intangibles, fixtures and all proceeds of the foregoing.\nOn January 31, 2020, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of the Star Loan Agreement and EBGL Loan Agreement described below, Glenbrook and EdgeBuilder entered into an Extension and Modification Agreement (the Modification Agreement\u201d) with Premier that modified the terms of the Revolving Credit Promissory Note (the Premier Note\u201d) made by Glenbrook and EdgeBuilder pursuant to the Premier Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement, the amount of indebtedness evidenced by the Premier Note was reduced to $1.0 million, and the Premier Note was modified to, among other things: (a) extend the Final Maturity Date (as defined in the Premier Note) of the Premier Note to January 31, 2023, and (b) set the interest that the Premier Note will bear at 5.75% per annum. As a condition to close and to then later extend the term of the Premier Loan Agreement, ATRM and Mr. Eberwein executed a guaranty in favor of Premier, which has, through the multiple extensions described above, been extended through January 1, 2023, under which ATRM and Mr. Eberwein have absolutely and unconditionally guaranteed all of EBGL's obligations under the Premier Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $0.7 million was outstanding under the Premier Loan Agreement.\nGerber Star and EBGL Loans\nOn January 31, 2020, SRE, 947 Waterford Road, LLC ( 947 Waterford\u201d), 300 Park Street, LLC ( 300 Park\u201d), and 56 Mechanic Falls Road, LLC ( 56 Mechanic\u201d and together with SRE, 947 Waterford, and 300 Park, (the Star Borrowers\u201d), each an Investments Subsidiary, and the Company, ATRM, KBS, EdgeBuilder, and Glenbrook (collectively, the Star Credit Parties\u201d), entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the Star Loan Agreement\u201d) with Gerber providing the Star Borrowers with a credit facility with borrowing availability of up to $2.5 million ($2.0 million and $0.5 million to KBS and EBGL, respectively) (the Star Loan\u201d). The advance of $2.0 million to KBS is to be repaid in monthly installments of sixty (60) consecutive equal payments. The advance of $0.5 million to EBGL, which has been temporarily increased by $0.3 million due to be repaid on April 30, 2020, is to be repaid in monthly installments of twelve (12) consecutive equal payments. On February 20, 2020, the Star Borrowers entered into a First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the First Star Amendment\u201d) with Gerber that amended the Star Loan Agreement in order to (i) temporarily advance $0.3 million to EBGL, which amount is to be repaid to Gerber on or before April 30, 2020; (ii) clarify that Gerber can make multiple advances under the Star Loan Agreement, and (iii) to correct the maturity date of the Star Loan. On April 30, 2020, the Star Borrowers entered into a Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Second Star Amendment\u201d) with Gerber that amended the Star Loan Agreement in order to change terms of repayment for the advance of $0.3 million to EBGL provided for under the First Star Amendment. Under the terms of the Second Star Amendment, the advance of $0.3 million to EBGL is to be repaid in three (3) consecutive equal monthly installments on the thirtieth (30th) day in each calendar month, commencing May 30, 2020, and in a final installment on or before July 31, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, EBGL repaid $0.3 million to Gerber. As of December 31, 2020, $1.6 million was outstanding under the Star Loan Agreement.\nOn January 31, 2020, EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook (the EBGL Borrowers\u201d), each a Construction Subsidiary, and the Company, Star, 947 Waterford, 300 Park, 56 Mechanic, ATRM, and KBS (collectively, the EBGL Credit Parties\u201d), entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the EBGL Loan Agreement\u201d) with Gerber providing the EBGL Borrowers with a credit facility with borrowing availability of up to $3.0 million (the EBGL Loan\u201d).\nOn March 5, 2020, the EBGL Borrowers entered into a First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the First EBGL Amendment\u201d) with Gerber that amended the EBGL Loan Agreement and the KBS Loan Agreement in order to, among other things, include a pledge $0.3 million of cash collateral by LSVI under the EBGL Loan Agreement which, prior to the First EBGL Amendment, was pledged by LSVI in connection with the KBS Loan Agreement. On July 1, 2020, the EBGL Borrowers entered into a Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement that amended the EBGL Loan Agreement in order to, among other things, terminate the pledge of $0.3 million in cash collateral. On February 26, 2021, the EBGL Borrowers entered into a third amendment to the EBGL Loan Agreement (the Third EBGL Amendment\u201d) pursuant to which the Company and Gerber agreed to, among other things, eliminate the minimum leverage ratio covenant, lower the minimum EBITDA, and require the borrowers to not incur a net operating loss on bi-annual basis. The Third EBGL Amendment also discharged the EBGL Eberwein Guaranty (described below) and removed Mr. Eberwein as an ancillary guarantor from the EBGL Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2020 , $2.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nAvailability under the Star Loan Agreement is based on a formula tied to the value of real estate owned by the Star Borrowers, and borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus 3.5% per annum. Availability under the EBGL Loan Agreement is based on a formula tied to the EBGL Borrowers' eligible accounts receivable and inventory, and borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus 2.75% per annum. The Loan Agreements also provide for certain fees payable to Gerber during their respective terms. The Star Loan matures on the earlier of (a) January 1, 2025 or (b) the termination, the maturity or repayment of the EBGL Loan. The EBGL Loan matures on the earlier of (a) January 1, 2022, unless extended, or (b) the termination, the maturity or repayment of the Star Loan. The maturity of the EBGL Loan is automatically extended for successive periods of one (1) year each unless terminated by Gerber or the EBGL Borrowers. The borrowings under the EBGL Loan Agreement were classified as short-term obligations under GAAP as the agreement contained a subjective acceleration clause and required a lockbox arrangement whereby all receipts are swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding.\nThe obligations of the EBGL Borrowers under the EBGL Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the EBGL Credit Parties and are secured by substantially all the assets of the EBGL Borrowers and the EBGL Credit Parties.\nThe obligations of the Star Borrowers under the Star Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the Star Credit Parties and are secured by substantially all the assets of the Star Borrowers and the Star Credit Parties. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of the Star Loan Agreement, Jeffrey E. Eberwein, the Executive Chairman of the Company's board of directors, executed and delivered a Guaranty (the Gerber Eberwein Guaranty\u201d) to Gerber pursuant to which he guaranteed the performance of all the Star Borrowers' obligations to Gerber under the Star Loan Agreement, including the full payment of all indebtedness owing by the Star Borrowers to Gerber under or in connection with the Star Loan Agreement and related financing documents. Mr. Eberwein's obligations under the Gerber Eberwein Guaranty are limited in the aggregate to the amount of (a) $2.5 million, plus (b) costs of Gerber incidental to the enforcement of the Gerber Eberwein Guaranty or any guaranteed obligations. On March 5, 2020, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of the First EBGL Amendment, Mr. Eberwein, the Executive Chairman of the Company's board of directors, executed and delivered a Guaranty (the EBGL Eberwein Guaranty\u201d) to Gerber pursuant to which he guaranteed the performance of all the EBGL Borrowers' obligations to Gerber under the EBGL Loan Agreement, including the full payment of all indebtedness owing by the EBGL Borrowers to Gerber under or in connection with the EBGL Loan Agreement and related financing documents. Mr. Eberwein's obligations under the EBGL Eberwein Guaranty are limited in the aggregate to the amount of (a) $0.5 million, plus (b) costs of Gerber incidental to the enforcement of the EBGL Eberwein Guaranty or any guaranteed obligations.\nOn February 26, 2021, the Star Borrowers entered into a third amendment to the Star Loan Agreement (the Third Star Amendment\u201d) with Gerber that, among other things, amended the contract rate to prime rate plus 3% and discharged the $2.5 million Gerber Eberwein Guaranty.\nThe Star Loan Agreement and EBGL Loan Agreement contains representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and other provisions customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants under the EBGL Loan Agreement applicable to the EBGL Borrowers include maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum debt service coverage ratio and minimum net income. The Financial covenants under the Star Loan Agreement applicable to the Star Borrowers include a minimum debt service coverage ratio. The occurrence of any event of default under the Loan Agreements may result in the obligations of the Borrowers becoming immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2020, EBGL was not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Star Loan Agreement and EBGL Loan Agreement as of 2020. The occurrence of any event of default under the EBGL Loan Agreement may result in EBGL's obligations under the EBGL Loan Agreement becoming immediately due and payable. In February 2021, we obtained a waiver from Gerber for these events and, as part of the Third EBGL Amendment (described above), the Company and Gerber agreed to, among other things, eliminate the minimum leverage ratio covenant, lower the minimum EBITDA, and require the borrowers to not incur a net operating loss on bi-annual basis, as well as discharge the EBGL Eberwein Guaranty.\nAs a condition to the extension of credit to the Star Borrowers and EBGL Borrowers under the Star Loan Agreement and EBGL Loan Agreement, the holders of certain existing unsecured promissory notes made by ATRM and certain of its subsidiaries entered into subordination agreements (the Subordination Agreements\u201d) with Gerber pursuant to which such noteholders (including the Company and certain of its subsidiaries) agreed to subordinate the obligations of ATRM and its subsidiaries to such noteholders to the obligations of the Star Borrowers and EBGL Borrowers to Gerber under the loan agreements.\nPaycheck Protection Program\nOn April 30, 2020, each of KBS, EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook executed a separate promissory note evidencing unsecured loans under the Paycheck Protection Program\u201d (the PPP\u201d). The promissory note executed by KBS is for $0.8 million (the KBS Note\u201d), the promissory note executed by EdgeBuilder is for $0.2 million (the EdgeBuilder Note\u201d) and the promissory note executed by Glenbrook is for $0.2 million (the Glenbrook Note\u201d). The KBS Note, the EdgeBuilder Note and the Glenbrook Note, each dated April 30, 2020, are referred to together as the Construction Notes\u201d.\nOn May 11, 2020, the Company and each of Digirad Imaging Solutions, Inc. ( DIS\u201d), DMS Imaging, Inc. ( DMS Imaging\u201d) and DMS Health Technologies, Inc. ( DMS Health\u201d), each a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, executed a separate promissory note evidencing unsecured loans under the PPP. The promissory note executed by the Company, dated May 7, 2020, is for $0.8 million (the Company Note\u201d); the promissory note executed by DIS, dated May 5, 2020, is for $3.0 million (the DIS Note\u201d); the promissory note executed by DMS Imaging, dated May 5, 2020, is for $1.6 million (the DMS Imaging Note\u201d) and the promissory note executed by DMS Health, dated May 7, 2020, is for $0.1 million (the DMS Health Note\u201d). The Company Note, the DIS Note, the DMS Imaging Note, and the DMS Health Note are referred to together as the Healthcare Notes\u201d. The Construction Notes and the Healthcare Notes are referred to collectively as the PPP Notes\u201d and each promissory note individually as a PPP Note\u201d. As of December 31, 2020, the $1.6 million DMS Imaging Note, the $0.1 million DMS Health Note, and the $0.8 million Company Note were forgiven. In first quarter 2021, $0.4 million of the Glenbrook Note and EdgeBuilder Note, and $0.8 million of the KBS Note were forgiven; therefore, the DIS Loan is the only PPP Note that remains outstanding.\nThe PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d). The loans evidenced by the Construction Notes are being made through Bremer Bank ( Bremer\u201d) as lender, and the loans evidenced by the Healthcare Notes are being made through Sterling as lender.\nThe loans evidenced by the PPP Notes (the PPP Loans\u201d) have two-year terms and bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum. Monthly principal and interest payments under the PPP Loans are deferred for ten months after the end of covered periods. Beginning eleven months from the date of a PPP Note, unless fully forgiven prior thereto, the applicable borrower will pay to its lender thereunder a monthly principal and interest payments. The PPP Loans may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. The Construction Notes mature on April 30, 2022, and the Healthcare Notes mature two years from the date the loans under the Healthcare Notes are disbursed. Loans under the Company Note and the DIS Note were disbursed on May 12, 2020, and the loans under the DMS Health Note and DMS Imaging Note were disbursed on May 13, 2020.\nThe PPP Notes contain customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false and misleading representations to the SBA or lender, or breaching the terms of the applicable PPP Loan documents. Upon an event of default under a PPP Note, the lender thereunder may, among other things, require immediate payment of all amounts owing under the applicable PPP Note, collect all amounts owing from the applicable borrower, or file suit and obtain judgment.\nUnder the terms of the CARES Act, recipients of loans under the PPP can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and certain other eligible costs. However, no assurance is provided that forgiveness for any portion of the PPP Loans will be obtained and even if forgiveness is granted the PPP Loans may remain subject to review and audit due to all affiliated PPP Notes equaling more than $2 million.\nIn order to apply for the PPP Loans, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loans request necessary to support ongoing operations of the Company. This certification further required the Company to take into account its current business activity and its ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. The Company is continuing to evaluate the criteria and new guidance put out by the SBA regarding loan forgiveness and the procedures to seek loan forgiveness. As of December 31, 2020, $2.5 million of the Company Note, DMS Imaging Note and DMS Health Note were forgiven and in first Quarter 2021, an additional $1.2 million of the KBS Note, Glenbrook Note, and EdgeBuilder Note were forgiven. The Company has sought full loan forgiveness from the SBA for the DIS Note based on the satisfaction of applicable criteria and guidelines and is currently undergoing the mandated audit for all PPP loans over $2 million. PPP Loan forgiveness is sought under the belief that all entities requesting loan forgiveness have met the stated criteria and guidelines provided by the SBA and terms of the CARES Act; however, no assurance can be provided that forgiveness of the rest of PPP Loans will be obtained.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn September 10, 2019, the parties to the KBS Loan Agreement entered a Consent and Acknowledgment Agreement and Twelfth Amendment to Loan Agreement, by and among Gerber, KBS, ATRM and the Company, pursuant to which the Company agreed to guarantee amounts borrowed by certain of ATRM's subsidiaries from Gerber. The Twelfth Amendment requires the Company to serve as an additional guarantor with the existing guarantor, ATRM, with respect to the payment, performance and discharge of each and every obligation of payment and performance by the borrowing subsidiaries with respect to the loans made by Gerber to them. On January 31, 2020, the Company, ATRM, KBS and Gerber entered into a Thirteenth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Thirteenth KBS Loan Amendment\u201d) to amend the KBS Loan Agreement, by and among the Company, ATRM, KBS and Gerber, in order to, among other things (a) amend the definitions of Ancillary Credit Parties,\u201d Guarantor,\u201d Obligations,\u201d and Subordinated Lender\u201d to address the obligations of the Star Borrowers, the EBGL Borrowers, the Star Credit Parties, and the EBGL Credit Parties under the Loan Agreements and the Subordination Agreements to which they are a party and (b) add a new cross default provision.\nSee Note 10. Debt, within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, the most critical of which are those related to business combination, revenue recognition, goodwill valuation, and income taxes. Furthermore, the impact on accounting estimates and judgements on the Company's financial condition and results of operations due to COVID-19 has introduced additional uncertainties. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we reclassified our Mobile Healthcare segment to assets held for sale. Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the assets; (2) the assets are available for immediate sale, in their present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of such assets; (3) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets have been initiated; (4) the sale of the assets is probable and is expected to completed within one year; (5) the assets are being actively marketed for a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value; and (6) actions required to complete he plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the assets (and liabilities) are classified as held for sale in the balance sheet for the current and comparative reporting periods. Assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation and amortization of assets ceases upon designation as held for sale. The assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale, respectively. The profits and losses are presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations for the current and prior periods.\nBusiness Combination\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The fair values assigned, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants, are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. We record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, as goodwill. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nIn connection with certain of our acquisitions, additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones. In these cases, a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable inputs such as anticipated future cash flows, risk-free adjusted discount rates, and nonperformance risk. Any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized as general and administrative expense (income), in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. This method requires significant management judgment, including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates. Future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains.\nManagement typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets. This method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors. The estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.\nSee Trends and Drivers-Acquisition of ATRM Holdings, Inc.\u201d above for a description of the ATRM Acquisition.\nRevenue Recognition\nPursuant to ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. We record the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nRevenue recognition is evaluated on a contract basis. Performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if we have an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin. Determining if an enforceable right to payment includes a reasonable profit margin requires judgment and is assessed on a contract by contract basis. For contracts requiring over time revenue recognition, the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We use a cost-based input measurement of progress because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, which occurs as costs are incurred during the manufacturing process or as services are rendered. Under the cost-based measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the costs incurred to date.\nGoodwill valuation\nWe review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We begin the process by assessing qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. After performing the aforementioned assessment and upon review of the results of such assessment, we may begin performing impairment analysis by quantitatively comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. Impairment charge for goodwill is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and such loss should not exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe Company recorded goodwill of $8.2 million associated with the acquisition of ATRM during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company recorded a goodwill impairment of $0.4 million for EBGL during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 9. Goodwill, for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will expire before we are able to realize their benefit. We calculate the valuation allowance in accordance with the authoritative guidance relating to income taxes, which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.\nThe authoritative guidance for income taxes defines a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax provision taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The guidance also provides direction on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Under the guidance, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3.

The company operates in healthcare and building & construction industries. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected their healthcare business, leading to reductions in diagnostic services and imaging equipment revenue. However, their building and construction business experienced an increase in revenue due to higher activity levels and large commercial projects. The company also made strategic changes, including furloughs and salary reductions in response to the pandemic. Additionally, the report presents financial highlights, including revenues, gross profit, and operating expenses in the different segments. It also provides financial analysis using non-GAAP measures like EBITDA. Furthermore, the report discusses discontinued operations and strategic shifts in the company's activities.", "item_7_tables": "Table 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth previously under the caption Risk Factors.\u201d This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nExecutive Overview\nThe year 2020 marked the first full year that Star Equity, known prior to January 1, 2021 as Digirad Corporation, operated as a multi-industry holding company. With the acquisition of ATRM Holdings in September 2019, we added building and construction businesses to what had historically been a healthcare company and thereby transformed the Company into a diversified holding company with operating businesses in two important industry sectors of the economy, healthcare and building & construction.\nOur healthcare business, which is operated as Digirad Health, provides products and services in the area of nuclear imaging with a focus on cardiac health. Digirad Health operates across the U.S. The business involves two reporting segments, Diagnostic Services, which offers imaging services to healthcare providers using a fleet of our proprietary solid-state gamma cameras and Diagnostic Imaging, which manufactures, distributes and maintains our proprietary solid-state gamma cameras.\nOur Building & Construction business is a single reporting segment and operates as KBS, EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook. KBS is based in Maine and provides modular buildings throughout the New England market. EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook, referred to together as EBGL internally and based in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area, together provide structural wall panels and other engineered wood-based products, as well as building materials to customers in the Upper Midwest.\nCurrently, our real estate and investments segment is an internally-focused division, referred to internally as SRE, that is directly managed by Star Equity holding company management. The entity directly owns our three manufacturing facilities in Maine, which are leased to KBS.\nCurrent Market Conditions\nThe year 2020 proved to be a challenging year for the vast majority of businesses across many sectors of the economy. While the second half of the year offered hope that we will gradually make our way back to pre-COVID levels of business activity, we are still in the initial phases of the vaccine rollout. This presents continued uncertainty, which we believe will decrease as we move through 2021. On the healthcare side, we expect to see imaging volume recover as the pandemic is brought under control. In building & construction, we expect that continued recovery in employment and a strong housing market will underpin the growth we are seeing.\nThe target market for our healthcare products and services is comprised of cardiologists, internal medicine physicians, family practice physicians, hospitals, IDNs, and federal institutions in the United States that perform or could perform a diagnostic imaging procedure, have a need for cardiac event monitoring, or have interest in purchasing a diagnostic imaging product. During the year ended December 31, 2020, through Diagnostic Services, we provided imaging services to 584 physicians, physician groups, hospitals, IDNs and federal institutions. Our Diagnostic Services businesses currently operate in approximately 25 states. The overriding challenge during 2020 was the drop in imaging volume due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we provide critical and important imaging services focused in the cardiac area, the risks of exposure led to reduced patient volumes as these tests were deferred or canceled in hopes that the pandemic would abate.\nThe target market for our building and construction division includes residential home builders, general contractors, owners/developers of commercial buildings, and individual retail customers. While we witnessed a number of municipalities, especially in the Boston area, shutdown construction sites during the early wave of infections and even shutdown our own plant in South Paris, Maine for six weeks in April and May of 2020, housing demand and demand for building materials have increased as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to nesting\u201d at home, which have been positive factors in the second half of 2020. The challenge has been less on the demand side and more on the supply chain, as wood-based commodities prices, lumber and OSB, have increased rapidly coming out of the first wave of the pandemic in the Spring of 2020 and supply has not kept up with demand. We have seen some supply chain disruption and tightness during the second half of 2020 and that has continued into 2021 as lead times have extended out, but we are still able to operate at normal levels of production. We believe that the high price environment that we are currently experiencing will lead to additional supply coming on line going forward.\nTrends and Drivers\nThe market for diagnostic services and products is highly competitive. Our business, which is focused primarily on the private practice and hospital sectors, continues to face uncertainty in the demand for diagnostic services and imaging equipment, which we believe is due in part to the impact of the Deficit Reduction Act on the reimbursement environment and the 2010 Healthcare Reform laws, COVID-19 pandemic impact, as well as general uncertainty in overall healthcare and legislative changes in healthcare, such as the Affordable Care Act. These challenges have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our operations. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include budget availability for our capital equipment, qualifications for reimbursement, pricing, ease-of-use, reliability, and mobility.\nIn the area of reimbursements, our market has been negatively affected in the past by lower reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) and third-party insurance providers for the codes under which our customers bill for our services, although reimbursements have stabilized in the last several years. We have addressed, and will continue to address, these market pressures by modifying our Diagnostic Services business models, and by assisting our healthcare customers in complying with new regulations and requirements.\nIn our Star Building & Construction division, we continue to see a greater adoption of offsite or prefab construction in single-family and multi-family residential building projects, our target market. Our modular units and structural wall panels offer builders a number of benefits over traditional onsite or stick built\u201d construction. These include shorter time to market, higher quality, reduced waste, readily available labor and potential cost savings, among others. 3D BIM software modeling and developments in engineered wood products offers greater design flexibility for higher-end applications. The need for more affordable housing solutions also presents a great opportunity for the continued emergence of factory built housing.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, a global pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. Governmental authorities in the states in which we operate issued social distancing orders, which orders have required businesses in subject jurisdictions to cease non-essential operations at physical locations in those locations, unless exempted, rescinded, or amended. Accordingly, to comply with applicable regulations and to safeguard the health and safety of our employees and customers, we have temporarily modified our business operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we experienced an $12.4 million decrease in the Digirad Health revenue compared to 2019 related to a decrease in our diagnostic services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was offset by a $17.6 million increase respectively, in Building and Construction revenue, as compared to the same period of the prior year. As the COVID-19 pandemic affected the results of segments of our business during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we took steps to contain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nOn April 1, 2020, we announced that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Matthew G. Molchan, our then President and Chief Executive Officer, David J. Noble, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and Martin B. Shirley, the president of our Diagnostic Imaging Solutions Inc. subsidiary, had each agreed to have their base salaries reduced by 20%. These reductions were effective as of April 6, 2020, and remained in effect until May 15, 2020.\nOn April 1, 2020, we also announced that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we planned to furlough certain employees and that we would institute a 20% salary reduction for most of our salaried employees and reduce the number of working hours of most of our hourly employees by 20%. These reductions, which applied to our Digirad Health division, were effective as of April 6, 2020, and remained in effect until May 15, 2020. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our building and construction division has furloughed employees or reduced employee hours based on fluctuations in demand for our products. In September, 2020, KBS brought back furloughed employees and increased its work force by over 20% to meet the higher manufacturing requirements for two commercial projects as well as the future growth we expect.\nThis partial disruption, although expected to be temporary, may impact our operations and overall business. The impact of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly and its future effects are uncertain. Given the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration of the disruption and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As a result of the evolving impact of COVID-19 on the economy, on April 7, 2020, we withdrew our 2020 full-year guidance. At Star Equity, our highest priority remains the safety, health and well-being of our employees, their families and our communities and we remain committed to serving the needs of our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic is a highly fluid situation and it is not currently possible for us to reasonably estimate the impact it may have on our financial and operating results. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business as we learn more and the impact of COVID-19 on our industry becomes clearer.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn October 30, 2020, we entered into the DMS Purchase Agreement for the DMS Sale Transaction. The purchase price for the DMS Sale Transaction is $18.75 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, including a working capital adjustment. We deem the contemplated disposition of the Mobile Healthcare business unit to represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As of December 31, 2020, in accordance with the provisions of FASB authoritative guidance, the Mobile Healthcare business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. This segment is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as discontinued operations and on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Assets and Liabilities held for sale.\nPrior to December 31, 2020 we operated in five reportable segments, which included three in our healthcare business, known as Digirad Health. These included Diagnostic Services, Diagnostic Imaging, and Mobile Healthcare. We now have two reportable segments in continuing operations for the healthcare business going forward, Diagnostic Service and Diagnostic Imaging. For additional details related to the Company's reportable segments, see Item I. Business - Business Segments and Note 17. Segments within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOur building & construction segment, called Star Building & Construction, arose upon completion of the ATRM Merger in September of 2019, and 2020 is the first full-year that its operations will be reflected in our financials.\n2020 Financial Highlights\nAs noted above, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we reclassified our Mobile Healthcare segment to assets held for sale and discontinued operations. When held for sale criteria have been met, revenue, expenses, depreciation and amortization of those assets is suspended and the profits and losses are presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations. The operating results presented below are segregated between continuing operations and discontinued operations. Results from prior year comparative period have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. In addition, we would note that 2020 was the first full year in which we owned the Building & Construction businesses as they were acquired in September 2019 and financials in the prior year were only inclusive of that stub period in 2019.\nRevenues for continuing operations were $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This is an increase of $5.2 million, or 7.2%, compared to the prior year due to the following:\n\u2022The increase was mainly due to $17.6 million revenue generated by the Building and Construction segment and offset by the following reasons.\n\u2022Diagnostic Imaging segment revenue decreased $3.9 million, or 28.2%, primarily due to decrease in the number of cameras sold, reflecting COVID-19 impact.\n\u2022Diagnostic Services segment revenue decreased $8.5 million, or 17.7%, primarily due to decrease in scanning service performed, reflecting COVID-19 impact.\nGross profit from continuing operations decreased by $3.2 million, or 18.5%, compared to the prior year, mainly due to a $5.2 million decrease in the Diagnostic Imaging and Diagnostic Services segments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in Building and Construction gross profit, as we owned this business for the entire year in 2020. Additionally, we experienced lower health insurance expenses year over year, which was partially offset by higher lease expenses from an increase in sublease revenue and operating leases.\nTotal operating expenses increased $2.1 million, or 11.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional $3.0 million sales, marketing and general and administrative expenses, $1.3 million of amortization expenses and a $0.4 million goodwill impairment from the building and construction segment, which were mainly offset by a $2.3 million savings in merger and acquisition expenses.\nNet loss for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.3 million, which is an increase of $2.5 million compared to our net loss of $2.7 million during the prior year. This was driven primarily by additional net loss of $2.7 million in the Star Building & Construction division during the year ended December 31, 2020, despite a $0.2 million increase in net income from the Digirad Health division. As a result of the recent acquisition of the Building & Construction businesses, we are experiencing a considerable increase in the amortization of intangibles in our income statement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Diagnostic Services operated 90 nuclear gamma cameras and 46 ultrasound imaging systems. We measure efficiency by tracking system utilization, which is based on the percentage of days that our cameras, equipment and imaging systems are used to deliver services to customers out of the total number of days that they are available to deliver such services. System utilization for Diagnostic Services for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 59% compared to 60% of the prior year.\nUse of EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure)\nManagement believes EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of the Company's performance that provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA is also considered by management as an indicator of operating performance and the most comparable measure across the regions in which we operate. Management also uses this measurement to evaluate capital needs and working capital requirements. Similar to constant currency, EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company's profitability. Because of these and other limitations, EBITDA should be considered along with GAAP based financial performance measures, including operating income or net income prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is derived from net (loss) income adjusted for the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, interest expense (income), and depreciation and amortization.\nThe reconciliation of EBITDA from continuing operations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided in the table below:\n\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table sets forth our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nN/M Not meaningful\nMobile Healthcare segment revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and income tax are included in loss from discontinued operations. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations.\nRevenues\nHealthcare\nHealthcare revenue by segment is summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in Diagnostic Services and Diagnostic Imaging revenue was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact. Although many medical offices and facilities temporarily closed in mid-March, most are now open and many hospitals that stopped performing non-emergency procedures, tests, and scans slowly started to re-open and serve patients during the quarter, although at lower than pre-COVID-19 schedule.\nBuilding and Construction\nBuilding and construction revenue is summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in building and construction revenue was due to our ownership of the business for a full year, compared to one quarter and 20 days prior year same period. Moreover, we experienced an increase in KBS activity levels and recognized $4.3 million of revenue on two large commercial projects, as we re-entered the commercial market in 2020.\nReal Estate and Investments\nReal estate and investments revenue is summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in real estate and investments revenue was due to the wind down of investment vehicles from LSVM. Intercompany lease revenue from KBS for the three factories we own was eliminated through consolidation in the consolidated financial statements.\nGross Profit\nHealthcare\nHealthcare gross profit and gross margin is summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in Diagnostic Services and Diagnostic Imaging gross profit is mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact and the associated public health measures in place, which directly reduced scanning revenue and camera sales. While management proactively applied measures to contain costs during the pandemic, there were fixed costs which resulted in the decrease in gross margin.\nStar Building & Construction\nStar Building & Construction gross profit and margin is summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in building and construction gross profit is mainly due to the fact that 2020 includes a full year of operational data from this segment as compared to a portion of the year in 2019 and increased revenue from KBS' two large commercial projects. Gross profit of our Star Building & Construction business for Q4 2020 decreased by 12.8%, from prior year same period, due to the negative effect of higher raw material prices.\nStar Real Estate & Investments\nStar Real Estate & Investments gross profit and margin is summarized as follows (in thousands):\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth previously under the caption Risk Factors.\u201d This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nExecutive Overview\nThe year 2020 marked the first full year that Star Equity, known prior to January 1, 2021 as Digirad Corporation, operated as a multi-industry holding company. With the acquisition of ATRM Holdings in September 2019, we added building and construction businesses to what had historically been a healthcare company and thereby transformed the Company into a diversified holding company with operating businesses in two important industry sectors of the economy, healthcare and building & construction.\nOur healthcare business, which is operated as Digirad Health, provides products and services in the area of nuclear imaging with a focus on cardiac health. Digirad Health operates across the U.S. The business involves two reporting segments, Diagnostic Services, which offers imaging services to healthcare providers using a fleet of our proprietary solid-state gamma cameras and Diagnostic Imaging, which manufactures, distributes and maintains our proprietary solid-state gamma cameras.\nOur Building & Construction business is a single reporting segment and operates as KBS, EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook. KBS is based in Maine and provides modular buildings throughout the New England market. EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook, referred to together as EBGL internally and based in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area, together provide structural wall panels and other engineered wood-based products, as well as building materials to customers in the Upper Midwest.\nCurrently, our real estate and investments segment is an internally-focused division, referred to internally as SRE, that is directly managed by Star Equity holding company management. The entity directly owns our three manufacturing facilities in Maine, which are leased to KBS.\nCurrent Market Conditions\nThe year 2020 proved to be a challenging year for the vast majority of businesses across many sectors of the economy. While the second half of the year offered hope that we will gradually make our way back to pre-COVID levels of business activity, we are still in the initial phases of the vaccine rollout. This presents continued uncertainty, which we believe will decrease as we move through 2021. On the healthcare side, we expect to see imaging volume recover as the pandemic is brought under control. In building & construction, we expect that continued recovery in employment and a strong housing market will underpin the growth we are seeing.\nThe target market for our healthcare products and services is comprised of cardiologists, internal medicine physicians, family practice physicians, hospitals, IDNs, and federal institutions in the United States that perform or could perform a diagnostic imaging procedure, have a need for cardiac event monitoring, or have interest in purchasing a diagnostic imaging product. During the year ended December 31, 2020, through Diagnostic Services, we provided imaging services to 584 physicians, physician groups, hospitals, IDNs and federal institutions. Our Diagnostic Services businesses currently operate in approximately 25 states. The overriding challenge during 2020 was the drop in imaging volume due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we provide critical and important imaging services focused in the cardiac area, the risks of exposure led to reduced patient volumes as these tests were deferred or canceled in hopes that the pandemic would abate.\nThe target market for our building and construction division includes residential home builders, general contractors, owners/developers of commercial buildings, and individual retail customers. While we witnessed a number of municipalities, especially in the Boston area, shutdown construction sites during the early wave of infections and even shutdown our own plant in South Paris, Maine for six weeks in April and May of 2020, housing demand and demand for building materials have increased as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to nesting\u201d at home, which have been positive factors in the second half of 2020. The challenge has been less on the demand side and more on the supply chain, as wood-based commodities prices, lumber and OSB, have increased rapidly coming out of the first wave of the pandemic in the Spring of 2020 and supply has not kept up with demand. We have seen some supply chain disruption and tightness during the second half of 2020 and that has continued into 2021 as lead times have extended out, but we are still able to operate at normal levels of production. We believe that the high price environment that we are currently experiencing will lead to additional supply coming on line going forward.\nTrends and Drivers\nThe market for diagnostic services and products is highly competitive. Our business, which is focused primarily on the private practice and hospital sectors, continues to face uncertainty in the demand for diagnostic services and imaging equipment, which we believe is due in part to the impact of the Deficit Reduction Act on the reimbursement environment and the 2010 Healthcare Reform laws, COVID-19 pandemic impact, as well as general uncertainty in overall healthcare and legislative changes in healthcare, such as the Affordable Care Act. These challenges have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our operations. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include budget availability for our capital equipment, qualifications for reimbursement, pricing, ease-of-use, reliability, and mobility.\nIn the area of reimbursements, our market has been negatively affected in the past by lower reimbursements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) and third-party insurance providers for the codes under which our customers bill for our services, although reimbursements have stabilized in the last several years. We have addressed, and will continue to address, these market pressures by modifying our Diagnostic Services business models, and by assisting our healthcare customers in complying with new regulations and requirements.\nIn our Star Building & Construction division, we continue to see a greater adoption of offsite or prefab construction in single-family and multi-family residential building projects, our target market. Our modular units and structural wall panels offer builders a number of benefits over traditional onsite or stick built\u201d construction. These include shorter time to market, higher quality, reduced waste, readily available labor and potential cost savings, among others. 3D BIM software modeling and developments in engineered wood products offers greater design flexibility for higher-end applications. The need for more affordable housing solutions also presents a great opportunity for the continued emergence of factory built housing.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, a global pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. Governmental authorities in the states in which we operate issued social distancing orders, which orders have required businesses in subject jurisdictions to cease non-essential operations at physical locations in those locations, unless exempted, rescinded, or amended. Accordingly, to comply with applicable regulations and to safeguard the health and safety of our employees and customers, we have temporarily modified our business operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we experienced an $12.4 million decrease in the Digirad Health revenue compared to 2019 related to a decrease in our diagnostic services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was offset by a $17.6 million increase respectively, in Building and Construction revenue, as compared to the same period of the prior year.
