Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nCryoLife, Inc. ( CryoLife,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d or us\u201d) is a leader in the manufacturing, processing, and distribution of medical devices and implantable human tissues used in cardiac and vascular surgical procedures for patients with aortic disease. We have four major product families: BioGlue\u00ae Surgical Adhesive ( BioGlue\u201d) products, JOTEC stent grafts and surgical products, On-X mechanical heart valves and surgical products, and implantable cardiac and vascular human tissues. In addition to these four major product families, we sell or distribute PhotoFixTM bovine surgical patch, PerClot\u00ae hemostatic powder, NEXUSTM endovascular stent graft system, and CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 we reported record annual revenues of $276.2 million, increasing 5% over the prior year, largely due to an increase in revenues from On-X and preservation services. For the year ended December 31, 2019 we generated $15.8 million in cash flows from operations and reported a net income of $1.7 million. See the Results of Operations\u201d section below for additional analysis of the fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. See Part I, Item 1, Business,\u201d for further discussion of our business and activities during 2019.\nAgreements with Endospan\nOn September 11, 2019 CryoLife or its wholly-owned subsidiary, JOTEC, entered into exclusive distribution and loan agreements with Endospan Ltd. ( Endospan\u201d), an Israeli corporation, as well as a securities purchase option agreement to purchase Endospan. We paid Endospan $15.0 million in September 2019 related to these agreements.\nJOTEC entered into an exclusive distribution agreement ( Endospan Distribution Agreement\u201d) with Endospan, pursuant to which JOTEC obtained exclusive distribution rights for Endospan's NEXUS stent graft system ( NEXUS\u201d) and accessories in certain countries in Europe. In addition, CryoLife entered into a securities purchase option agreement ( Endospan Option Agreement\u201d) with Endospan which provides CryoLife the option to purchase all of the outstanding securities of Endospan from Endospan's securityholders at the time of the acquisition, or the option to acquire all of Endospan's assets, in each case, for a price between $350.0 and $450.0 million before, or within, a certain period of time after U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) approval of NEXUS, with such option expiring 90 days after receiving notice that Endospan has received approval from the FDA for NEXUS. Lastly, CryoLife and Endospan entered into a loan agreement ( Endospan Loan Agreement\u201d), in which CryoLife agreed to provide Endospan a secured loan to be funded in three tranches of $5.0 million each, of which the first tranche was funded in September of 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d We believe that the consistent application of these policies enables us to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require us to make estimates and assumptions. The following are accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis, including cash equivalents, and certain restricted securities. We may make an irrevocable election to measure other financial instruments at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Fair value financial instruments are recorded in accordance with the fair value measurement framework.\nWe also measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These non-recurring valuations include evaluating assets such as certain financial assets, long-lived assets, and non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment, allocating value to assets in an acquired asset group and applying accounting for business combinations. We use the fair value measurement framework to value these assets and report these fair values in the periods in which they are recorded or written down.\nThe fair value measurement framework includes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair values in their broad levels. These levels from highest to lowest priority are as follows:\n\uf0b7Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;\n\uf0b7Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and\n\uf0b7Level 3: Unobservable inputs or valuation techniques that are used when little or no market data is available.\nThe determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement's placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation methodologies applied to our unobservable estimates and assumptions. Our assumptions could vary depending on the asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include: estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. We may also engage external advisors to assist in determining fair value, as appropriate.\nAlthough we believe that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.\nDeferred Preservation Costs\nDeferred preservation costs include costs of cardiac and vascular tissues available for shipment, tissues currently in active processing, and tissues held in quarantine pending release to implantable status. By federal law, human tissues cannot be bought or sold; therefore, the tissues we preserve are not held as inventory. The costs we incur to procure and process cardiac and vascular tissues are instead accumulated and deferred. Deferred preservation costs are stated at the lower of cost or market value on a first-in, first-out basis and are deferred until revenue is recognized. Upon shipment of tissue to an implanting facility, revenue is recognized, and the related deferred preservation costs are expensed as cost of preservation services. Cost of preservation services also includes, as applicable, lower of cost or market write-downs and impairments for tissues not deemed to be recoverable, and includes, as incurred, idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, extra freight, and re-handling costs.\nThe calculation of deferred preservation costs involves judgment and complexity and uses the same principles as inventory costing. Donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ and tissue procurement organizations ( OPOs\u201d) and tissue banks that consign the tissue to us for processing, preservation, and distribution. Deferred preservation costs consist primarily of the procurement fees charged by the OPOs and tissue banks, direct labor and materials (including salary and fringe benefits, laboratory supplies and expenses, and freight-in charges), and indirect costs (including allocations of costs from support departments and facility allocations). Fixed production overhead costs are allocated based on actual tissue processing levels, to the extent that they are within the range of the facility's normal capacity.\nThese costs are then allocated among the tissues processed during the period based on cost drivers, such as the number of donors or number of tissues processed. We apply a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable. We estimate quarantine and in process yields based on our experience and reevaluate these estimates periodically. Actual yields could differ significantly from our estimates, which could result in a change in tissues available for shipment and could increase or decrease the balance of deferred preservation costs. These changes could result in additional cost of preservation services expense or could increase per tissue preservation costs, which would impact gross margins on tissue preservation services in future periods.\nWe regularly evaluate our deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value. We also evaluate our deferred preservation costs for costs not deemed to be recoverable, including tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of their packaging. Lower of cost or market value write-downs are recorded if the tissue processing costs incurred exceed the estimated market value of the tissue services, based on recent average service fees at the time of the evaluation. Impairment write-downs are recorded based on the book value of tissues deemed to be impaired. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Write-downs of deferred preservation costs are expensed as cost of preservation services, and these write-downs are permanent impairments that create a new cost basis, which cannot be restored to its previous levels if our estimates change.\nWe recorded write-downs to our deferred preservation costs totaling $787,000, $437,000, and $922,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, due primarily to tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of the packaging.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes. We periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, as necessary, when we experience changes that could materially affect our determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. We provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, as a result of this analysis, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nAssessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets involves judgment and complexity in conjunction with prudent and feasible tax planning. Estimates and judgments used in the determination of the need for a valuation allowance and in calculating the amount of a needed valuation allowance include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\uf0b7Projected future operating results;\n\uf0b7Anticipated future state tax apportionment;\n\uf0b7Timing and amounts of anticipated future taxable income;\n\uf0b7Timing of the anticipated reversal of book/tax temporary differences;\n\uf0b7Evaluation of statutory limits regarding usage of certain tax assets; and\n\uf0b7Evaluation of the statutory periods over which certain tax assets can be utilized.\nSignificant changes in the factors above, or other factors, could affect our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Such changes could have a material, adverse impact on our profitability, financial position, and cash flows. We will continue to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, as necessary, when we experience changes that could materially affect our prior determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets.\nWe believe that the realizability of our acquired net operating loss carryforwards will be limited in future periods due to a change in control of our former subsidiaries Hemosphere, Inc. ( Hemosphere\u201d) and Cardiogenesis Corporation ( Cardiogenesis\u201d), as mandated by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe that our acquisitions of these companies each constituted a change in control as defined in Section 382 and that, prior to our acquisition, Hemosphere had experienced other equity ownership changes that should be considered such a change in control. We also acquired net operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions in our recent acquisition of JOTEC. We believe these loss carryforwards will be fully realizable. The deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets exclude amounts that we expect will not be realizable due to changes in control. A portion of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards is related to state income taxes, for which we believe it is more likely than not, that some will not be realized. Therefore, we recorded a valuation allowance against these state net operating loss carryforwards.\nValuation of Acquired Assets or Businesses\nAs part of our corporate strategy, we are seeking to identify and capitalize upon acquisition opportunities of complementary product lines and companies. We evaluate and account for acquired patents, licenses, distribution rights, and other tangible or intangible assets as the purchase of an asset or asset group, or as a business combination, as appropriate. The determination of whether the purchase of a group of assets should be accounted for as an asset group or as a business combination requires judgment based on the weight of available evidence.\nFor the purchase of an asset group, we allocate the cost of the asset group, including transaction costs, to the individual assets purchased based on their relative estimated fair values. In-process research and development acquired as part of an asset group is expensed upon acquisition. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method. Under this method, the allocation of the purchase price is based on the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs related to a business combination are expensed as incurred. In-process research and development acquired as part of a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the related research and development project gains regulatory approval or is discontinued.\nWe typically engage external advisors to assist in determining the fair value of acquired asset groups or business combinations, using valuation methodologies such as: the excess earnings, the discounted cash flow, or the relief from royalty methods. The determination of fair value in accordance with the fair value measurement framework requires significant judgments and estimates, including, but not limited to: timing of product life cycles, estimates of future revenues, estimates of profitability for new or acquired products, cost estimates for new or changed manufacturing processes, estimates of the cost or timing of obtaining regulatory approvals, estimates of the success of competitive products, and discount rates. We, in consultation with our advisor(s), make these estimates based on our prior experiences and industry knowledge. We believe that our estimates are reasonable, but actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. A significant change in our estimates used to value acquired asset groups or business combinations could result in future write-downs of tangible or intangible assets acquired by us and could, therefore, materially impact our financial position and profitability. If the value of the liabilities assumed by us, including contingent liabilities, is determined to be significantly different from the amounts previously recorded in purchase accounting, we may need to record additional expenses or write-downs in future periods, which could materially impact our financial position and profitability.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further discussion of new accounting standards that have been adopted or are being evaluated for future adoption.\nResults of Operations\n(In

respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X product revenues and cardiac preservation services revenues. The increase in revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X product revenues and cardiac preservation services revenues, as well as BioGlue and JOTEC product revenues. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues increased 4% and 7% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. A detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues and preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 is presented below.\nProducts\nRevenues from products increased 2% and 5% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X product revenues. The increase in revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X, BioGlue, and JOTEC product revenues. A detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues for BioGlue, JOTEC, On-X, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, PerClot, and PhotoFix is presented below.\nSales of certain products through our direct sales force and distributors across Europe and various other countries are denominated in a variety of currencies, with a concentration denominated in Euros in addition to British Pounds, Polish Zlotys, Swiss Francs, Brazilian Reals, and Canadian Dollars which are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 the U.S. Dollar strengthened in comparison to major currencies, resulting in revenue decreases when these foreign currency denominated transactions were translated into U.S. Dollars. Future changes in these exchange rates could have a material, adverse effect on our revenues denominated in these currencies. Additionally, our sales to many distributors around the world are denominated in U.S. Dollars, and although these sales are not directly impacted by currency exchange rates, we believe that some of our distributors may delay or reduce purchases of products in U.S. Dollars depending on the relative price of these goods in their local currencies.\nBioGlue\nThe BioGlue product line is used as an adjunct to standard methods of achieving hemostasis (such as sutures and staples) in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels (such as aorta, femoral, and carotid arteries).\nRevenues from the sale of BioGlue decreased 1% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an impact of foreign exchange rates and a change in average sales prices, each of which decreased revenues by 1%, partially offset by a change in the mix of milliliters sold, which increased revenues by 1%. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues were flat for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenues from the sale of BioGlue increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 5% increase in the volume of milliliters sold, which increased revenues by 5%, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 1%, and a decrease in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 1%. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues increased 5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nExcluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues for BioGlue increased in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 in all international markets, with the largest growth in Asia Pacific for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and EEA, the Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) and Asia Pacific for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue in Asia Pacific is due to distributor buying patterns for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue in EMEA is due to an increase in direct sales during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increases in all international markets were partially offset by decreases in domestic markets during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nWe are currently seeking regulatory approval for BioGlue in China, and if this effort is successful, management believes this will provide an additional international growth opportunity for BioGlue in future years.\nDomestic BioGlue revenues accounted for 49% and 51% of total BioGlue revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and 50% and 53% of total BioGlue revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nJOTEC\nOn December 1, 2017 CryoLife acquired JOTEC AG and its subsidiaries (the JOTEC Acquisition\u201d), a Germany-based, developer of technologically differentiated endovascular stent grafts, and cardiac and vascular surgical grafts, focused on aortic repair. The JOTEC product line is used in endovascular and open vascular surgery, as well as for the treatment of complex aortic arch and thoracic aortic diseases.\nJOTEC revenues decreased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. JOTEC revenues increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nJOTEC revenues, excluding original equipment manufacturing ( OEM\u201d), were flat for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. The factors affecting revenue during this period include a change in mix of volume sold which increased revenues by 5%, offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 4%, and a change in average sales prices which decreased revenues 1%.\nJOTEC revenues, excluding OEM, increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase in revenues was primarily due to an 8% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 11%, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 6%, and a decrease in average sales price, which decreased revenues by 2%.\nExcluding the effects for foreign exchange, JOTEC revenues, excluding OEM, increased 4% and 10% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues for JOTEC, excluding OEM, increased in the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018 in EMEA and Latin America, on a constant currency basis, due to growth in distributor markets.\nRevenues for JOTEC, excluding OEM, increased in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific with the largest growth in EMEA, on a constant currency basis, due to growth in distributor markets.\nOn-X\nThe On-X product line includes the On-X prosthetic aortic and mitral heart valves and the On-X ascending aortic prosthesis ( AAP\u201d) for heart valve replacement. On-X product revenues also include revenues from the distribution of CarbonAid CO2 diffusion catheters and from the sale of Chord-X ePTFE sutures for mitral chordal replacement. On-X also generates revenue from pyrolytic carbon coating products produced for OEM.\nOn-X product revenues increased 18% and 12% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nOn-X product revenues, excluding OEM, increased 19% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 28% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 20%, and a change in average sales prices, which increased revenues by 1%, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 2%.\nOn-X product revenues, excluding OEM, increased 12% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an 11% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 14%, partially offset by a change in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 1%, and by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 1%.\nExcluding the effects for foreign exchange, On-X revenues, excluding OEM, increased 20% and 12% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nOn-X revenues, excluding OEM, increased worldwide in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 with the largest growth in EMEA in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in North America for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as a result of increases in market share. On-X OEM sales accounted for less than 1% of product revenues for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCardioGenesis Cardiac Laser Therapy\nRevenues from our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line historically consist primarily of sales of handpieces and, in certain periods, the sale of laser consoles. However, during the three months ended December 31, 2019, we did not have a supply of handpieces as our manufacturer of handpieces needs the FDA to approve its change in manufacturing location, pending resolution of several observations the FDA raised during a manufacturing site change reinspection. We do not believe these observations relate to quality or safety. We will not have any handpieces available to ship until our supplier resolves these issues with the FDA. We currently anticipate resumption of supply during the second half of 2020.\nRevenues from cardiac laser therapy decreased 38% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a 93% decrease in unit shipments of handpieces, which decreased revenues by 93%, partially offset by the effect of higher average laser console selling prices for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues from cardiac laser therapy decreased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an 18% decrease in unit shipments of handpieces, which decreased revenues by 18%, partially offset by the effect of higher average laser console selling prices and an increase in service fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nCardiac laser therapy is generally used adjunctively with cardiac bypass surgery by a limited number of physicians who perform these procedures, which usage patterns can cause period over period revenue fluctuations.\nPerClot\nRevenues from the sale of PerClot increased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 2% increase in the volume of grams sold, which increased revenues by 19%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales price, which decreased revenues by 12% and the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 3%.\nRevenues from the sale of PerClot increased 1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 3% increase in volume of grams sold, which increased revenues by 15%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales price which decreased revenues by 11%, and the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 3%.\nThe decrease in average selling prices for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was in both indirect and direct markets due to price reductions to certain customers in Europe as a result of pricing pressures from competitive products. The increase in volume for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in sales of PerClot in EMEA in the direct markets.\nWe are conducting our pivotal clinical trial to gain approval to commercialize PerClot for surgical indications in the U.S. Enrollment was completed in January 2019. We anticipate PMA submission to the FDA during the second half of 2020.\nPhotoFix\nPhotoFix revenues increased 43% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 44% increase in units sold, which increased revenues by 44%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales prices per unit, which decreased revenues by 1%.\nPhotoFix revenues increased 46% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 74% increase in units sold, which increased revenues by 46%.\nThe increase in units sold for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the number of implanting physicians when compared to the prior year period, as this product continues to penetrate domestic markets. Additional increases in unit shipments for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were from sales in EMEA, which is a new market in 2019, as well as from the introduction of smaller sized PhotoFix patches in 2018 and a larger sized PhotoFix patch in the second quarter of 2019.\nPreservation Services\nPreservation services include services revenues from the preservation of cardiac and vascular tissues. Revenues from preservation services increased 6% and 5% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. A detailed discussion of the changes in cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues is presented below.\nWe continue to evaluate modifications to our tissue processing procedures in an effort to improve tissue processing throughput, reduce costs, and maintain quality across our tissue processing business. Preservation services revenues, particularly revenues for certain high-demand cardiac tissues, can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including: quantity and type of incoming tissues, yields of tissue through the preservation process, timing of receipt of donor information, timing of the release of tissues for implant, demand for certain tissue types due to the number and type of procedures being performed, and pressures from competing products or services. See further discussion below of specific items affecting cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nCardiac Preservation Services\nOur cardiac valves are primarily used in cardiac replacement and reconstruction surgeries, including the Ross procedure, for patients with endocarditis or congenital heart defects. Our cardiac tissues are primarily distributed in domestic markets.\nRevenues from cardiac preservation services, consisting of revenues from the distribution of human heart valves and cardiac patch tissues, increased 12% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 10% increase in unit shipments of cardiac tissues, which increased revenues by 12%.\nRevenues from cardiac preservation services increased 15% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 14% increase in unit shipments of cardiac tissues, which increased revenues by 15%.\nThe increase in cardiac volume for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of cardiac valve shipments and, to a lesser extent, cardiac patch shipments.\nVascular Preservation Services\nThe majority of our vascular preservation services revenues are related to shipments of saphenous veins, which are mainly used in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations. Competition with synthetic product alternatives and the availability of tissues for processing are key factors affecting revenue volume that can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our vascular tissues are primarily distributed in domestic markets.\nRevenues from vascular preservation services decreased 1% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a 2% decrease in vascular unit shipments, which decreased revenues by 2%, partially offset by an increase in average service fees, which increased revenues by 1%.\nRevenues from vascular preservation services decreased 4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a 3% decrease in vascular tissue shipments, which decreased revenues by 3%, and a decrease in average service fees, which decreased revenues by 1%.\nThe decrease in shipments of vascular tissues for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to decreases in femoral artery and aortoiliac shipments, partially offset by increases in saphenous vein shipments. The decrease in shipments of vascular tissue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to decreases in saphenous shipments.\nThe change in average service fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by fee differences due to physical characteristics of vascular tissues, the routine negotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers, as well as competitive pricing pressures.\nCost of Products and Preservation Services\nCost of Products\nTable 12: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 55,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 53,772\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of products increased 3% and 2% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.

Gross margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat in the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in JOTEC margins driven by a decrease in revenue, offset by an increase in On-X and BioGlue margins driven by an increase in revenue.\nGross margin increased 6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in On-X, BioGlue, JOTEC, and tissue revenues. Gross margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to additional costs in 2018 for the inventory fair value adjustment recorded in purchase accounting for the JOTEC Acquisition, offset by an increase in revenues in certain international regions that have lower margins during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral, Administrative, and Marketing Expenses\nTable 15: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative, and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 37,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 35,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 143,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 140,574\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative, and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>as a percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral, administrative, and marketing expenses increased 6% and 2% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increases in general, administrative, and marketing expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were primarily due to higher expenses to support our increased revenue base and employee headcount, offset by decreased business development and integration expenses primarily related to the JOTEC Acquisition. General, administrative, and marketing expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 included approximately $500,000 and $3.1 million, respectively, in business development and integration expenses, as compared to $1.4 million and $8.4 million for the three and twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2018, respectively, primarily related to the JOTEC Acquisition and the transaction with Endospan.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 16: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 22,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 23,098\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>as a percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses decreased 22% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018, and remained flat for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Research and development spending in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily focused on clinical work for JOTEC products and to gain regulatory approval for On-X products as well as approval to commercialize PerClot for surgical indications in the U.S. Research and development spending in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily on clinical trials for PerClot in the U.S., JOTEC products, On-X products, and BioGlue in China.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $3.6 million and $14.9 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and interest expense was $3.9 million and $15.8 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.

Income before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a loss for the three months ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due the effect of foreign currency gains and losses. Income before income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in integration and business development expenses and inventory basis step-up expense related to the JOTEC Acquisition.\nOur effective income tax rate was an expense of 144% and a benefit of 5% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to a benefit of 47% and 56% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. Our income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily affected by the recording of uncertain tax positions and prior year provision to return true-ups. Our income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily affected by excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.\nOur income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily affected by excess tax benefits on stock compensation, the research and development tax credit, releases of uncertain tax position liabilities, offset by nondeductible executive compensation, intercompany interest expense disallowance, and nondeductible meals and entertainment expenses. Our income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily affected by excess tax benefits on stock compensation, the research and development tax credit and non-includable income related to the On-X settlement which increased our benefit.\nOn December 22, 2017 the United States enacted tax reform legislation known as the H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the Tax Act\u201d), resulting in significant modifications to existing law. As of December 31, 2017 we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (which was generally from 35% to 21%), which resulted in a nominal provisional amount for 2017. Upon further analysis of certain aspects of the Tax Act and refinement of our calculations during the year ended December 31, 2018, we made immaterial adjustments to our provisional estimate in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bullet 118, which are included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.\nWe elected to account for the global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) tax in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore, have not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018 our GILTI inclusion was nominal.\nThe Tax Act also created a new provision, foreign derived intangible income ( FDII\u201d), whereby certain sales made from the U.S. to overseas markets are taxed at a lower U.S. rate. We are favorably impacted by the new FDII provision and as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 our FDII deduction was $737,000 and $525,000, respectively.\nWe are also affected by the new interest deductibility rule under the Tax Act. This rule disallows interest expense to the extent it exceeds 30% of adjusted taxable income. For the year ending December 31, 2019 and 2018 our interest deduction was limited to $10.5 million and $6.6 million, respectively. The excess interest not deducted in 2019 and 2018 of $2.4 million and $17.7 million, respectively, can be carried forward indefinitely for use in future years.\nNet loss decreased and diluted income per common share was flat for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes, offset by higher income tax expense as discussed above. Net income and diluted income per common share increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by a lower income tax benefit in the twelve months ended December 31 2019 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nDiluted income per common share could be affected in future periods by changes in our common stock outstanding.\n\u200e\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues\nTable 18:

2017, respectively. A detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues and preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 is presented below.\nProducts\nRevenues from products increased 40% and 57% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. These increases were primarily due to the acquisition of JOTEC in December 2017 as well as increased revenues from the sale of On-X products. A detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues for BioGlue and BioFoam; JOTEC; On-X; CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy; PerClot; and PhotoFix is presented below.\nSales of certain products through our direct sales force and distributors across Europe and various other countries are denominated in a variety of currencies, with a concentration denominated in Euros in addition to British Pounds, Polish Zloty, Swiss Francs, Brazilian Real, and Canadian Dollars which are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. Dollar strengthened in comparison to these currencies, resulting in revenue decreases when these foreign currency denominated transactions were translated into U.S. Dollars. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. Dollar weakened in comparison to the major currencies, resulting in revenue increases when these foreign currency denominated transactions were translated into U.S. Dollars. The year-over-year average change in these currencies and the net impact on the results of operations from translations to reporting currency was not material in either period. The impact of currency translation adjustments are substantially mitigated by natural hedges which reduce our revenue and expense net exposure by currency. Additionally, our sales to many distributors around the world are denominated in U.S. Dollars and, although these sales are not directly impacted by currency exchange rates, we believe that some of our distributors may delay or reduce purchases of products in U.S. Dollars depending on the relative price of these goods in their local currencies.\nBioGlue and BioFoam\nRevenues from the sale of surgical sealants, consisting of BioGlue and BioFoam, increased 1% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 4% increase in the volume of milliliters sold, which increased revenues by 4%, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 1%, and a decrease in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 2%.\nRevenues from the sale of surgical sealants increased 1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a favorable mix in packaging sizes that vary in price per milliliter, which increased revenues by 1%, and the impact of foreign exchange rates, which increased revenues by 1%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 1%.\nThe increase in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was in the European Economic Area ( EEA\u201d), Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA\u201d), partially offset by slight decreases in other regions. The increase in revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was in the U.S., Canada, and EMEA markets, partially offset by a reduction in revenues from certain Asia Pacific and Latin American distributors due to changes in their buying patterns.\nDomestic BioGlue revenues accounted for 50% and 53% of total BioGlue revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, and 51% and 53% of total BioGlue revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. BioFoam sales accounted for less than 1% of surgical sealant sales for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. BioFoam is currently approved for sale in certain international markets.\nJOTEC\nOn December 1, 2017 CryoLife acquired JOTEC AG and its subsidiaries (the JOTEC Acquisition\u201d), a Germany-based, privately held developer of technologically differentiated endovascular stent grafts, and cardiac and vascular surgical grafts, focused on aortic repair. JOTEC products are distributed in a variety of international markets.\nJOTEC post-acquisition revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased 17% and 25%, respectively, when compared to JOTEC combined pre-acquisition and post-acquisition revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased 19% and 20%, respectively, as compared to the JOTEC combined pre-acquisition and post-acquisition revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in unit shipments.\nOn-XOn-X product revenues, excluding Original Equipment Manufacturer ( OEM\u201d), increased 13% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 15% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 14%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 1%.\nOn-X product revenues, excluding OEM, increased 21% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 26% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 30%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 9%, primarily due to geographic revenue mix.\nThe volume increase of On-X products, excluding OEM, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in volume in the U.S., EMEA, and Canada, after establishing a direct market in Canada in July 2017. On-X OEM sales accounted for less than 1% of product revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nCardioGenesis Cardiac Laser Therapy\nRevenues from our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line consist primarily of sales of handpieces and, in certain periods, the sale of laser consoles. Revenues from cardiac laser therapy decreased 2% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a 27% decrease in unit shipments of handpieces, which decreased revenues by 27%, offset by the effect of the sale of one additional laser console for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues from cardiac laser therapy decreased 9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a 12% decrease in unit shipments of handpieces, which decreased revenues by 12%, partially offset by the effect of higher average laser console selling prices for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe major contributing factors to the decrease in handpiece revenues included the de-emphasis on this product line since 2016, when the On-X product line was acquired and the corresponding realignment of our sales force. Cardiac laser therapy is generally used adjunctively with cardiac bypass surgery by a limited number of physicians who perform these procedures, although there has been a slight growth in the number of performing physicians in recent months. Revenues from laser console sales are difficult to predict and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nPerClot\nRevenues from the sale of PerClot increased 6% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 16% increase in the volume of grams sold, which increased revenues by 3%, and an increase in average selling prices, which increased revenues by 3%. The volume increase included a larger proportion of products that have lower prices and, therefore, did not have as large of an effect on total PerClot revenues.\nRevenues from the sale of PerClot increased 7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 12% increase in sales volume, which increased revenues by 8%, and the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange, which increased revenues by 3%, partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices, which decreased revenues by 4%.\nThe sales volume increase for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to higher sales of PerClot in the EMEA. The decrease in average selling prices for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to price reductions to certain customers in Europe as a result of pricing pressures from competitive products.\nPhotoFix\nPhotoFix revenues increased 37% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 189% increase in units sold, which increased revenues by 38%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales prices per unit which decreased revenues by 1%.\nPhotoFix revenues increased 22% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 109% increase in units sold, which increased revenues by 22%.\nPhotoFix is sold in a variety of unit sizes to accommodate surgical needs. We introduced smaller PhotoFix sizes in 2018 which have lower prices and, therefore, did not have as large of an effect on total revenues in both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in volume for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to an increase in the number of implanting physicians when compared to the prior year period.\nPreservation Services\nRevenues from preservation services increased 4% and 8% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. A detailed discussion of the changes in cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues is presented below.\nPreservation services revenues, particularly revenues for certain high-demand cardiac tissues, can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including: quantity and type of incoming tissues, yields of tissue through the preservation process, timing of receipt of donor information, timing of the release of tissues to an implantable status, demand for certain tissue types due to the number and type of procedures being performed, and pressures from competing products or services. See further discussion below of specific items affecting cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nCardiac Preservation Services\nRevenues from cardiac preservation services, consisting of revenues from the distribution of human heart valves and cardiac patch tissues increased 5% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 12% increase in unit shipments of cardiac tissues, which increased revenues by 6%, partially offset by a decrease in average service fees, which decreased revenues by 1%.\nRevenues from cardiac preservation services increased 10% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 16% increase in unit shipments of cardiac tissues, which increased revenues by 11%, partially offset by a decrease in average service fees, which decreased revenues by 1%.\nThe increase in volume for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was due to an increase in the volume of patch and cardiac valve shipments. The increase in volume for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of cardiac valve and, to a lesser extent, patch shipments. The decrease in average service fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to fee differences related to physical characteristics of these tissues and the routine negotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers.\nOur cardiac valves are primarily used in cardiac replacement and reconstruction surgeries, including the Ross procedure, for patients with endocarditis or congenital heart defects. Our cardiac tissues are primarily distributed in domestic markets.\nVascular Preservation Services\nRevenues from vascular preservation services increased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 10% increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues, which increased revenues by 8%, partially offset by a decrease in average service fees, which decreased revenues by 4%, primarily due to a change in product mix.\nRevenues from vascular preservation services increased 6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an 11% increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues, which increased revenues by 10%, partially offset by a decrease in average service fees, which decreased revenues by 4%, primarily due to a change in product mix.\nThe increase in shipments of vascular tissues for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was due to an increase in all vascular tissue types, but primarily due to increases in femoral artery and aortoiliac shipments. The increase in shipments of\nvascular tissues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increases in saphenous vein and femoral artery shipments.\nThe decrease in average service fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to fee differences related to physical characteristics of vascular tissues and the routine negotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers.\nThe majority of our vascular preservation services revenues were generated by shipments of saphenous veins, which are mainly used in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations. These tissues are primarily distributed in domestic markets.\nCost of Products and Preservation Services\nCost of Products\nTable 20: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of products\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 53,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,798\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of products increased 58% and 80% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Cost of products for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included costs related to BioGlue, BioFoam, JOTEC, On-X, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, PerClot, and PhotoFix.\nCost of products for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 includes $2.8 million in inventory basis step-up expense, primarily related to the JOTEC inventory fair value adjustment recorded in purchase accounting, all included prior to the three months ended December 31, 2018. Cost of products for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included $584,000 and $2.7 million, respectively, in inventory basis step-up expense related to costs for On-X products repurchased from previous international and domestic distributors in excess of the unit cost to manufacture the inventory, in addition to fair value adjustments recorded in purchase accounting for JOTEC products.\nThe increase in cost of products for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to having a full year of revenues related to JOTEC, which we acquired in December 2017, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition inventory basis step-up expense for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year period as discussed above.\nCost of Preservation Services\nTable 21: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of preservation services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 36,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 31,262\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of preservation services increased 15% for both three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Cost of preservation services includes costs for cardiac and vascular tissue preservation services.\nCost of preservation services increased in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in the unit shipment of tissues and a small increase in the unit cost of tissues. The unit cost of preservation services increased during 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily resulting from the impact of lower volume on the unit cost of tissues processed during 2017, which were an increasing portion of units shipped each quarter during 2018.\nGross Margin\nTable 22: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 45,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 36,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 172,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 128,642\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin as a percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margin increased 24% and 34% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. These increases were primarily due to the addition of margins related to the JOTEC product line and by increases in On-X product margins due to an increase in revenues.\nGross margin as a percentage of total revenues decreased in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. These decreases were primarily due to the decrease in tissue margins and a decrease in the average selling price per tissue, partially offset by JOTEC and On-X product revenue growth as a percentage of total revenues in comparison to the prior year periods.\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral, Administrative, and Marketing Expenses\nTable 23: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative, and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 35,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 30,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 140,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 101,211\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative, and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>as a percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral, administrative, and marketing expenses increased 18% and 39% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in general, administrative, and marketing expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the addition of JOTEC's general, administrative, and marketing expenses as well as higher expense to support our increased revenue base and employee headcount. General, administrative, and marketing expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 included $1.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively, in business development costs primarily related to the acquisition of JOTEC in December 2017, which include, among other costs, expenses related to the termination of international distribution agreements. General, administrative, and marketing expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included $6.6 million and $10.9 million, respectively, in business development costs primarily related to the acquisition of JOTEC in December 2017, which include, among other costs, expenses related to the termination of international distribution agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTable 24: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 23,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 19,461\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>as a percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased 7% and 19% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Research and development spending in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily on clinical trials for PerClot in the U.S., JOTEC products, On-X products, and BioGlue in China. Research and development spending in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily for clinical trials for PerClot in the U.S., our tissue processing, On-X products, and BioGlue in China, and the purchase of commercial rights to an early stage technology.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $3.9 million and $15.8 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, and interest expense was $2.4 million and $4.9 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Interest expense in the 2018 and 2017 periods included interest on debt and uncertain tax positions. Interest expense in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 includes interest on borrowings under the $225.0 million secured term loan we entered into in December 2017 to finance, in part, the acquisition of JOTEC. Interest expense in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included interest on borrowings under the $225.0 million secured term loan and interest on the previous $75.0 million term loan.\nEarnings\nTable 25: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (1,459)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (2,348)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (6,391)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,561\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (683)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,551)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (143)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (776)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (3,007)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (2,840)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,704\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted (loss) income per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (0.02)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (0.09)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (0.08)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 0.11\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,163\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss before income taxes decreased 38% for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. There was a loss before income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to income before income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in loss before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was due to an increase in gross margins, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and interest expense, as discussed above. The loss before income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was due to an increase in operating expenses and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in gross margins, as discussed above.\nOur effective income tax rate was a benefit of 47% and 56% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to an expense of 28% and a benefit of 4% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Our income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily affected by excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. Our income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was unfavorably affected by nondeductible transaction costs related to the acquisition of JOTEC, partially offset by additional excess tax benefit deductions related to stock compensation.\nOur income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was affected by excess tax benefits on stock compensation, the research and development tax credit and non-includable income related to the On-X settlement which increased our benefit. Our income tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was favorably affected by excess tax benefits on stock compensation and the Research and Development Tax Credit, partially offset by nondeductible transaction costs related to the JOTEC Acquisition and nondeductible meals and entertainment expenses.\nOn December 22, 2017 the United States enacted tax reform legislation known as the H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the Tax Act\u201d), resulting in significant modifications to existing law. For 2017, we elected to follow the guidance in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provides additional clarification regarding the application of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 in situations where we do not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted. We estimated the accounting for the effects of the Tax Act to be included in our 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and, as a result, our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect these effects of the Tax Act as provisional based on a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects and recorded a one-time estimated deemed repatriation transition tax resulting in a nominal tax impact to us, based on the interplay of the transition tax and the foreign tax credit. At December 31, 2018 after further analyses of the Tax Act, notices, and regulations issued and proposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date\nincome tax effects of the Tax Act. As further discussed below, during 2018, certain immaterial adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017 are included as a component of income tax expense.\nAs of December 31, 2017 we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (which was generally from 35% to 21%), which resulted in a nominal provisional amount for 2017. Upon further analysis of certain aspects of the Tax Act and refinement of our calculations during the year ended December 31, 2018, we made immaterial adjustments to our provisional estimate, which are included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.\nWe elected to account for the global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI\u201d) tax in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore, have not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the year ending December 31, 2018 our GILTI inclusion was nominal.\nThe Tax Act also created a new provision, foreign derived intangible income ( FDII\u201d), whereby certain sales made from the U.S. to overseas markets is taxed at a lower U.S. rate. We are favorably impacted by the new FDII provision and as of December 31, 2018 our FDII deduction was $1.1 million.\nWe are also affected by the new interest deductibility rule under the Tax Act. This rule disallows interest expense to the extent it exceeds 30% of adjusted taxable income. For the year ending December 31, 2018 our interest deduction was limited to $4.9 million. The excess interest not deducted in 2018 of $21.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely for use in future years.\nNet loss decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in loss before income taxes and by a decrease in income tax expense, as discussed above. We incurred a net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to a net gain for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes, partially offset by an increase in income tax benefit, as discussed above.\nSeasonality\nWe believe the demand for BioGlue and On-X products is seasonal, with a decline in demand generally occurring in the third quarter followed by stronger demand in the fourth quarter. We believe that this trend may be due to the summer holiday season in Europe and the U.S. We believe the seasonality for On-X products may be obscured as the On-X products have not fully penetrated many markets.\nWe believe the demand for JOTEC products is seasonal, with a decline in demand generally occurring in the third quarter due to the summer holiday season in Europe. However, the nature of any seasonal trends may be obscured due to integration activities in 2018 subsequent to the JOTEC Acquisition including the implementation of our distributor-to-direct strategy and our European sales force realignment.\nWe do not believe the demand for CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy or PerClot is seasonal.\nWe are uncertain whether the demand for PhotoFix is seasonal, as these products have not fully penetrated many markets and, therefore, the nature of any seasonal trends may not yet be obvious.\nDemand for our cardiac preservation services has traditionally been seasonal, with peak demand generally occurring in the third quarter. We believe this trend for cardiac preservation services is primarily due to the high number of surgeries scheduled during the summer months for school-aged patients. Based on experience in recent years, we believe that this trend is lessening as we are distributing a higher percentage of our tissues for use in adult populations.\nDemand for our vascular preservation services is seasonal, with lowest demand generally occurring in the fourth quarter. We believe this trend for vascular preservation services is primarily due to fewer vascular surgeries being scheduled during the winter holiday months.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet Working Capital\nAt December 31, 2019 net working capital (current assets of $187.4 million less current liabilities of $45.2 million) was $142.2 million, with a current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) of 4 to 1, compared to net working capital of $144.7 million and a current ratio of 5 to 1 at December 31, 2018.\nOverall Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary cash requirements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were for general working capital needs, funding of the Endospan agreements, interest and principal payments under our debt agreement, capital expenditures for facilities and equipment, repurchases of stock to cover tax withholdings, and business development and integration expenses. We funded our cash requirements through our existing cash reserves and proceeds from stock option exercises.\nWe believe our cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to meet our current operational liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future cash requirements are expected to include interest and principal payments under our debt agreement, expenditures for clinical trials, additional research and development expenditures, general working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and may include cash to fund business development activities including obligations as defined in the Endospan agreements. These items may have a significant effect on our future cash flows during the next twelve months. Subject to the terms of our credit facility, considering our revolving credit availability and other obligations, we may seek additional borrowing capacity or financing, pursuant to our current or any future shelf registration statement, for general corporate purposes or to fund other future cash requirements. If we undertake any further significant business development activity, we may need to finance such activities by drawing down monies under our credit agreement, discussed below, obtaining additional debt financing, or using a registration statement to sell equities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional debt or equity financing at the time needed or that such financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nSignificant Sources and Uses of Liquidity\nIn connection with the closing of the JOTEC Acquisition, we entered into a credit and guaranty agreement for a new $255.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $225.0 million secured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a $30.0 million secured revolving credit facility ( the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Agreement\u201d). We and each of our existing domestic subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions and exclusions) guarantee the obligations under the Credit Agreement (the Guarantors\u201d). The Credit Agreement is secured by a security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired real and personal property (subject to certain exceptions and exclusions) of us and the Guarantors.\nOn December 1, 2017 CryoLife borrowed the entire $225.0 million Term Loan Facility. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used along with cash on hand and shares of CryoLife common stock to (i) fund the JOTEC Acquisition, (ii) pay certain fees and expenses related to the JOTEC Acquisition and the Credit Agreement, and (iii) pay the outstanding balance of our prior credit facility.\nIn October 2018 we finalized an amendment to the Credit Agreement to reprice interest rates, resulting in a reduction in the interest rate margins over base rates on the Term Loan Facility. The loan under the Term Loan Facility bears interest, at our option, at a floating annual rate equal to either the base rate, plus a margin of 2.25%, or LIBOR, plus a margin of 3.25%. Prior to the repricing, the optional floating annual rate was equal to either the base rate, plus a margin of 3.00%, or LIBOR, plus a margin of 4.00%. The loan under the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at our option, at a floating annual rate equal to either the base rate, plus a margin of between 3.00% and 3.25%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio, or LIBOR, plus a margin of between 4.00% and 4.25%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. While a payment or bankruptcy event of default exists, we are obligated to pay a per annum default rate of interest of 2.00% in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable with respect to the overdue principal amount of any loans outstanding and overdue interest payments and other overdue fees and amounts. As of December 31, 2019 the remaining availability on our revolving credit facility was $30.0 million.\nWe intend to incur expenses for clinical research work to gain regulatory approvals for new products or indications, including JOTEC, On-X, PerClot, and BioGlue products, and to incur expenses for research and development for new products.\nWe also intend to fund two additional $5.0 million tranches upon completion of certain clinical trial milestones in connection with the Endospan Loan.\nAs of December 31, 2019 approximately 29% of our cash and cash equivalents were held in foreign jurisdictions.\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $9.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The prior year cash provided by operating activities was reduced as a result of increased integration and business development costs resulting in a higher net loss, primarily related to the JOTEC Acquisition. These expenses made up a large portion of the $8.9 million unfavorable adjustment due to the timing differences between recording accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities and the payment of cash.\nWe use the indirect method to prepare our cash flow statement, and accordingly, the operating cash flows are based on our net income (loss), which is then adjusted to remove non-cash items, items classified as investing and financing cash flows, and for changes in operating assets and liabilities from the prior year end. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 these non-cash items included $18.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $8.8 million in non-cash compensation and $5.0 million in non-cash lease expense.\nOur working capital needs, or changes in operating assets and liabilities, also affected cash from operations. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 these changes included unfavorable adjustments of $8.1 million due to an increase in inventory balances offset by lower deferred preservation costs, $6.2 million due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and $5.3 million due to the timing difference between recording receivables and the receipt of cash.\nNet Cash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $23.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $6.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to cash payments totaling $15.0 million in connection with the agreements with Endospan and $8.1 million in capital expenditures. See Part II, Item 8, Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further information on agreements with Endospan.\nNet Cash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $2.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The current year cash used was primarily due to $2.8 million in principal payments on borrowings and $2.7 million related to the redemption and repurchase of stock to cover tax withholdings, partially offset by $4.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. The prior year cash used was primarily due to $2.8 million in principal payments on borrowings and $2.1 million related to the redemption and repurchase of stock to cover tax withholdings, partially offset by $3.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nScheduled Contractual Obligations and Future Payments\nScheduled contractual obligations and the related future payments as of December 31, 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 223,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 211,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 213\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> --\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,027\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> --\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> --\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,467\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 363,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 40,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 38,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 27,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 21,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 225,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,733\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur long-term debt obligations and interest payments above result from scheduled principal payments and anticipated interest payments related to our Credit Agreement and the JOTEC governmental loans.\nOur research obligations represent commitments for ongoing studies and payments to support research and development activities.\nOur operating and finance lease obligations result from the lease of land and buildings that comprise our corporate headquarters and our various manufacturing facilities, leases related to additional manufacturing, office, and warehouse space, leases on Company vehicles, and leases on a variety of office equipment and other equipment. The operating and finance lease obligations in this schedule are based on actual payments which includes both interest and lease liability.\nThe contingent payments obligation includes two additional $5.0 million tranches under the Endospan Loan that we are required, subject to certain conditions, to advance to Endospan upon receipt of certification that certain approvals and clinical trial milestones have been achieved. The contingent payments obligation also includes payments that we may make if certain U.S. regulatory approvals and certain commercial milestones are achieved related to our transaction with Starch Medical, Inc. ( SMI\u201d) for PerClot and other licensed technologies.\nOur purchase commitments include obligations from agreements with suppliers, one of which is the minimum purchase requirements for PerClot under a distribution agreement with SMI. Pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement, we may terminate that agreement, including the minimum purchase requirements set forth in the agreement for various reasons, one of which is if we obtain FDA approval for PerClot. These minimum purchases are included in the table above through 2021, based on the assumption that we will not terminate the distribution agreement before receiving FDA approval for PerClot. However, if we do not obtain FDA approval for PerClot and/or we choose not to terminate the distribution agreement, we may have minimum purchase obligations of up to $1.75 million per year through the end of the contract term in 2025.\nThe schedule of contractual obligations above excludes (i) obligations for estimated liability claims unless they are due as a result of a settlement agreement or other contractual obligation, as no assessments have been made for specific litigation, and (ii) any estimated liability for uncertain tax positions and interest and penalties, currently estimated to be $4.0 million, as no specific assessments have been made by any taxing authorities.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $8.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were primarily related to manufacturing and tissue processing equipment, leasehold improvements needed to support our business and the routine purchases of computer software.", "summary": "In 2019, CryoLife, Inc. reported record annual revenues of $276.2 million, a 5% increase over the prior year, driven by higher revenues from On-X and preservation services.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nCryoLife, Inc. ( CryoLife,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d or us\u201d) is a leader in the manufacturing, processing, and distribution of medical devices and implantable human tissues used in cardiac and vascular surgical procedures for patients with aortic disease. We have four major product families: BioGlue\u00ae Surgical Adhesive ( BioGlue\u201d) products, JOTEC stent grafts and surgical products, On-X mechanical heart valves and surgical products, and implantable cardiac and vascular human tissues. In addition to these four major product families, we sell or distribute PhotoFixTM bovine surgical patch, PerClot\u00ae hemostatic powder, NEXUSTM endovascular stent graft system, and CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 we reported record annual revenues of $276.2 million, increasing 5% over the prior year, largely due to an increase in revenues from On-X and preservation services. For the year ended December 31, 2019 we generated $15.8 million in cash flows from operations and reported a net income of $1.7 million. See the Results of Operations\u201d section below for additional analysis of the fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. See Part I, Item 1, Business,\u201d for further discussion of our business and activities during 2019.\nAgreements with Endospan\nOn September 11, 2019 CryoLife or its wholly-owned subsidiary, JOTEC, entered into exclusive distribution and loan agreements with Endospan Ltd. ( Endospan\u201d), an Israeli corporation, as well as a securities purchase option agreement to purchase Endospan. We paid Endospan $15.0 million in September 2019 related to these agreements.\nJOTEC entered into an exclusive distribution agreement ( Endospan Distribution Agreement\u201d) with Endospan, pursuant to which JOTEC obtained exclusive distribution rights for Endospan's NEXUS stent graft system ( NEXUS\u201d) and accessories in certain countries in Europe. In addition, CryoLife entered into a securities purchase option agreement ( Endospan Option Agreement\u201d) with Endospan which provides CryoLife the option to purchase all of the outstanding securities of Endospan from Endospan's securityholders at the time of the acquisition, or the option to acquire all of Endospan's assets, in each case, for a price between $350.0 and $450.0 million before, or within, a certain period of time after U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) approval of NEXUS, with such option expiring 90 days after receiving notice that Endospan has received approval from the FDA for NEXUS. Lastly, CryoLife and Endospan entered into a loan agreement ( Endospan Loan Agreement\u201d), in which CryoLife agreed to provide Endospan a secured loan to be funded in three tranches of $5.0 million each, of which the first tranche was funded in September of 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d We believe that the consistent application of these policies enables us to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require us to make estimates and assumptions. The following are accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis, including cash equivalents, and certain restricted securities. We may make an irrevocable election to measure other financial instruments at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Fair value financial instruments are recorded in accordance with the fair value measurement framework.\nWe also measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These non-recurring valuations include evaluating assets such as certain financial assets, long-lived assets, and non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment, allocating value to assets in an acquired asset group and applying accounting for business combinations. We use the fair value measurement framework to value these assets and report these fair values in the periods in which they are recorded or written down.\nThe fair value measurement framework includes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair values in their broad levels. These levels from highest to lowest priority are as follows:\n\uf0b7Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;\n\uf0b7Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and\n\uf0b7Level 3: Unobservable inputs or valuation techniques that are used when little or no market data is available.\nThe determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement's placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation methodologies applied to our unobservable estimates and assumptions. Our assumptions could vary depending on the asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include: estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. We may also engage external advisors to assist in determining fair value, as appropriate.\nAlthough we believe that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.\nDeferred Preservation Costs\nDeferred preservation costs include costs of cardiac and vascular tissues available for shipment, tissues currently in active processing, and tissues held in quarantine pending release to implantable status. By federal law, human tissues cannot be bought or sold; therefore, the tissues we preserve are not held as inventory. The costs we incur to procure and process cardiac and vascular tissues are instead accumulated and deferred. Deferred preservation costs are stated at the lower of cost or market value on a first-in, first-out basis and are deferred until revenue is recognized. Upon shipment of tissue to an implanting facility, revenue is recognized, and the related deferred preservation costs are expensed as cost of preservation services. Cost of preservation services also includes, as applicable, lower of cost or market write-downs and impairments for tissues not deemed to be recoverable, and includes, as incurred, idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, extra freight, and re-handling costs.\nThe calculation of deferred preservation costs involves judgment and complexity and uses the same principles as inventory costing. Donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ and tissue procurement organizations ( OPOs\u201d) and tissue banks that consign the tissue to us for processing, preservation, and distribution. Deferred preservation costs consist primarily of the procurement fees charged by the OPOs and tissue banks, direct labor and materials (including salary and fringe benefits, laboratory supplies and expenses, and freight-in charges), and indirect costs (including allocations of costs from support departments and facility allocations). Fixed production overhead costs are allocated based on actual tissue processing levels, to the extent that they are within the range of the facility's normal capacity.\nThese costs are then allocated among the tissues processed during the period based on cost drivers, such as the number of donors or number of tissues processed. We apply a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable. We estimate quarantine and in process yields based on our experience and reevaluate these estimates periodically. Actual yields could differ significantly from our estimates, which could result in a change in tissues available for shipment and could increase or decrease the balance of deferred preservation costs. These changes could result in additional cost of preservation services expense or could increase per tissue preservation costs, which would impact gross margins on tissue preservation services in future periods.\nWe regularly evaluate our deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value. We also evaluate our deferred preservation costs for costs not deemed to be recoverable, including tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of their packaging. Lower of cost or market value write-downs are recorded if the tissue processing costs incurred exceed the estimated market value of the tissue services, based on recent average service fees at the time of the evaluation. Impairment write-downs are recorded based on the book value of tissues deemed to be impaired. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Write-downs of deferred preservation costs are expensed as cost of preservation services, and these write-downs are permanent impairments that create a new cost basis, which cannot be restored to its previous levels if our estimates change.\nWe recorded write-downs to our deferred preservation costs totaling $787,000, $437,000, and $922,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, due primarily to tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of the packaging.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes. We periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, as necessary, when we experience changes that could materially affect our determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. We provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, as a result of this analysis, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nAssessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets involves judgment and complexity in conjunction with prudent and feasible tax planning. Estimates and judgments used in the determination of the need for a valuation allowance and in calculating the amount of a needed valuation allowance include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\uf0b7Projected future operating results;\n\uf0b7Anticipated future state tax apportionment;\n\uf0b7Timing and amounts of anticipated future taxable income;\n\uf0b7Timing of the anticipated reversal of book/tax temporary differences;\n\uf0b7Evaluation of statutory limits regarding usage of certain tax assets; and\n\uf0b7Evaluation of the statutory periods over which certain tax assets can be utilized.\nSignificant changes in the factors above, or other factors, could affect our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Such changes could have a material, adverse impact on our profitability, financial position, and cash flows. We will continue to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, as necessary, when we experience changes that could materially affect our prior determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets.\nWe believe that the realizability of our acquired net operating loss carryforwards will be limited in future periods due to a change in control of our former subsidiaries Hemosphere, Inc. ( Hemosphere\u201d) and Cardiogenesis Corporation ( Cardiogenesis\u201d), as mandated by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe that our acquisitions of these companies each constituted a change in control as defined in Section 382 and that, prior to our acquisition, Hemosphere had experienced other equity ownership changes that should be considered such a change in control. We also acquired net operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions in our recent acquisition of JOTEC. We believe these loss carryforwards will be fully realizable. The deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets exclude amounts that we expect will not be realizable due to changes in control. A portion of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards is related to state income taxes, for which we believe it is more likely than not, that some will not be realized. Therefore, we recorded a valuation allowance against these state net operating loss carryforwards.\nValuation of Acquired Assets or Businesses\nAs part of our corporate strategy, we are seeking to identify and capitalize upon acquisition opportunities of complementary product lines and companies. We evaluate and account for acquired patents, licenses, distribution rights, and other tangible or intangible assets as the purchase of an asset or asset group, or as a business combination, as appropriate. The determination of whether the purchase of a group of assets should be accounted for as an asset group or as a business combination requires judgment based on the weight of available evidence.\nFor the purchase of an asset group, we allocate the cost of the asset group, including transaction costs, to the individual assets purchased based on their relative estimated fair values. In-process research and development acquired as part of an asset group is expensed upon acquisition. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method. Under this method, the allocation of the purchase price is based on the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs related to a business combination are expensed as incurred. In-process research and development acquired as part of a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the related research and development project gains regulatory approval or is discontinued.\nWe typically engage external advisors to assist in determining the fair value of acquired asset groups or business combinations, using valuation methodologies such as: the excess earnings, the discounted cash flow, or the relief from royalty methods. The determination of fair value in accordance with the fair value measurement framework requires significant judgments and estimates, including, but not limited to: timing of product life cycles, estimates of future revenues, estimates of profitability for new or acquired products, cost estimates for new or changed manufacturing processes, estimates of the cost or timing of obtaining regulatory approvals, estimates of the success of competitive products, and discount rates. We, in consultation with our advisor(s), make these estimates based on our prior experiences and industry knowledge. We believe that our estimates are reasonable, but actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. A significant change in our estimates used to value acquired asset groups or business combinations could result in future write-downs of tangible or intangible assets acquired by us and could, therefore, materially impact our financial position and profitability. If the value of the liabilities assumed by us, including contingent liabilities, is determined to be significantly different from the amounts previously recorded in purchase accounting, we may need to record additional expenses or write-downs in future periods, which could materially impact our financial position and profitability.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further discussion of new accounting standards that have been adopted or are being evaluated for future adoption.\nResults of Operations\n(In thousands)\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues\n\n\nRevenues increased 3% and 5% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X product revenues and cardiac preservation services revenues. The increase in revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X product revenues and cardiac preservation services revenues, as well as BioGlue and JOTEC product revenues. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues increased 4% and 7% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. A detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues and preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 is presented below.\nProducts\nRevenues from products increased 2% and 5% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X product revenues. The increase in revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X, BioGlue, and JOTEC product revenues. A detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues for BioGlue, JOTEC, On-X, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, PerClot, and PhotoFix is presented below.\nSales of certain products through our direct sales force and distributors across Europe and various other countries are denominated in a variety of currencies, with a concentration denominated in Euros in addition to British Pounds, Polish Zlotys, Swiss Francs, Brazilian Reals, and Canadian Dollars which are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 the U.S. Dollar strengthened in comparison to major currencies, resulting in revenue decreases when these foreign currency denominated transactions were translated into U.S. Dollars. Future changes in these exchange rates could have a material, adverse effect on our revenues denominated in these currencies. Additionally, our sales to many distributors around the world are denominated in U.S. Dollars, and although these sales are not directly impacted by currency exchange rates, we believe that some of our distributors may delay or reduce purchases of products in U.S. Dollars depending on the relative price of these goods in their local currencies.\nBioGlue\nThe BioGlue product line is used as an adjunct to standard methods of achieving hemostasis (such as sutures and staples) in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels (such as aorta, femoral, and carotid arteries).\nRevenues from the sale of BioGlue decreased 1% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an impact of foreign exchange rates and a change in average sales prices, each of which decreased revenues by 1%, partially offset by a change in the mix of milliliters sold, which increased revenues by 1%. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues were flat for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenues from the sale of BioGlue increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 5% increase in the volume of milliliters sold, which increased revenues by 5%, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 1%, and a decrease in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 1%. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues increased 5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nExcluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues for BioGlue increased in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 in all international markets, with the largest growth in Asia Pacific for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and EEA, the Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) and Asia Pacific for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue in Asia Pacific is due to distributor buying patterns for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue in EMEA is due to an increase in direct sales during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increases in all international markets were partially offset by decreases in domestic markets during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nWe are currently seeking regulatory approval for BioGlue in China, and if this effort is successful, management believes this will provide an additional international growth opportunity for BioGlue in future years.\nDomestic BioGlue revenues accounted for 49% and 51% of total BioGlue revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and 50% and 53% of total BioGlue revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nJOTEC\nOn December 1, 2017 CryoLife acquired JOTEC AG and its subsidiaries (the JOTEC Acquisition\u201d), a Germany-based, developer of technologically differentiated endovascular stent grafts, and cardiac and vascular surgical grafts, focused on aortic repair. The JOTEC product line is used in endovascular and open vascular surgery, as well as for the treatment of complex aortic arch and thoracic aortic diseases.\nJOTEC revenues decreased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. JOTEC revenues increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nJOTEC revenues, excluding original equipment manufacturing ( OEM\u201d), were flat for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. The factors affecting revenue during this period include a change in mix of volume sold which increased revenues by 5%, offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 4%, and a change in average sales prices which decreased revenues 1%.\nJOTEC revenues, excluding OEM, increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase in revenues was primarily due to an 8% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 11%, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 6%, and a decrease in average sales price, which decreased revenues by 2%.\nExcluding the effects for foreign exchange, JOTEC revenues, excluding OEM, increased 4% and 10% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues for JOTEC, excluding OEM, increased in the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018 in EMEA and Latin America, on a constant currency basis, due to growth in distributor markets.\nRevenues for JOTEC, excluding OEM, increased in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific with the largest growth in EMEA, on a constant currency basis, due to growth in distributor markets.\nOn-X\nThe On-X product line includes the On-X prosthetic aortic and mitral heart valves and the On-X ascending aortic prosthesis ( AAP\u201d) for heart valve replacement. On-X product revenues also include revenues from the distribution of CarbonAid CO2 diffusion catheters and from the sale of Chord-X ePTFE sutures for mitral chordal replacement. On-X also generates revenue from pyrolytic carbon coating products produced for OEM.\nOn-X product revenues increased 18% and 12% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nOn-X product revenues, excluding OEM, increased 19% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 28% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 20%, and a change in average sales prices, which increased revenues by 1%, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 2%.\nOn-X product revenues, excluding OEM, increased 12% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an 11% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 14%, partially offset by a change in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 1%, and by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 1%.\nExcluding the effects for foreign exchange, On-X revenues, excluding OEM, increased 20% and 12% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nOn-X revenues, excluding OEM, increased worldwide in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 with the largest growth in EMEA in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in North America for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as a result of increases in market share. On-X OEM sales accounted for less than 1% of product revenues for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCardioGenesis Cardiac Laser Therapy\nRevenues from our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line historically consist primarily of sales of handpieces and, in certain periods, the sale of laser consoles. However, during the three months ended December 31, 2019, we did not have a supply of handpieces as our manufacturer of handpieces needs the FDA to approve its change in manufacturing location, pending resolution of several observations the FDA raised during a manufacturing site change reinspection. We do not believe these observations relate to quality or safety. We will not have any handpieces available to ship until our supplier resolves these issues with the FDA. We currently anticipate resumption of supply during the second half of 2020.\nRevenues from cardiac laser therapy decreased 38% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a 93% decrease in unit shipments of handpieces, which decreased revenues by 93%, partially offset by the effect of higher average laser console selling prices for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues from cardiac laser therapy decreased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an 18% decrease in unit shipments of handpieces, which decreased revenues by 18%, partially offset by the effect of higher average laser console selling prices and an increase in service fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nCardiac laser therapy is generally used adjunctively with cardiac bypass surgery by a limited number of physicians who perform these procedures, which usage patterns can cause period over period revenue fluctuations.\nPerClot\nRevenues from the sale of PerClot increased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 2% increase in the volume of grams sold, which increased revenues by 19%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales price, which decreased revenues by 12% and the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 3%.\nRevenues from the sale of PerClot increased 1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 3% increase in volume of grams sold, which increased revenues by 15%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales price which decreased revenues by 11%, and the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 3%.\nThe decrease in average selling prices for the three and twelve months ended December 31,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nCryoLife, Inc. ( CryoLife,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d or us\u201d) is a leader in the manufacturing, processing, and distribution of medical devices and implantable human tissues used in cardiac and vascular surgical procedures for patients with aortic disease. We have four major product families: BioGlue\u00ae Surgical Adhesive ( BioGlue\u201d) products, JOTEC stent grafts and surgical products, On-X mechanical heart valves and surgical products, and implantable cardiac and vascular human tissues. In addition to these four major product families, we sell or distribute PhotoFixTM bovine surgical patch, PerClot\u00ae hemostatic powder, NEXUSTM endovascular stent graft system, and CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 we reported record annual revenues of $276.2 million, increasing 5% over the prior year, largely due to an increase in revenues from On-X and preservation services. For the year ended December 31, 2019 we generated $15.8 million in cash flows from operations and reported a net income of $1.7 million. See the Results of Operations\u201d section below for additional analysis of the fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. See Part I, Item 1, Business,\u201d for further discussion of our business and activities during 2019.\nAgreements with Endospan\nOn September 11, 2019 CryoLife or its wholly-owned subsidiary, JOTEC, entered into exclusive distribution and loan agreements with Endospan Ltd. ( Endospan\u201d), an Israeli corporation, as well as a securities purchase option agreement to purchase Endospan. We paid Endospan $15.0 million in September 2019 related to these agreements.\nJOTEC entered into an exclusive distribution agreement ( Endospan Distribution Agreement\u201d) with Endospan, pursuant to which JOTEC obtained exclusive distribution rights for Endospan's NEXUS stent graft system ( NEXUS\u201d) and accessories in certain countries in Europe. In addition, CryoLife entered into a securities purchase option agreement ( Endospan Option Agreement\u201d) with Endospan which provides CryoLife the option to purchase all of the outstanding securities of Endospan from Endospan's securityholders at the time of the acquisition, or the option to acquire all of Endospan's assets, in each case, for a price between $350.0 and $450.0 million before, or within, a certain period of time after U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) approval of NEXUS, with such option expiring 90 days after receiving notice that Endospan has received approval from the FDA for NEXUS. Lastly, CryoLife and Endospan entered into a loan agreement ( Endospan Loan Agreement\u201d), in which CryoLife agreed to provide Endospan a secured loan to be funded in three tranches of $5.0 million each, of which the first tranche was funded in September of 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d We believe that the consistent application of these policies enables us to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require us to make estimates and assumptions. The following are accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis, including cash equivalents, and certain restricted securities. We may make an irrevocable election to measure other financial instruments at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Fair value financial instruments are recorded in accordance with the fair value measurement framework.\nWe also measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These non-recurring valuations include evaluating assets such as certain financial assets, long-lived assets, and non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment, allocating value to assets in an acquired asset group and applying accounting for business combinations. We use the fair value measurement framework to value these assets and report these fair values in the periods in which they are recorded or written down.\nThe fair value measurement framework includes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair values in their broad levels. These levels from highest to lowest priority are as follows:\n\uf0b7Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;\n\uf0b7Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and\n\uf0b7Level 3: Unobservable inputs or valuation techniques that are used when little or no market data is available.\nThe determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement's placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation methodologies applied to our unobservable estimates and assumptions. Our assumptions could vary depending on the asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include: estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. We may also engage external advisors to assist in determining fair value, as appropriate.\nAlthough we believe that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.\nDeferred Preservation Costs\nDeferred preservation costs include costs of cardiac and vascular tissues available for shipment, tissues currently in active processing, and tissues held in quarantine pending release to implantable status. By federal law, human tissues cannot be bought or sold; therefore, the tissues we preserve are not held as inventory. The costs we incur to procure and process cardiac and vascular tissues are instead accumulated and deferred. Deferred preservation costs are stated at the lower of cost or market value on a first-in, first-out basis and are deferred until revenue is recognized. Upon shipment of tissue to an implanting facility, revenue is recognized, and the related deferred preservation costs are expensed as cost of preservation services. Cost of preservation services also includes, as applicable, lower of cost or market write-downs and impairments for tissues not deemed to be recoverable, and includes, as incurred, idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, extra freight, and re-handling costs.\nThe calculation of deferred preservation costs involves judgment and complexity and uses the same principles as inventory costing. Donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ and tissue procurement organizations ( OPOs\u201d) and tissue banks that consign the tissue to us for processing, preservation, and distribution. Deferred preservation costs consist primarily of the procurement fees charged by the OPOs and tissue banks, direct labor and materials (including salary and fringe benefits, laboratory supplies and expenses, and freight-in charges), and indirect costs (including allocations of costs from support departments and facility allocations). Fixed production overhead costs are allocated based on actual tissue processing levels, to the extent that they are within the range of the facility's normal capacity.\nThese costs are then allocated among the tissues processed during the period based on cost drivers, such as the number of donors or number of tissues processed. We apply a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable. We estimate quarantine and in process yields based on our experience and reevaluate these estimates periodically. Actual yields could differ significantly from our estimates, which could result in a change in tissues available for shipment and could increase or decrease the balance of deferred preservation costs. These changes could result in additional cost of preservation services expense or could increase per tissue preservation costs, which would impact gross margins on tissue preservation services in future periods.\nWe regularly evaluate our deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value. We also evaluate our deferred preservation costs for costs not deemed to be recoverable, including tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of their packaging. Lower of cost or market value write-downs are recorded if the tissue processing costs incurred exceed the estimated market value of the tissue services, based on recent average service fees at the time of the evaluation. Impairment write-downs are recorded based on the book value of tissues deemed to be impaired. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Write-downs of deferred preservation costs are expensed as cost of preservation services, and these write-downs are permanent impairments that create a new cost basis, which cannot be restored to its previous levels if our estimates change.\nWe recorded write-downs to our deferred preservation costs totaling $787,000, $437,000, and $922,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, due primarily to tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of the packaging.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes. We periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, as necessary, when we experience changes that could materially affect our determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. We provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, as a result of this analysis, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nAssessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets involves judgment and complexity in conjunction with prudent and feasible tax planning. Estimates and judgments used in the determination of the need for a valuation allowance and in calculating the amount of a needed valuation allowance include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\uf0b7Projected future operating results;\n\uf0b7Anticipated future state tax apportionment;\n\uf0b7Timing and amounts of anticipated future taxable income;\n\uf0b7Timing of the anticipated reversal of book/tax temporary differences;\n\uf0b7Evaluation of statutory limits regarding usage of certain tax assets; and\n\uf0b7Evaluation of the statutory periods over which certain tax assets can be utilized.\nSignificant changes in the factors above, or other factors, could affect our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Such changes could have a material, adverse impact on our profitability, financial position, and cash flows. We will continue to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, as necessary, when we experience changes that could materially affect our prior determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets.\nWe believe that the realizability of our acquired net operating loss carryforwards will be limited in future periods due to a change in control of our former subsidiaries Hemosphere, Inc. ( Hemosphere\u201d) and Cardiogenesis Corporation ( Cardiogenesis\u201d), as mandated by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe that our acquisitions of these companies each constituted a change in control as defined in Section 382 and that, prior to our acquisition, Hemosphere had experienced other equity ownership changes that should be considered such a change in control. We also acquired net operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions in our recent acquisition of JOTEC. We believe these loss carryforwards will be fully realizable. The deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets exclude amounts that we expect will not be realizable due to changes in control. A portion of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards is related to state income taxes, for which we believe it is more likely than not, that some will not be realized. Therefore, we recorded a valuation allowance against these state net operating loss carryforwards.\nValuation of Acquired Assets or Businesses\nAs part of our corporate strategy, we are seeking to identify and capitalize upon acquisition opportunities of complementary product lines and companies. We evaluate and account for acquired patents, licenses, distribution rights, and other tangible or intangible assets as the purchase of an asset or asset group, or as a business combination, as appropriate. The determination of whether the purchase of a group of assets should be accounted for as an asset group or as a business combination requires judgment based on the weight of available evidence.\nFor the purchase of an asset group, we allocate the cost of the asset group, including transaction costs, to the individual assets purchased based on their relative estimated fair values. In-process research and development acquired as part of an asset group is expensed upon acquisition. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method. Under this method, the allocation of the purchase price is based on the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs related to a business combination are expensed as incurred. In-process research and development acquired as part of a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the related research and development project gains regulatory approval or is discontinued.\nWe typically engage external advisors to assist in determining the fair value of acquired asset groups or business combinations, using valuation methodologies such as: the excess earnings, the discounted cash flow, or the relief from royalty methods. The determination of fair value in accordance with the fair value measurement framework requires significant judgments and estimates, including, but not limited to: timing of product life cycles, estimates of future revenues, estimates of profitability for new or acquired products, cost estimates for new or changed manufacturing processes, estimates of the cost or timing of obtaining regulatory approvals, estimates of the success of competitive products, and discount rates. We, in consultation with our advisor(s), make these estimates based on our prior experiences and industry knowledge. We believe that our estimates are reasonable, but actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. A significant change in our estimates used to value acquired asset groups or business combinations could result in future write-downs of tangible or intangible assets acquired by us and could, therefore, materially impact our financial position and profitability. If the value of the liabilities assumed by us, including contingent liabilities, is determined to be significantly different from the amounts previously recorded in purchase accounting, we may need to record additional expenses or write-downs in future periods, which could materially impact our financial position and profitability.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Part II, Item 8, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further discussion of new accounting standards that have been adopted or are being evaluated for future adoption.\nResults of Operations\n(In

respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X product revenues and cardiac preservation services revenues. The increase in revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X product revenues and cardiac preservation services revenues, as well as BioGlue and JOTEC product revenues. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues increased 4% and 7% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. A detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues and preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 is presented below.\nProducts\nRevenues from products increased 2% and 5% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X product revenues. The increase in revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increases in On-X, BioGlue, and JOTEC product revenues. A detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues for BioGlue, JOTEC, On-X, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, PerClot, and PhotoFix is presented below.\nSales of certain products through our direct sales force and distributors across Europe and various other countries are denominated in a variety of currencies, with a concentration denominated in Euros in addition to British Pounds, Polish Zlotys, Swiss Francs, Brazilian Reals, and Canadian Dollars which are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 the U.S. Dollar strengthened in comparison to major currencies, resulting in revenue decreases when these foreign currency denominated transactions were translated into U.S. Dollars. Future changes in these exchange rates could have a material, adverse effect on our revenues denominated in these currencies. Additionally, our sales to many distributors around the world are denominated in U.S. Dollars, and although these sales are not directly impacted by currency exchange rates, we believe that some of our distributors may delay or reduce purchases of products in U.S. Dollars depending on the relative price of these goods in their local currencies.\nBioGlue\nThe BioGlue product line is used as an adjunct to standard methods of achieving hemostasis (such as sutures and staples) in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels (such as aorta, femoral, and carotid arteries).\nRevenues from the sale of BioGlue decreased 1% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an impact of foreign exchange rates and a change in average sales prices, each of which decreased revenues by 1%, partially offset by a change in the mix of milliliters sold, which increased revenues by 1%. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues were flat for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenues from the sale of BioGlue increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 5% increase in the volume of milliliters sold, which increased revenues by 5%, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 1%, and a decrease in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 1%. Excluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues increased 5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nExcluding the effects for foreign exchange, revenues for BioGlue increased in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 in all international markets, with the largest growth in Asia Pacific for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and EEA, the Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) and Asia Pacific for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue in Asia Pacific is due to distributor buying patterns for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue in EMEA is due to an increase in direct sales during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increases in all international markets were partially offset by decreases in domestic markets during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nWe are currently seeking regulatory approval for BioGlue in China, and if this effort is successful, management believes this will provide an additional international growth opportunity for BioGlue in future years.\nDomestic BioGlue revenues accounted for 49% and 51% of total BioGlue revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and 50% and 53% of total BioGlue revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nJOTEC\nOn December 1, 2017 CryoLife acquired JOTEC AG and its subsidiaries (the JOTEC Acquisition\u201d), a Germany-based, developer of technologically differentiated endovascular stent grafts, and cardiac and vascular surgical grafts, focused on aortic repair. The JOTEC product line is used in endovascular and open vascular surgery, as well as for the treatment of complex aortic arch and thoracic aortic diseases.\nJOTEC revenues decreased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. JOTEC revenues increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nJOTEC revenues, excluding original equipment manufacturing ( OEM\u201d), were flat for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. The factors affecting revenue during this period include a change in mix of volume sold which increased revenues by 5%, offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 4%, and a change in average sales prices which decreased revenues 1%.\nJOTEC revenues, excluding OEM, increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase in revenues was primarily due to an 8% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 11%, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 6%, and a decrease in average sales price, which decreased revenues by 2%.\nExcluding the effects for foreign exchange, JOTEC revenues, excluding OEM, increased 4% and 10% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues for JOTEC, excluding OEM, increased in the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018 in EMEA and Latin America, on a constant currency basis, due to growth in distributor markets.\nRevenues for JOTEC, excluding OEM, increased in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific with the largest growth in EMEA, on a constant currency basis, due to growth in distributor markets.\nOn-X\nThe On-X product line includes the On-X prosthetic aortic and mitral heart valves and the On-X ascending aortic prosthesis ( AAP\u201d) for heart valve replacement. On-X product revenues also include revenues from the distribution of CarbonAid CO2 diffusion catheters and from the sale of Chord-X ePTFE sutures for mitral chordal replacement. On-X also generates revenue from pyrolytic carbon coating products produced for OEM.\nOn-X product revenues increased 18% and 12% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nOn-X product revenues, excluding OEM, increased 19% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 28% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 20%, and a change in average sales prices, which increased revenues by 1%, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 2%.\nOn-X product revenues, excluding OEM, increased 12% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an 11% increase in volume of units sold, which increased revenues by 14%, partially offset by a change in average sales prices, which decreased revenues by 1%, and by the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 1%.\nExcluding the effects for foreign exchange, On-X revenues, excluding OEM, increased 20% and 12% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nOn-X revenues, excluding OEM, increased worldwide in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 with the largest growth in EMEA in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in North America for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as a result of increases in market share. On-X OEM sales accounted for less than 1% of product revenues for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nCardioGenesis Cardiac Laser Therapy\nRevenues from our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line historically consist primarily of sales of handpieces and, in certain periods, the sale of laser consoles. However, during the three months ended December 31, 2019, we did not have a supply of handpieces as our manufacturer of handpieces needs the FDA to approve its change in manufacturing location, pending resolution of several observations the FDA raised during a manufacturing site change reinspection. We do not believe these observations relate to quality or safety. We will not have any handpieces available to ship until our supplier resolves these issues with the FDA. We currently anticipate resumption of supply during the second half of 2020.\nRevenues from cardiac laser therapy decreased 38% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a 93% decrease in unit shipments of handpieces, which decreased revenues by 93%, partially offset by the effect of higher average laser console selling prices for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues from cardiac laser therapy decreased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an 18% decrease in unit shipments of handpieces, which decreased revenues by 18%, partially offset by the effect of higher average laser console selling prices and an increase in service fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.\nCardiac laser therapy is generally used adjunctively with cardiac bypass surgery by a limited number of physicians who perform these procedures, which usage patterns can cause period over period revenue fluctuations.\nPerClot\nRevenues from the sale of PerClot increased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 2% increase in the volume of grams sold, which increased revenues by 19%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales price, which decreased revenues by 12% and the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 3%.\nRevenues from the sale of PerClot increased 1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a 3% increase in volume of grams sold, which increased revenues by 15%, partially offset by a decrease in average sales price which decreased revenues by 11%, and the effect of foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenues by 3%.\nThe decrease in average selling prices for the three and twelve months ended December 31,"}
