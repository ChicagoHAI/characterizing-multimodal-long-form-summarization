MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nThe information and financial data discussed below is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Gilla Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015. The financial statements were prepared and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and are expressed in U.S. Dollars. The information and financial data discussed below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes of Gilla Inc. contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, which fully represent the financial condition and operations of Gilla Inc., but which are not necessarily indicative of future performance.\nOverview\nGilla Inc. (the Company\u201d, the Registrant\u201d or Gilla\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on March 28, 1995 under the name of Truco, Inc. The Company later changed its name to Web Tech, Inc., and then to Cynergy, Inc., Mercantile Factoring Credit Online Corp., Incitations, Inc., Osprey Gold Corp. and to its present name. The Company adopted the present name, Gilla Inc., on February 27, 2007. Gilla's address is 475 Fentress Blvd., Unit L, Daytona Beach, Florida 32114.\nThe current business of the Company consists of the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of generic and premium branded E-liquid, which is the liquid used in vaporizers, E-cigarettes, and other vaping hardware and accessories. E-liquid is heated by the atomizer to deliver the sensation of smoking. Gilla's product portfolio includes Craft Vapes, Craft Clouds, Vape Warriors, Miss Pennysworth's Elixirs, The Mad Alchemist, Replicant and Coil Glaze E-liquid brands.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Preparation\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) for annual financial statements and with Form 10-K and article 8 of the Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries; Gilla Operations, LLC ( Gilla Operations\u201d); E Vapor Labs Inc.; E-Liq World, LLC; Charlie's Club, Inc. ( Charlie's Club\u201d); Gilla Enterprises Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Gilla Europe Kft.; Gilla Operations Worldwide Limited ( Gilla Worldwide\u201d); Gilla Franchises, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary Legion of Vape, LLC.; and Snoke Distribution Canada Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary Snoke Distribution USA, LLC. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company's Canadian subsidiaries maintain their books and records in Canadian dollars (CAD) which is also their functional currency. The Company's Irish subsidiary maintains its books in Euros (EUR) which is also its functional currency. The Company's Hungarian subsidiary maintains its books in the Hungarian Forint (HUF) which is also its functional currency. The Company and its U.S. subsidiaries maintain their books and records in United States dollars (USD) which is both the Company's functional currency and reporting currency. The accounts of the Company are translated into United States dollars in accordance with provisions of ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate on the date of the transaction. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the reporting periods. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in net income (loss) for the period. In translating the financial statements of the Company's Canadian and Irish subsidiaries from their functional currencies into the Company's reporting currency of United States dollars, balance sheet accounts are translated using the closing exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation, if any, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. The Company has not, to the date of these consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding for the period, computed under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings per Share ( ASC 260-10\u201d). Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents (if dilutive) related to convertible preferred stock, stock options and warrants for each period. There were no common stock equivalent shares outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 that have been included in the diluted loss per share calculation as the effects would have been anti-dilutive.\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet when the Company has become party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\nThe Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued interest, due to related parties, accrued liabilities, customer deposit, promissory notes, convertible debentures, loans from shareholders and credit facility. The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying value, due to their short term nature. Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company's financial instruments recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by FASB ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure ( ASC 820\u201d), with the related amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to value these assets and liabilities at fair value for each level, are as follows:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf Level 1\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf Level 2\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf Level 3\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Inputs that are not based on observable market data.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified as Level 1 hierarchy because measurements are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price to the customer is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For the Company's membership program the Company records revenue on collection of the monthly fee and after delivery of the products has occurred. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Customers take delivery at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board shipping point. For sales designated free on board destination, customers take delivery when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site. Provisions for sales incentives, product returns, and discounts to customers are recorded as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company does not currently record a provision for product returns as to date sales in the membership program have been minimal and any returns related to sales through the Company's wholesale distribution channels become the responsibility of the manufacturer.\nInventory\nInventory consists of finished E-liquid bottles, E-liquid components, bottles, E-cigarettes and accessories as well as related packaging. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost as determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, or market value. The Company measures inventory write-downs as the difference between the cost of inventory and market value. At the point of any inventory write-downs to market, the Company establishes a new, lower cost basis for that inventory, and any subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of the former cost basis or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nThe Company reviews product sales and returns from the previous 12 months and future demand forecasts and writes off any excess or obsolete inventory. The Company also assesses inventory for obsolescence by testing the products to ensure they have been properly stored and maintained so that they will perform according to specifications. In addition, the Company assesses the market for competing products to determine that the existing inventory will be competitive in the marketplace.\nIf there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in future demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, the Company could be required to write down inventory and accordingly gross margin could be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes ( ASC 740-10\u201d) which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statement or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Temporary differences between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes include, but are not limited to, accounting for intangibles, debt discounts associated with convertible debt, equity based compensation and depreciation and amortization. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired by the Company in business combinations. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. In addition, ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units; assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions or the occurrence of one or more confirming events in future periods could cause the actual results or outcomes to materially differ from such estimates and could also affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment at future reporting dates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material. The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets within the next financial year, include reserves and write downs of receivables and inventory, useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, impairment of goodwill, accruals, valuing stock based compensation, valuing equity securities, valuation of convertible debenture conversion options and deferred taxes and related valuation allowances. Certain of our estimates could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to our industry and general economic conditions. It is possible that these external factors could have an effect on our estimates that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates. The Company re-evaluates all of its accounting estimates at least quarterly based on the conditions and records adjustments when necessary.\nConvertible Debt Instruments\nThe Company accounts for convertible debt instruments when the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. The Company amortizes the respective debt discount over the term of the notes, using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The Company records, when necessary, induced conversion expense, at the time of conversion for the difference between the reduced conversion price per share and the original conversion price per share.\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for common stock purchase warrants at fair value in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging. The Black-Scholes option pricing valuation method is used to determine fair value of these warrants consistent with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Use of this method requires that the Company make assumptions regarding stock value, dividend yields, expected term of the warrants and risk free interest rates.\nIntangible Assets\nOn acquisition, intangible assets, other than goodwill, are initially recorded at their fair value. Following initial recognition, intangible assets with a finite life are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful life. Useful lives are assessed at year end.\nThe following useful lives are used in the calculation of amortization:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> Brands\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer relationships\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and other than the below, does not expect the future adoption of any such pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), requiring an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, deferring the effective date for ASU 2014-09 by one year, and thus, the new standard will be effective for us beginning on February 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted on or after February 1, 2017. This standard may be adopted using either the full or modified retrospective methods. Management of the Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. Management of the Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the consolidated balance sheet statement of financial position. The amendments in the update require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. Management of the Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize all leases with terms in excess of one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date. The new standard also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein and must be adopted using a modified retrospective method for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. Management of the Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company generated $1,163,096 in sales from E-liquid, vaporizers, E-cigarettes and accessories ( E-liquid\u201d) as compared to $581,822 in sales for the year ended December 31, 2014.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred an administrative expense of $1,472,196, consulting fees to related parties of $628,956, depreciation expense of $2,783, amortization expense of $6,666, loss on sale of fixed asset of $654, bad debt expense of $27,731 and impairment of inventory expense of $101,458. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2,240,444. Administrative costs were primarily comprised of rent, legal and audit fees, marketing fees, travel expenses, consulting fees and employee wages. The increase in administrative expenses of $510,918 is attributable to increased operations as a result of the acquired businesses during the period and the organic growth within the business. The decrease in consulting fees due to related parties of $23,776 is attributable to the effects of foreign exchange translation. Bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to an allowance for uncollected receivables and the bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to the write off of uncollectible receivables. The impairment of website and inventory recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was due to website and inventory obsolescence.\nLoss from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred a loss from operations of $2,574,944 as compared to $2,123,129 for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the reasons discussed above.\nOther Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred a foreign exchange gain of $155,519, amortization of debt discount of $239,330, loss on settlement of debt of $4,431 and interest expense of $385,151.

The change in comprehensive loss compared to net loss was due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the Company's translation of financial statements from Canadian dollars, Euros and Hungarian Forints to U.S. dollars.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nAs at December 31, 2015, the Company had total assets of $2,231,055 (compared to total assets of $1,086,485 at December 31, 2014) consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $81,696, trade receivables of $45,534, inventory of $154,700, other current assets of $322,326, property and equipment of $150,349, website development of $9,083, intangibles of $215,283 and goodwill of $1,252,084. The increase in assets at December 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, is primarily the result of the acquisitions of E Vapor Labs (see Acquisition of E Vapor Labs\u201d), VaporLiq and the assets of the Craft Vapes E-liquid brand (see Acquisition of CV Brands\u201d) and The Mad Alchemist E-liquid brand (see Acquisition of TMA Brands\u201d).\nAs at December 31, 2015, the Company had total liabilities of $5,000,695 (compared to total liabilities of $2,639,901 at December 31, 2014) consisting of accounts payable of $687,767, accrued liabilities of $251,517, accrued interest due to related parties of $131,755, customer deposits of $ 372,500, loans from shareholders of $27,528, due to related parties of $996,939, Promissory Notes of $495,193, amounts owing on acquisitions of $150,549, Convertible Debentures of $80,658, advances on Credit Facility of $212,415, long term loans from shareholders of $461,250, long term due to related parties of $662,140, long term amounts owing on acquisitions of $196,127, long term Promissory Notes of $267,857 and long term Convertible Debentures of $6,500.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had negative working capital of $2,802,565 and an accumulated deficit of $8,750,688.\nAs at December 31, 2014, the Company had total assets of $1,086,485 consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $496,724, trade receivables of $37,125, inventory of $78,901, other current assets of $378,548, property and equipment of $1,864 and website development of $93,323.\nAs at December 31, 2014, the Company had total liabilities of $2,639,901 consisting of accounts payable of $309,139, accrued liabilities of $69,017, accrued interest due to related parties of $39,279, loans from shareholders of $34,739, due to related parties of $1,144,789, advances on Credit Facility of $387,110, long term loans from shareholders of $531,000, long term due to related parties of $100,000 and long term Convertible Debentures of $24,828.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company had negative working capital of $992,775 and an accumulated deficit of $5,702,351.\nNet cash used in operating activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company used cash of $890,890 (December 31, 2014: $1,315,018) in operating activities to fund administrative, marketing and sales. The decrease is attributable to the results of operations and changes in the operating assets and liabilities as discussed above.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $250,452 attributable to the addition of capital assets and the acquisitions of completed during the year ended December 31, 2015 (see Acquisition of E Vapor Labs\u201d, Acquisition of CV Brands\u201d and Acquisition of TMA Brands\u201d). For year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activates was $54,919 attributable to the disposal of capital assets and website development.\nNet cash flow from financing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $632,286 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,426,399 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of Convertible Debenture Units (see Secured Note No.3\u201d and Convertible Debenture Units\u201d), issuance of common stock, net proceeds advanced from related parties and the net repayments made on the Credit Facility (see Credit Facility\u201d).\nAcquisition of E Vapor Labs\nOn July 1, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of E Vapor Labs, a Florida based E-liquid manufacturer. The Company purchased E Vapor Labs in order to procure an E-liquid manufacturing platform allowing the Company to secure large private label contracts as well as manufacture its own brands going forward. The following summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the consideration transferred at the acquisition date:\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> Assets acquired:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,942\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Receivables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 48,356\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other current assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,195\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 122,309\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 118,867\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated purchase price\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 847,265\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets acquired\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,180,934\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities assumed:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 206,252\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities assumed\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,252\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consideration:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 225,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Promissory Notes A, unsecured and non-interest bearing, due November 1, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 196,026\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Promissory Notes B, unsecured and non-interest bearing, due April 1, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 275,555\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Promissory Notes C, unsecured and non-interest bearing, due January 1, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 253,101\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 949,682\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid to the vendors, $225,000 in cash on closing and $900,000 in unsecured promissory notes issued on the closing (collectively, the Promissory Notes\u201d). The Promissory Notes were issued in three equal tranches of $300,000 due four (4), nine (9) and eighteen (18) months respectfully from the closing (individually, Promissory Notes A\u201d, Promissory Notes B\u201d, and Promissory Notes C\u201d respectively). The Promissory Notes are all unsecured, non-interest bearing, and on the maturity date, at the option of the vendors, up to one third (1/3) of each tranche of the Promissory Notes can be repaid in Common Shares of the Company, calculated using the 5 day weighted average closing market price of the Company prior to the maturity of the Promissory Notes. The Promissory Notes, are all and each subject to adjustments as outlined in the share purchase agreement (the SPA\u201d), dated June 25, 2015.\nAs at December 31, 2015, the Company has adjusted the Promissory Notes A for the known difference in the working capital balance at closing of the acquisition from the amount specified in the SPA. Further, a 12% discount rate has been used to calculate the present value of the Promissory Notes based on the Company's estimate of cost of financing for comparable notes with similar term and risk profiles. Over the term of the respective Promissory Notes, interest will be accrued at 12% per annum to accrete the Promissory Notes to their respective principal amounts.\nThe Promissory Notes A were due on November 1, 2015. The Company provided notice to the Promissory Note holders on October 30, 2015 indicating its intention to repay such Promissory Notes, however, such inability to accurately determine the required adjustments pursuant to the SPA has forced the Company to defer repayment of such Promissory Notes until such time where the principal amount of the Promissory Notes can be accurately determined.\nThe Company is not able to complete the purchase price allocation as the Company has disputed the consideration amount and is currently undergoing negotiations (note 20).\nThe results of operations of E Vapor Labs have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date.

The Credit Facility shall bear interest at a rate of 15% per annum on all drawn advances and a standby fee of 3.5% per annum on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility shall mature on August 1, 2015 whereby the outstanding advances together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable. On August 1, 2014, and in connection to the Credit Facility, the Company issued 250,000 warrants to purchase Common Shares of the Company exercisable over two years with an exercise price of $0.30 per Common Share. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are both participants of the consortium of participants of the Credit Facility, each having committed to provide ten percent of the principal amount of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the Company's inventory and accounts due relating to any inventory as granted in an intercreditor and subordination agreement by and among the Company, the Secured Note holder and the Lender to establish the relative rights and priorities of the secured parties against the Company and a security agreement by and between the Company and the Lender.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company was advanced $387,110 (CAD $449,083) from the Credit Facility for the purchase of inventory including $77,453 (CAD $89,852) of advances from the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as their participation in the Credit Facility.\nOn February 11, 2015, the Company fully repaid the amounts advanced from the Credit Facility.\nOn April 24, 2015, the Company was advanced $89,590 (CAD $124,000) from the Credit Facility including $17,918 (CAD $24,800) of advances from the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as their participation in the Credit Facility.\nOn September 1, 2015, the Company was advanced $122,825 (CAD $170,000) from the Credit Facility including $24,565 (CAD $34,000) of advances from the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as their participation in the Credit Facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company paid $30,670 (December 31, 2014: $25,363) of interest and standby fees as a result of the Credit Facility.\nSatisfaction of Our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in these consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2015, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $8,750,688 and a working capital deficiency of $2,802,565 as well as negative cash flows from operating activities of $890,890 for the year ended December 31, 2015. These conditions represent material uncertainty that cast significant doubts about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations or on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. Management believes that the Company will not be able to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months without additional financing or increased revenues.\nTo meet these objectives, the Company continues to seek other sources of financing in order to support existing operations and expand the range and scope of its business. However, there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on acceptable terms and in a timely manner, if at all. Failure to obtain the necessary working capital would have a material adverse effect on the business prospects and, depending upon the shortfall, the Company may have to curtail or cease its operations.\nThese consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company have to curtail operations or be unable to continue in existence.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no off balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nThe Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, it may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. The Company's inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not expect the future adoption of any such pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.\nMaterial Commitments\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> a)\n</td> <td> Operating Lease\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe future minimum payment under an operating lease for the use of a vehicle amounts to approximately CAD $799 per month.

On February 23, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis of failure to allege sufficient jurisdictional facts and failure to satisfy constitutional due process requirements to exercise jurisdiction.\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> d)\n</td> <td> Employment Agreements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to certain employment agreements with the Company's management, the Company has agreed to pay termination amounts in the first year of up to twelve months of annual entitlements under such agreements, less any amounts paid during the first year, ending on December 1, 2016.\nFinancial Transactions\nOn November 15, 2012, the Company entered into a convertible revolving credit note (the Credit Note\u201d) with a related party, whereby the Company agreed to pay the party the aggregate unpaid principal amount of $225,000 on or before February 15, 2014, bearing interest at a rate of 6% per annum.

The financial statements were prepared and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and are expressed in U.S. Dollars. The information and financial data discussed below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes of Gilla Inc. contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, which fully represent the financial condition and operations of Gilla Inc., but which are not necessarily indicative of future performance.\nOverview\nGilla Inc. (the Company\u201d, the Registrant\u201d or Gilla\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on March 28, 1995 under the name of Truco, Inc. The Company later changed its name to Web Tech, Inc., and then to Cynergy, Inc., Mercantile Factoring Credit Online Corp., Incitations, Inc., Osprey Gold Corp. and to its present name. The Company adopted the present name, Gilla Inc., on February 27, 2007. Gilla's address is 475 Fentress Blvd., Unit L, Daytona Beach, Florida 32114.\nThe current business of the Company consists of the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of generic and premium branded E-liquid, which is the liquid used in vaporizers, E-cigarettes, and other vaping hardware and accessories. E-liquid is heated by the atomizer to deliver the sensation of smoking. Gilla's product portfolio includes Craft Vapes, Craft Clouds, Vape Warriors, Miss Pennysworth's Elixirs, The Mad Alchemist, Replicant and Coil Glaze E-liquid brands.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Preparation\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) for annual financial statements and with Form 10-K and article 8 of the Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries; Gilla Operations, LLC ( Gilla Operations\u201d); E Vapor Labs Inc.; E-Liq World, LLC; Charlie's Club, Inc. ( Charlie's Club\u201d); Gilla Enterprises Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Gilla Europe Kft.; Gilla Operations Worldwide Limited ( Gilla Worldwide\u201d); Gilla Franchises, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary Legion of Vape, LLC.; and Snoke Distribution Canada Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary Snoke Distribution USA, LLC. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company's Canadian subsidiaries maintain their books and records in Canadian dollars (CAD) which is also their functional currency. The Company's Irish subsidiary maintains its books in Euros (EUR) which is also its functional currency. The Company's Hungarian subsidiary maintains its books in the Hungarian Forint (HUF) which is also its functional currency. The Company and its U.S. subsidiaries maintain their books and records in United States dollars (USD) which is both the Company's functional currency and reporting currency. The accounts of the Company are translated into United States dollars in accordance with provisions of ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate on the date of the transaction. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the reporting periods. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in net income (loss) for the period. In translating the financial statements of the Company's Canadian and Irish subsidiaries from their functional currencies into the Company's reporting currency of United States dollars, balance sheet accounts are translated using the closing exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation, if any, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. The Company has not, to the date of these consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding for the period, computed under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings per Share ( ASC 260-10\u201d). Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents (if dilutive) related to convertible preferred stock, stock options and warrants for each period. There were no common stock equivalent shares outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 that have been included in the diluted loss per share calculation as the effects would have been anti-dilutive.\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet when the Company has become party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\nThe Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued interest, due to related parties, accrued liabilities, customer deposit, promissory notes, convertible debentures, loans from shareholders and credit facility. The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying value, due to their short term nature. Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company's financial instruments recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by FASB ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure ( ASC 820\u201d), with the related amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to value these assets and liabilities at fair value for each level, are as follows:\n\nCash and cash equivalents is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified as Level 1 hierarchy because measurements are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price to the customer is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For the Company's membership program the Company records revenue on collection of the monthly fee and after delivery of the products has occurred. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Customers take delivery at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board shipping point. For sales designated free on board destination, customers take delivery when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site. Provisions for sales incentives, product returns, and discounts to customers are recorded as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company does not currently record a provision for product returns as to date sales in the membership program have been minimal and any returns related to sales through the Company's wholesale distribution channels become the responsibility of the manufacturer.\nInventory\nInventory consists of finished E-liquid bottles, E-liquid components, bottles, E-cigarettes and accessories as well as related packaging. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost as determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, or market value. The Company measures inventory write-downs as the difference between the cost of inventory and market value. At the point of any inventory write-downs to market, the Company establishes a new, lower cost basis for that inventory, and any subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of the former cost basis or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nThe Company reviews product sales and returns from the previous 12 months and future demand forecasts and writes off any excess or obsolete inventory. The Company also assesses inventory for obsolescence by testing the products to ensure they have been properly stored and maintained so that they will perform according to specifications. In addition, the Company assesses the market for competing products to determine that the existing inventory will be competitive in the marketplace.\nIf there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in future demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, the Company could be required to write down inventory and accordingly gross margin could be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes ( ASC 740-10\u201d) which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statement or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Temporary differences between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes include, but are not limited to, accounting for intangibles, debt discounts associated with convertible debt, equity based compensation and depreciation and amortization. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired by the Company in business combinations. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. In addition, ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units; assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions or the occurrence of one or more confirming events in future periods could cause the actual results or outcomes to materially differ from such estimates and could also affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment at future reporting dates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material. The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets within the next financial year, include reserves and write downs of receivables and inventory, useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, impairment of goodwill, accruals, valuing stock based compensation, valuing equity securities, valuation of convertible debenture conversion options and deferred taxes and related valuation allowances. Certain of our estimates could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to our industry and general economic conditions. It is possible that these external factors could have an effect on our estimates that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates. The Company re-evaluates all of its accounting estimates at least quarterly based on the conditions and records adjustments when necessary.\nConvertible Debt Instruments\nThe Company accounts for convertible debt instruments when the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. The Company amortizes the respective debt discount over the term of the notes, using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The Company records, when necessary, induced conversion expense, at the time of conversion for the difference between the reduced conversion price per share and the original conversion price per share.\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for common stock purchase warrants at fair value in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging. The Black-Scholes option pricing valuation method is used to determine fair value of these warrants consistent with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Use of this method requires that the Company make assumptions regarding stock value, dividend yields, expected term of the warrants and risk free interest rates.\nIntangible Assets\nOn acquisition, intangible assets, other than goodwill, are initially recorded at their fair value. Following initial recognition, intangible assets with a finite life are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful life. Useful lives are assessed at year end.\nThe following useful lives are used in the calculation of amortization:\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and other than the below, does not expect the future adoption of any such pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), requiring an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, deferring the effective date for ASU 2014-09 by one year, and thus, the new standard will be effective for us beginning on February 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted on or after February 1, 2017. This standard may be adopted using either the full or modified retrospective methods. Management of the Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. Management of the Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the consolidated balance sheet statement of financial position. The amendments in the update require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. Management of the Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize all leases with terms in excess of one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date. The new standard also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein and must be adopted using a modified retrospective method for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. Management of the Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company generated $1,163,096 in sales from E-liquid, vaporizers, E-cigarettes and accessories ( E-liquid\u201d) as compared to $581,822 in sales for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2,829,153. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred an administrative expense of $1,472,196, consulting fees to related parties of $628,956, depreciation expense of $2,783, amortization expense of $6,666, loss on sale of fixed asset of $654, bad debt expense of $27,731 and impairment of inventory expense of $101,458. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2,240,444. Administrative costs were primarily comprised of rent, legal and audit fees, marketing fees, travel expenses, consulting fees and employee wages. The increase in administrative expenses of $510,918 is attributable to increased operations as a result of the acquired businesses during the period and the organic growth within the business. The decrease in consulting fees due to related parties of $23,776 is attributable to the effects of foreign exchange translation. Bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to an allowance for uncollected receivables and the bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to the write off of uncollectible receivables. The impairment of website and inventory recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was due to website and inventory obsolescence.\nLoss from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred a loss from operations of $2,574,944 as compared to $2,123,129 for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the reasons discussed above.\nOther Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred a foreign exchange gain of $155,519, amortization of debt discount of $239,330, loss on settlement of debt of $4,431 and interest expense of $385,151.

The change in comprehensive loss compared to net loss was due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the Company's translation of financial statements from Canadian dollars, Euros and Hungarian Forints to U.S. dollars.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nAs at December 31, 2015, the Company had total assets of $2,231,055 (compared to total assets of $1,086,485 at December 31, 2014) consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $81,696, trade receivables of $45,534, inventory of $154,700, other current assets of $322,326, property and equipment of $150,349, website development of $9,083, intangibles of $215,283 and goodwill of $1,252,084. The increase in assets at December 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, is primarily the result of the acquisitions of E Vapor Labs (see Acquisition of E Vapor Labs\u201d), VaporLiq and the assets of the Craft Vapes E-liquid brand (see Acquisition of CV Brands\u201d) and The Mad Alchemist E-liquid brand (see Acquisition of TMA Brands\u201d).\nAs at December 31, 2015, the Company had total liabilities of $5,000,695 (compared to total liabilities of $2,639,901 at December 31, 2014) consisting of accounts payable of $687,767, accrued liabilities of $251,517, accrued interest due to related parties of $131,755, customer deposits of $ 372,500, loans from shareholders of $27,528, due to related parties of $996,939, Promissory Notes of $495,193, amounts owing on acquisitions of $150,549, Convertible Debentures of $80,658, advances on Credit Facility of $212,415, long term loans from shareholders of $461,250, long term due to related parties of $662,140, long term amounts owing on acquisitions of $196,127, long term Promissory Notes of $267,857 and long term Convertible Debentures of $6,500.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had negative working capital of $2,802,565 and an accumulated deficit of $8,750,688.\nAs at December 31, 2014, the Company had total assets of $1,086,485 consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $496,724, trade receivables of $37,125, inventory of $78,901, other current assets of $378,548, property and equipment of $1,864 and website development of $93,323.\nAs at December 31, 2014, the Company had total liabilities of $2,639,901 consisting of accounts payable of $309,139, accrued liabilities of $69,017, accrued interest due to related parties of $39,279, loans from shareholders of $34,739, due to related parties of $1,144,789, advances on Credit Facility of $387,110, long term loans from shareholders of $531,000, long term due to related parties of $100,000 and long term Convertible Debentures of $24,828.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company had negative working capital of $992,775 and an accumulated deficit of $5,702,351.\nNet cash used in operating activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company used cash of $890,890 (December 31, 2014: $1,315,018) in operating activities to fund administrative, marketing and sales. The decrease is attributable to the results of operations and changes in the operating assets and liabilities as discussed above.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $250,452 attributable to the addition of capital assets and the acquisitions of completed during the year ended December 31, 2015 (see Acquisition of E Vapor Labs\u201d, Acquisition of CV Brands\u201d and Acquisition of TMA Brands\u201d). For year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activates was $54,919 attributable to the disposal of capital assets and website development.\nNet cash flow from financing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $632,286 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,426,399 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of Convertible Debenture Units (see Secured Note No.3\u201d and Convertible Debenture Units\u201d), issuance of common stock, net proceeds advanced from related parties and the net repayments made on the Credit Facility (see Credit Facility\u201d).\nAcquisition of E Vapor Labs\nOn July 1, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of E Vapor Labs, a Florida based E-liquid manufacturer. The Company purchased E Vapor Labs in order to procure an E-liquid manufacturing platform allowing the Company to secure large private label contracts as well as manufacture its own brands going forward. The following summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the consideration transferred at the acquisition date:\n\nIn consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid to the vendors, $225,000 in cash on closing and $900,000 in unsecured promissory notes issued on the closing (collectively, the Promissory Notes\u201d). The Promissory Notes were issued in three equal tranches of $300,000 due four (4), nine (9) and eighteen (18) months respectfully from the closing (individually, Promissory Notes A\u201d, Promissory Notes B\u201d, and Promissory Notes C\u201d respectively). The Promissory Notes are all unsecured, non-interest bearing, and on the maturity date, at the option of the vendors, up to one third (1/3) of each tranche of the Promissory Notes can be repaid in Common Shares of the Company, calculated using the 5 day weighted average closing market price of the Company prior to the maturity of the Promissory Notes. The Promissory Notes, are all and each subject to adjustments as outlined in the share purchase agreement (the SPA\u201d), dated June 25, 2015.\nAs at December 31, 2015, the Company has adjusted the Promissory Notes A for the known difference in the working capital balance at closing of the acquisition from the amount specified in the SPA. Further, a 12% discount rate has been used to calculate the present value of the Promissory Notes based on the Company's estimate of cost of financing for comparable notes with similar term and risk profiles. Over the term of the respective Promissory Notes, interest will be accrued at 12% per annum to accrete the Promissory Notes to their respective principal amounts.\nThe Promissory Notes A were due on November 1, 2015. The Company provided notice to the Promissory Note holders on October 30, 2015 indicating its intention to repay such Promissory Notes, however, such inability to accurately determine the required adjustments pursuant to the SPA has forced the Company to defer repayment of such Promissory Notes until such time where the principal amount of the Promissory Notes can be accurately determined.\nThe Company is not able to complete the purchase price allocation as the Company has disputed the consideration amount and", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nThe information and financial data discussed below is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Gilla Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015. The financial statements were prepared and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and are expressed in U.S. Dollars. The information and financial data discussed below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes of Gilla Inc. contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, which fully represent the financial condition and operations of Gilla Inc., but which are not necessarily indicative of future performance.\nOverview\nGilla Inc. (the Company\u201d, the Registrant\u201d or Gilla\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on March 28, 1995 under the name of Truco, Inc. The Company later changed its name to Web Tech, Inc., and then to Cynergy, Inc., Mercantile Factoring Credit Online Corp., Incitations, Inc., Osprey Gold Corp. and to its present name. The Company adopted the present name, Gilla Inc., on February 27, 2007. Gilla's address is 475 Fentress Blvd., Unit L, Daytona Beach, Florida 32114.\nThe current business of the Company consists of the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of generic and premium branded E-liquid, which is the liquid used in vaporizers, E-cigarettes, and other vaping hardware and accessories. E-liquid is heated by the atomizer to deliver the sensation of smoking. Gilla's product portfolio includes Craft Vapes, Craft Clouds, Vape Warriors, Miss Pennysworth's Elixirs, The Mad Alchemist, Replicant and Coil Glaze E-liquid brands.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Preparation\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) for annual financial statements and with Form 10-K and article 8 of the Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries; Gilla Operations, LLC ( Gilla Operations\u201d); E Vapor Labs Inc.; E-Liq World, LLC; Charlie's Club, Inc. ( Charlie's Club\u201d); Gilla Enterprises Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Gilla Europe Kft.; Gilla Operations Worldwide Limited ( Gilla Worldwide\u201d); Gilla Franchises, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary Legion of Vape, LLC.; and Snoke Distribution Canada Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary Snoke Distribution USA, LLC. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company's Canadian subsidiaries maintain their books and records in Canadian dollars (CAD) which is also their functional currency. The Company's Irish subsidiary maintains its books in Euros (EUR) which is also its functional currency. The Company's Hungarian subsidiary maintains its books in the Hungarian Forint (HUF) which is also its functional currency. The Company and its U.S. subsidiaries maintain their books and records in United States dollars (USD) which is both the Company's functional currency and reporting currency. The accounts of the Company are translated into United States dollars in accordance with provisions of ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate on the date of the transaction. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the reporting periods. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in net income (loss) for the period. In translating the financial statements of the Company's Canadian and Irish subsidiaries from their functional currencies into the Company's reporting currency of United States dollars, balance sheet accounts are translated using the closing exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate prevailing during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation, if any, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. The Company has not, to the date of these consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding for the period, computed under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings per Share ( ASC 260-10\u201d). Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents (if dilutive) related to convertible preferred stock, stock options and warrants for each period. There were no common stock equivalent shares outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 that have been included in the diluted loss per share calculation as the effects would have been anti-dilutive.\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet when the Company has become party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\nThe Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued interest, due to related parties, accrued liabilities, customer deposit, promissory notes, convertible debentures, loans from shareholders and credit facility. The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying value, due to their short term nature. Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company's financial instruments recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by FASB ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure ( ASC 820\u201d), with the related amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to value these assets and liabilities at fair value for each level, are as follows:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> \u25cf Level 1\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf Level 2\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf Level 3\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Inputs that are not based on observable market data.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified as Level 1 hierarchy because measurements are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price to the customer is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For the Company's membership program the Company records revenue on collection of the monthly fee and after delivery of the products has occurred. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Customers take delivery at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board shipping point. For sales designated free on board destination, customers take delivery when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site. Provisions for sales incentives, product returns, and discounts to customers are recorded as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company does not currently record a provision for product returns as to date sales in the membership program have been minimal and any returns related to sales through the Company's wholesale distribution channels become the responsibility of the manufacturer.\nInventory\nInventory consists of finished E-liquid bottles, E-liquid components, bottles, E-cigarettes and accessories as well as related packaging. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost as determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, or market value. The Company measures inventory write-downs as the difference between the cost of inventory and market value. At the point of any inventory write-downs to market, the Company establishes a new, lower cost basis for that inventory, and any subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of the former cost basis or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nThe Company reviews product sales and returns from the previous 12 months and future demand forecasts and writes off any excess or obsolete inventory. The Company also assesses inventory for obsolescence by testing the products to ensure they have been properly stored and maintained so that they will perform according to specifications. In addition, the Company assesses the market for competing products to determine that the existing inventory will be competitive in the marketplace.\nIf there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in future demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, the Company could be required to write down inventory and accordingly gross margin could be adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes ( ASC 740-10\u201d) which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statement or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Temporary differences between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes include, but are not limited to, accounting for intangibles, debt discounts associated with convertible debt, equity based compensation and depreciation and amortization. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired by the Company in business combinations. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350\u201d). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. In addition, ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests when circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill may be in doubt. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units; assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions or the occurrence of one or more confirming events in future periods could cause the actual results or outcomes to materially differ from such estimates and could also affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment at future reporting dates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material. The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets within the next financial year, include reserves and write downs of receivables and inventory, useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, impairment of goodwill, accruals, valuing stock based compensation, valuing equity securities, valuation of convertible debenture conversion options and deferred taxes and related valuation allowances. Certain of our estimates could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to our industry and general economic conditions. It is possible that these external factors could have an effect on our estimates that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates. The Company re-evaluates all of its accounting estimates at least quarterly based on the conditions and records adjustments when necessary.\nConvertible Debt Instruments\nThe Company accounts for convertible debt instruments when the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. The Company amortizes the respective debt discount over the term of the notes, using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The Company records, when necessary, induced conversion expense, at the time of conversion for the difference between the reduced conversion price per share and the original conversion price per share.\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for common stock purchase warrants at fair value in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging. The Black-Scholes option pricing valuation method is used to determine fair value of these warrants consistent with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Use of this method requires that the Company make assumptions regarding stock value, dividend yields, expected term of the warrants and risk free interest rates.\nIntangible Assets\nOn acquisition, intangible assets, other than goodwill, are initially recorded at their fair value. Following initial recognition, intangible assets with a finite life are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful life. Useful lives are assessed at year end.\nThe following useful lives are used in the calculation of amortization:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> Brands\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer relationships\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and other than the below, does not expect the future adoption of any such pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), requiring an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, deferring the effective date for ASU 2014-09 by one year, and thus, the new standard will be effective for us beginning on February 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted on or after February 1, 2017. This standard may be adopted using either the full or modified retrospective methods. Management of the Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. Management of the Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17\u201d). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the consolidated balance sheet statement of financial position. The amendments in the update require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. Management of the Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize all leases with terms in excess of one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date. The new standard also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein and must be adopted using a modified retrospective method for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. Management of the Company is currently evaluating adoption methods and the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company generated $1,163,096 in sales from E-liquid, vaporizers, E-cigarettes and accessories ( E-liquid\u201d) as compared to $581,822 in sales for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Administrative costs were primarily comprised of rent, legal and audit fees, marketing fees, travel expenses, consulting fees and employee wages. The increase in administrative expenses of $510,918 is attributable to increased operations as a result of the acquired businesses during the period and the organic growth within the business. The decrease in consulting fees due to related parties of $23,776 is attributable to the effects of foreign exchange translation. Bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to an allowance for uncollected receivables and the bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to the write off of uncollectible receivables. The impairment of website and inventory recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was due to website and inventory obsolescence.\nLoss from Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred a loss from operations of $2,574,944 as compared to $2,123,129 for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the reasons discussed above.\nOther Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred a foreign exchange gain of $155,519, amortization of debt discount of $239,330, loss on settlement of debt of $4,431 and interest expense of $385,151.

For year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activates was $54,919 attributable to the disposal of capital assets and website development.\nNet cash flow from financing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $632,286 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,426,399 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of Convertible Debenture Units (see Secured Note No.3\u201d and Convertible Debenture Units\u201d), issuance of common stock, net proceeds advanced from related parties and the net repayments made on the Credit Facility (see Credit Facility\u201d).\nAcquisition of E Vapor Labs\nOn July 1, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of E Vapor Labs, a Florida based E-liquid manufacturer. The Company purchased E Vapor Labs in order to procure an E-liquid manufacturing platform allowing the Company to secure large private label contracts as well as manufacture its own brands going forward. The following summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the consideration transferred at the acquisition date:\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> Assets acquired:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,942\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Receivables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 48,356\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other current assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,195\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 122,309\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 118,867\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated purchase price\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 847,265\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets acquired\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,180,934\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities assumed:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 206,252\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liabilities assumed\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,252\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consideration:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 225,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Promissory Notes A, unsecured and non-interest bearing, due November 1, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 196,026\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Promissory Notes B, unsecured and non-interest bearing, due April 1, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 275,555\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Promissory Notes C, unsecured and non-interest bearing, due January 1, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 253,101\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 949,682\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid to the vendors, $225,000 in cash on closing and $900,000 in unsecured promissory notes issued on the closing (collectively, the Promissory Notes\u201d). The Promissory Notes were issued in three equal tranches of $300,000 due four (4), nine (9) and eighteen (18) months respectfully from the closing (individually, Promissory Notes A\u201d, Promissory Notes B\u201d, and Promissory Notes C\u201d respectively). The Promissory Notes are all unsecured, non-interest bearing, and on the maturity date, at the option of the vendors, up to one third (1/3) of each tranche of the Promissory Notes can be repaid in Common Shares of the Company, calculated using the 5 day weighted average closing market price of the Company prior to the maturity of the Promissory Notes. The Promissory Notes, are all and each subject to adjustments as outlined in the share purchase agreement (the SPA\u201d), dated June 25, 2015.\nAs at December 31, 2015, the Company has adjusted the Promissory Notes A for the known difference in the working capital balance at closing of the acquisition from the amount specified in the SPA. Further, a 12% discount rate has been used to calculate the present value of the Promissory Notes based on the Company's estimate of cost of financing for comparable notes with similar term and risk profiles. Over the term of the respective Promissory Notes, interest will be accrued at 12% per annum to accrete the Promissory Notes to their respective principal amounts.\nThe Promissory Notes A were due on November 1, 2015. The Company provided notice to the Promissory Note holders on October 30, 2015 indicating its intention to repay such Promissory Notes, however, such inability to accurately determine the required adjustments pursuant to the SPA has forced the Company to defer repayment of such Promissory Notes until such time where the principal amount of the Promissory Notes can be accurately determined.\nThe Company is not able to complete the purchase price allocation as the Company has disputed the consideration amount and"}
