Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years or year-end refers to the fiscal year ending September 30 and dollars are in thousands, except per share data)\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company\nGriffon Corporation (the Company\u201d or Griffon\u201d) is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.\nOn September 5, 2017, Griffon announced it will explore strategic alternatives for Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (\"PPC\") and on November 16, 2017, announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell PPC to Berry Global Group, Inc. (NYSE:BERY) (\"Berry\") for $475 million in cash. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the first quarter of calendar 2018. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the PPC business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude PPC unless otherwise noted. PPC, incorporated in 1934, is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products and sells to some of the world's largest consumer products companies. Griffon acquired PPC in 1986 as part of the acquisition of Clopay Corporation. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations to the Notes of the Financial Statements.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon acquired ClosetMaid LLC (\"ClosetMaid\"). ClosetMaid, founded in 1965, is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of closet organization, home storage, and garage storage products, and sells to some of the largest home center retail chains, mass merchandisers, and direct-to-builder professional installers in North America. Due to the acquisition of ClosetMaid occurring subsequent to Griffon's fiscal year end, ClosetMaid's results of operations, assets and liabilities were not included in Griffon's 2017 financial results or 2017 year-end balance sheet.\nGriffon currently conducts its continuing operations through two reportable segments:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Home & Building Products (\"HBP\") consists of three companies, The AMES Companies, Inc.

Gross profit for 2017 was $408,116 compared to $400,693 in 2016, with gross margin as a percent of sales ( gross margin\u201d) of 26.8% and 27.1%, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations of $339,089 increased 7% from the prior year amount of $318,353. SG&A for 2017, as a percent of revenue, was 22.2%, compared to 21.6% in the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of $9,617 of acquisition related expenditures.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2017 of $51,513 increased 3% compared to the prior year of $49,943 primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the May 2016 add-on offering of $125,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 and higher outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOther income (expense) from continuing operations of $(880) in 2017 and $(250) in 2016 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $16,698 for the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $32,213 for the prior year. In 2017, the Company recognized a tax benefit of (6.5)% compared to a tax provision of 38.6% in 2016. The 2017 tax rates included $8,274 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense, a federal domestic production activities deduction and a federal R&D credit. The 2016 tax rates included an $857 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense and the release of unrecognized tax benefits.\nExcluding the discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, and certain other items from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were 39.7% and 41.3%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $17,783, or $0.41 per share, for 2017 compared to $19,781, or $0.45 per share in the prior year.\nThe current year results included the following from continuing operations:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $8,274, or $0.19 per share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe prior year results included discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $857 or $0.02 per share from continuing operations.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2017 Income from continuing operations would have been $18,954, or $0.44 per share compared to $18,924, or $0.43 per share, in 2016.\nNet income was $14,912, or $0.35 per share, for 2017 compared to $30,010, or $0.68 per share in the prior year.\nThe current year results included the following:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Environmental and warranty reserves of $5,700 ($3,703, net of tax, or $0.09 per share); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, of $9,385, or $0.22 per share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The prior year results included the following:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Restructuring charges of $5,900 ($4,247 net of tax, or $0.10 per share); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Discrete and certain other tax provisions $2,658 or $0.06 per share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2017 Net income would have been $37,445, or $0.87 per share compared to $36,915, or $0.84 per share, in 2016.\nThe tax provisions on all pre-tax income inclusive of discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 resulted in tax rates of 61.7% and 43.6%, respectively. These 2017 and 2016 tax rates included $9,385 and $2,658, respectively, of discrete and certain other tax provisions. Excluding these tax items and certain other items, as listed above, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were 37.0% and 37.5%, respectively.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2016 of $1,477,035 was in line with the $1,483,291 in the prior year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency at HBP, revenue trailed the prior year by 1%. Gross profit from continuing operations for 2016 was $400,693 compared to $392,347 in 2015, with gross margin of 27.1% and 26.5%, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations for 2016 of $318,353 decreased 2% from the prior year amount of $325,435. SG&A for 2016, as a percent of revenue, was 21.6%, compared to 21.9% in the prior year due to plant and distribution center consolidations and management cost control measures in the HBP segment.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2016 totaled $49,943, a 5% increase from the prior year primarily due to the May 2016 add-on offering of $125,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022.\nOther income (expense) of $(250) in 2016 and $(331) in 2015 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $32,213 for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to $19,066 for the prior year. In 2016, the Company recognized a tax provision of 38.6% compared to 35.5% in 2015. The 2016 tax rates included $857 of net discrete tax benefits related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense. The 2015 tax rate included a net discrete benefit of $219.\nExcluding the above discrete tax and certain other items, from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 41.3% and 36.7%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $19,781, or $0.45 per share, for 2016 compared to $12,294, or $0.26 per share in the prior year. The 2016 results included a discrete tax benefit, net, of $(857) or $(0.02) per share. The 2015 results included discrete tax benefits, net, of $(219) or $0.00 per share. Excluding discrete items from both reporting periods, 2016 Income from continuing operations would have been $18,924, or $0.43 per share compared to $12,075, or $0.26 per share, in 2015.\nNet income was $30,010, or $0.68 per share, for 2016 compared to $34,289, or $0.73 per share in the prior year.\nThe 2016 results included the following:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Restructuring charges of $5,900 ($4,247, net of tax, or $0.10 per share); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Discrete tax provisions, net, of $2,658 or $0.06 per share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2015 results included discrete tax benefits, net, of $(62) or $0.00 per share.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2016 Net income would have been $36,915, or $0.84 per share compared to $34,227, or $0.73 per share, in 2015.\nGriffon evaluates performance based on Earnings per share and Net income excluding restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment, acquisition related expenses, discrete and certain other tax items, as well other items that may affect comparability, as applicable.

AMES revenue increased 6%, primarily due to increased UK market expansion and contributions from the La Hacienda and Hills acquisitions, and increased Canadian snow and lawn tools sales. CBP revenue increased 8% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased volume, pricing and favorable mix.\nSegment operating profit in 2017 was $89,495 compared to $79,682 in 2016, an increase of $9,813, or 12% driven by the increased revenue noted above and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased steel and resin costs. Segment depreciation and amortization increased $1,280 from the prior year period.\nOn November 6, 2017, AMES acquired Harper Brush Works ( Harper\u201d), a division of Horizon Global, for approximately $5,000. Harper is a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use. The acquisition will broaden AMES' long-handle tool offering in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning tools and accessories. The acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $10,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon completed the acquisition of ClosetMaid, a market leader of home storage and organization products, for approximately $200,000, or $175,000 inclusive of the net present value of tax benefits. ClosetMaid adds to Griffon's Home and Building Products segment, complementing and diversifying Griffon's portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. ClosetMaid is expected to generate approximately $300,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn September 29, 2017, AMES Australia completed the acquisition of Tuscan Landscape Group Pty, Ltd. (\"Tuscan Path\"), a leading Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden decor products, for approximately $18,000 (AUD 22,250). The acquisition of Tuscan Path broadens AMES' outdoor living and lawn and garden business, and will strengthen AMES' industry leading position in Australia. Tuscan Path is expected to generate approximately AUD 25,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn July 31, 2017, The AMES Companies, Inc. acquired La Hacienda Limited, a leading United Kingdom outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden decor products, for approximately $11,400 (GBP 9,175). The acquisition of La Hacienda broadens AMES' global outdoor living and lawn and garden business and supports AMES' UK expansion strategy. La Hacienda is expected to generate approximately GBP 14,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn December 30, 2016, AMES Australia acquired Home Living (\"Hills\") for approximately $6,051 (AUD 8,400). Hills, founded in 1946, is a market leader in the supply of clothesline, laundry and garden products. The Hills acquisition adds to AMES' existing broad category of products and enhances its lawn and garden product offerings in Australia. Hills is expected to generate approximately AUD 10,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after acquisition.\nOn February 14, 2016, AMES Australia acquired substantially all of the Intellectual Property (IP) assets of Australia-based Nylex Plastics Pty Ltd. for $1,744 (AUD 2,452). Through this acquisition, AMES and Griffon secured the ownership of the trademark Nylex\u201d for certain categories of AMES products, principally in the country of Australia. Previously, the Nylex name was licensed. The acquisition of the Nylex IP was contemplated as a post-closing activity of the Cyclone acquisition and supports AMES' Australian watering products strategy.\nOn October 15, 2015, CBP announced plans to expand its manufacturing facility in Troy, Ohio. In the second quarter of 2017, CBP completed this 250,000 square foot expansion of its state-of-the-art facility, which reflects increased customer demand for its core products, and CBP's success in bringing new technologies to market. The Troy facility now has 1.23 million square feet of combined manufacturing and office space. CBP's Russia, Ohio facility provides additional production capacity, particularly for specialized and custom products.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nSegment revenue decreased $10,858, or 1%, compared to the prior year period. Excluding a $14,900 or 1% unfavorable foreign currency impact, revenue remained consistent with the prior year period. AMES revenue decreased 4%, mainly driven by a combination of a warm winter and a cold and wet spring in both the U.S. and Canada, resulting in reduced snow and spring tool category sales, respectively, partially offset by improved sales of North American pots and planters and increased product offerings in Australia; foreign currency was 2% unfavorable. CBP revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to improved volume and favorable mix; the impact of foreign currency was not material.\nSegment operating profit in 2016 was $79,682 compared to $58,883 in 2015, an increase of $20,799, or 35% driven by operational efficiency improvements, cost control measures at AMES and increased volume and favorable mix at CBP and decreased material costs, which more than offset the impact of reduced revenue at AMES; foreign currency was 4% unfavorable. Segment depreciation and amortization remained consistent with the prior year.\nTelephonics\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>10,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract settlement charges\n</td> <td>5,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue in 2017 decreased $23,965, or 6%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreased multi-mode radar revenue and certain ground surveillance systems, partially offset by favorable performance on electronic countermeasure systems revenue.\nSegment operating profit decreased $12,858 from the prior year period. During 2017, Telephonics recorded a $5,137 charge, consisting of a settlement in the amount of $4,250 plus 2% interest and associated legal costs, related to certain amounts the civil division of the US Department of Justice indicated it believed it was owed from Telephonics with respect to certain US government contracts, performed during the 2005 to 2013 time period, in which Telephonics acted as a subcontractor. Excluding these charges, segment operating profit in the current year would have been $35,080, a $7,721 decrease from the prior year period primarily due to the decreased revenue noted above, unfavorable program mix and the impact of revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain radar and communication programs.\nDuring 2017, Telephonics was awarded several new contracts and incremental funding on existing contracts approximating $342,400. Contract backlog was $350,900 at September 30, 2017 with 70% expected to be fulfilled in the next 12 months; backlog was $420,000 at September 30, 2016. Backlog is defined as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer or Congress, in the case of the U.S. government agencies. The decrease in backlog was primarily due to the timing of various U.S. and international contract awards associated with radar and surveillance opportunities.\nIn December 2015, Telephonics invested an additional $2,726 increasing its equity stake from 26% to 49% in Mahindra Telephonics Integrated Systems (MTIS), a joint venture with Mahindra Defence Systems, a Mahindra Group Company. MTIS is an aerospace and defense manufacturing and development facility in Prithla, India.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenue in 2016 increased $4,602, or 1%, compared to the prior year period, due to mobile ground surveillance systems and dismounted Electronic Countermeasure systems, partially offset by airborne maritime and Identification Friend or Foe (\"IFF\") radar systems.\nSegment operating profit remained consistent with the prior year period.\nUnallocated Amounts\nFor 2017, unallocated amounts, consisting primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $42,398 compared to $40,393 in 2016, with the increase primarily due to compensation and incentive costs.\nFor 2016, unallocated amounts, which consist primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $40,393 compared to $35,308 in 2015 primarily due to expenses related to the pursuit of acquisition opportunities, expenses relating to an intellectual property legal claim (in which Griffon is the plaintiff) and increased insurance costs.\nSegment Depreciation and Amortization\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $47,398 in 2017 compared to the prior year of $45,851, increased $1,547 primarily due to depreciation for new assets placed in service.\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $45,851 in 2016 remained consistent with the prior year of $45,365.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nDuring 2017, total other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $20,760 consisted of a $10,667 income on Foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, Canadian, British Pound, Brazilian and Australian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar, a $9,203 gain from Pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to higher assumed discount rates compared to the prior year and a $890 gain on cash flow hedges.\nDuring 2016, total other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $9,947 consisted of a $17,284 income on Foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, Canadian, Brazilian and Australian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar, a $5,651 loss from Pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to lower assumed discount rates compared to the prior year and a $1,686 loss on cash flow hedges.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nPlastic Products Company\nOn September 5, 2017, Griffon announced it will explore strategic alternatives for Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (\"PPC\") and on November 16, 2017, announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell PPC to Berry for $475 million in cash. As a result, the following PPC results have been classified PPC as a discontinued operation.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>460,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>532,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>27,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue in 2017 decreased $19,212 or 4%, in comparison to 2016, primarily due to unfavorable volume of 4% driven by Europe, partially offset by increased volume in North America and Brazil, as well as unfavorable mix of 2%. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable resin impact of $3,600, or 1% and favorable foreign currency of 1%. PPC adjusts selling prices based on underlying resin costs on a delayed basis.\nSegment operating profit increased $4,978 or 25%, compared to the prior year. During 2016, PPC recorded restructuring charges of $5,900 primarily related to headcount reductions at PPC's Dombuhl, Germany facility, other location headcount reductions and the shut down of PPC's Turkey facility. Excluding these charges, prior year Segment operating profit was $26,213 compared to the current year of $25,291, a decrease of $922 or 4%, due to reduced volume, unfavorable mix, a $2,100 change in the impact of resin pricing pass through and increased depreciation of $3,603 resulting from investment in worldwide breathable film and printing capacity, partially offset by improved operations.\nDuring April 2016, PPC announced a breathable film investment, which will expand breathable film capacity in North America, Europe and Brazil, increase PPC's extrusion and print capacity, and enhance PPC's innovation and technology capabilities. Griffon expect the project to be completed in fiscal 2018. These investments will allow PPC to maintain and extend its technological advantage and allow it to differentiate itself from competitors, while meeting increasing customer demand for lighter, softer, more cost effective and more environmentally friendly products.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenue in 2016 decreased $52,615 or 10%, in comparison to 2015, primarily due to decreased volume of 4% driven by reduced North America and Europe baby care orders, unfavorable mix of 3% and a $17,100 or 3% unfavorable foreign currency impact. Resin pricing had no material impact on revenue in the current year. PPC adjusts selling prices based on underlying resin costs on a delayed basis.\nSegment operating profit decreased $12,824 or 39%, compared to the prior year. During 2016, PPC recorded restructuring charges of $5,900 primarily related to headcount reductions at PPC's Dombuhl, Germany facility, other location headcount reductions and the shut down of PPC's Turkey facility. Excluding these charges, current year Segment operating profit was $26,213, a decrease of $6,924 or 21%, compared to the prior year, due to reduced volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by decreased SG&A spending. Resin pricing and foreign currency did not have a material impact on Segment operating profit for the year. Segment depreciation and amortization remained consistent with the prior year.\nRestructuring\nIn 2016, PPC incurred pre-tax restructuring and related exit costs approximating $5,900 primarily related to headcount reductions at PPC's Dombuhl, Germany facility, other location headcount reductions and the shut down of PPC's Turkey facility. These actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 86 positions. The Dombuhl charges were related to an optimization plan that will drive innovation and enhance PPC's industry leading position in printed breathable back sheet. In conjunction with this effort, PPC's customer base will be streamlined, and PPC will dispose of old assets and reduce overhead costs, allowing for gains in efficiencies. Management estimates that these actions will result in annual cash savings of $4,000 based on current operating levels.\nInstallation Services and Other Discontinued Activities\nIn 2008, as a result of the downturn in the residential housing market, Griffon exited substantially all operating activities of its Installation Services segment which sold, installed and serviced garage doors and openers, fireplaces, floor coverings, cabinetry and a range of related building products, primarily for the new residential housing market. Griffon sold eleven units, closed one unit and merged two units into CBP. Operating results of substantially this entire segment have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented; Installation Services is excluded from segment reporting.\nGriffon substantially concluded remaining disposal activities in 2009. There was no reported revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Future net cash outflows to satisfy liabilities related to disposal activities accrued as of September 30, 2017 are estimated to be $5,679.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2017, Griffon recorded $5,700 of reserves in discontinued operations related to historical environmental remediation efforts and to increase the reserve for homeowner association claims (HOA) related to installation services.\nAt September 30, 2017, Griffon's assets and liabilities for discontinued operations primarily related to income taxes and product liability, warranty and environmental reserves.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nManagement assesses Griffon's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital under satisfactory terms. Griffon believes it has sufficient liquidity available to invest in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on both a short-term and long-term basis.\nThe following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows from Continuing Operations\n</td> <td>Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(71,337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62,261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(700\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2017 decreased $30,967, to $49,151 compared to $80,118 in 2016, with the decrease driven by increased working capital, primarily from increased inventory.\nCash used in investing activities from continuing operations for 2017 increased $9,076, to $71,337 compared to $62,261 in 2016, with the increase primarily driven by acquisitions.

On May 18, 2016, Griffon completed an add-on offering of $125,000 principal amount of its 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022, at 98.76% of par, to Griffon's previously issued $600,000 principal amount of its 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022, at par. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nDuring 2017, the Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends each for $0.06 per share. On November 15, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.07 per share, payable on December 21, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 29, 2017.\nAs of September 30, 2017, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $26,500. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S., and we do not currently anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event we determine that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S., we will be required to accrue and pay U.S taxes to repatriate these funds (unless U.S. taxes have already been paid).\nPayments related to Telephonics revenue are received in accordance with the terms of development and production subcontracts; certain of such receipts are progress or performance based payments. With respect to HBP, uncollected receivables have been immaterial in amount.\nA small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue. In 2017:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a.\n</td> <td>The U.S. Government and its agencies, through prime and subcontractor relationships, represented 18% of Griffon's consolidated revenue and 66% of Telephonics' revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>b.\n</td> <td>Home Depot represented 17% of Griffon's consolidated revenue and 23% of HBP's revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo other customer exceeded 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon's largest customers and our relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffon's liquidity and operations.\nAt September 30, 2017, Griffon had debt, net of cash and equivalents, as follows:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and Equivalents and Debt\n</td> <td>At September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payables and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>11,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, net of current maturities\n</td> <td>968,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>896,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt discount and issuance costs\n</td> <td>13,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>992,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>926,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, net of cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>854,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn May 18, 2016, in an unregistered offering through a private placement under Rule 144A, Griffon completed the add-on offering of $125,000 principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2022, at 98.76% of par, to Griffon's previous issuance of $600,000 5.25% senior notes due in 2022, at par, which was completed on February 27, 2014 (collectively the Senior Notes\u201d). As of September 30, 2017, outstanding Senior Notes due totaled $725,000; interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. The net proceeds of the add-on offering were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under Griffon's Revolving Credit Facility (the \"Credit Agreement\").\nProceeds from the $600,000 5.25% senior notes due in 2022 were used to redeem $550,000 of 7.125% senior notes due 2018, to pay a call and tender offer premium of $31,530 and to make interest payments of $16,716, with the balance used to pay a portion of the related transaction fees and expenses. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, all obligations under the $550,000 of 7.125% senior notes due in 2018 were discharged.\nThe Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Griffon guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries, and subject to certain covenants, limitations and restrictions. On July 20, 2016 and June 18, 2014, Griffon exchanged all of the $125,000 and $600,000 Senior Notes, respectively, for substantially identical Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 via an exchange offer. The fair value of the Senior Notes approximated $737,688 on September 30, 2017 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). In connection with the issuance and exchange of the $125,000 senior notes, Griffon capitalized $3,016 of underwriting fees and other expenses, which will amortize over the term of such notes; Griffon capitalized $10,313 in connection with the previously issued $600,000 senior notes.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon completed an add-on offering of $275,000 aggregate principle amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 in an unregistered offering through a private placement. The $275,000 senior notes were issued under the same indenture pursuant to which Griffon previously issued $725,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022. As of October 2, 2017, outstanding Senior Notes due totaled $1,000,000; interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. The net proceeds of the add-on offering were used to acquire ClosetMaid, with the remaining proceeds used to pay down outstanding borrowings under Griffon's Credit Agreement.\nOn March 22, 2016, Griffon amended the Credit Agreement to increase the credit facility from $250,000 to $350,000, extend its maturity from March 13, 2020 to March 22, 2021, and modify certain other provisions of the facility. The facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility with a limit of $50,000 and a multi-currency sub-facility of $50,000. The Credit Agreement provides for same day borrowings of base rate loans. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time, subject to final maturity of the facility or the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Interest is payable on borrowings at either a LIBOR or base rate benchmark rate, in each case without a floor, plus an applicable margin, which adjusts based on financial performance. Current margins are 1.25% for base rate loans and 2.25% for LIBOR loans. The Credit Agreement has certain financial maintenance tests including a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants place limits on Griffon's ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, and make restricted payments and investments. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Griffon's material domestic subsidiaries and are secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all domestic assets of the Company and the guarantors, and a pledge of not greater than 65% of the equity interest in Griffon's material, first-tier foreign subsidiaries (except that a lien on the assets of Griffon's material domestic subsidiaries securing a limited amount of the debt under the credit agreement relating to Griffon's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") ranks pari passu with the lien granted on such assets under the Credit Agreement). On October 2, 2017, Griffon further amended the Credit Agreement to modify the maximum total leverage covenant for the quarters ending December 31, 2017, through March 31, 2019, to provide additional financial and operating flexibility. At September 30, 2017, there were $144,216 outstanding borrowings and standby letters of credit were $13,890 under the Credit Agreement; $191,894 was available, subject to certain loan covenants, for borrowing at that date.\nOn December 21, 2009, Griffon issued $100,000 principal of 4% convertible subordinated notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d). On July 14, 2016, Griffon announced that it would settle, upon conversion, up to $125,000 of the conversion value of the 2017 Notes in cash, with amounts in excess of $125,000, if any, to be settled in shares of Griffon common stock.

The mortgage loans are secured by four properties occupied by Griffon's subsidiaries. The loans mature in September 2025, and April 2018, respectively, are collateralized by the specific properties financed and are guaranteed by Griffon. The loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.50%. At September 30, 2017, mortgage loans outstanding related to continuing operations was $23,322, net of issuance costs.\nIn August 2016, Griffon's ESOP entered into an agreement that refinanced the existing ESOP loan into a new Term Loan in the amount of $35,092 (the \"Agreement\"). The Agreement also provided for a Line Note with $10,908 available to purchase shares of Griffon common stock in the open market. During 2017, Griffon's ESOP purchased 621,875 shares of common stock for a total of $10,908 or $17.54 per share, with proceeds from the Line Note. The remaining amount available on the authorization is $0. On June 30, 2017, the Term Loan and Line Note were combined into a single Term Loan. The Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%. The Term Loan requires a quarterly principal payment of $655 on September 30, 2017 and $569 thereafter, with a balloon payment due at maturity on March 22, 2020. As of September 30, 2017, $42,365, net of issuance costs, was outstanding under the Term Loan. The Term Loan is secured by shares purchased with the proceeds of the loan and with a lien on a specific amount of Griffon assets (which lien ranks pari passu with the lien granted on such assets under the Credit Agreement) and is guaranteed by Griffon.\nIn October 2006, CBP entered into a capital lease totaling $14,290 for real estate in Troy, Ohio. The lease matures in 2022, bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.0%, is secured by a mortgage on the real estate and is guaranteed by Griffon.

The term loan refinanced two existing term loans and the revolver replaced two existing lines. In December 2016, the amount available under the revolver was increased from AUD 10,000 to AUD 20,000 and, in March 2017 the term loan commitment was increased by AUD 5,000 to AUD 33,500. In September 2017, the term loan commitment was increased by AUD 15,000 to AUD 46,750. The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of AUD 1,250 plus interest, with a balloon payment of AUD 37,125 due upon maturity in June 2019, and accrues interest at Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate BBSY\u201d plus 2.00% per annum (3.76% at September 30, 2017). As of September 30, 2017, the term had an outstanding balance of AUD 45,875 ($35,943 as of September 30, 2017).

The revolver and the term loan are both secured by substantially all of the assets of Griffon Australia and its subsidiaries. Griffon guarantees the term loan. Griffon Australia is required to maintain a certain minimum equity level and is subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges cover ratio.\nOther long-term debt primarily consists of a loan with the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority and capital leases.\nAt September 30, 2017, Griffon and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the terms and covenants of its credit and loan agreements.\nOn each of March 20, 2015, July 29, 2015 and August 3, 2016, Griffon's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000 of Griffon's outstanding common stock. Under these share repurchase programs, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2017, Griffon purchased 129,000 shares of common stock under these programs, for a total of $2,201 or $17.06 per share. From August 2011 through September 30, 2017, Griffon repurchased 20,429,298 shares of its common stock, for a total of $261,621 or $12.81 per share. This includes the repurchase of 15,984,854 shares on the open market, as well as the December 10, 2013 repurchase of 4,444,444 shares from GS Direct for $50,000 or $11.25 per share. At September 30, 2017, $49,437 remains under Board repurchase authorizations.\nOn December 10, 2013, Griffon repurchased 4,444,444 shares of its common stock for $50,000 from GS Direct.

The transaction was exclusive of the Company's August 2011 $50,000 authorized share repurchase program. GS Direct continues to hold approximately 5.6 million shares of Griffon's common stock. Subject to certain exceptions, if GS Direct intends to sell its remaining shares of Griffon common stock at any time prior to December 31, 2018, it will first negotiate in good faith to sell such shares to the Company.\nIn addition to the repurchases under Board authorized programs, during 2017, 586,219 shares, with a market value of $13,640, or $23.27 per share, were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company declared and paid dividends totaling $0.24 per share, $0.20 per share and $0.16 per share, respectively.

These agreements promote investment in the country, and may be satisfied through activities that do not require Griffon to use its cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support. These agreements may also be satisfied through the use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, setting up support centers, research and development investments, acquisitions, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations, if applicable. The amount of the offset requirement is determined by contract value awarded and negotiated percentages with customers. At September 30, 2017, Telephonics had outstanding offset agreements approximating $56,000, primarily related to its Radar Systems division, some of which extend through 2029. Offset programs usually extend over several years and in some cases provide for penalties in the event Telephonics fails to perform in accordance with contract requirements. Historically, Telephonics has not been required to pay any such penalties and as of September 30, 2017, no such penalties are estimable or probable.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of Griffon's consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in public disclosures of Griffon, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions, and form the basis for estimating the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment for commitments and contingencies. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nAn estimate is considered to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact on Griffon's financial position or results of operations. The following have been identified as the most critical accounting policies and estimates:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) delivery has occurred, title has transferred or services are rendered, c) price is fixed and determinable and d) collectability is reasonably assured. Goods are sold on terms that transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location. Revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met, including transfer of title and risk of loss, which occurs either upon shipment or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide for no other significant post-shipment obligations. From time to time and for certain customers, rebates and other sales incentives, promotional allowances or discounts are offered, typically related to customer purchase volumes, all of which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue and recorded at the time of sale. Griffon provides for sales returns allowances based upon historical returns experience.\nTelephonics earns a substantial portion of its revenue as either a prime or subcontractor from contract awards with the U.S. Government, as well as non-U.S. governments and other commercial customers. These formal contracts are typically long-term in nature, usually greater than one year. Revenue and profits from these long-term fixed price contracts are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Revenue and profits on fixed-price contracts that contain engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method). Using the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less the cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods. The profit recorded on a contract using this method is equal to the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative revenue recognized, less the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract in prior periods. As this method relies on the substantial use of estimates, these projections may be revised throughout the life of a contract. Components of this formula and ratio that may be estimated include gross profit margin and total costs at\ncompletion. The cost performance and estimates to complete on long-term contracts are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis, as well as when information becomes available that would necessitate a review of the current estimate. Adjustments to estimates for a contract's estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss often are required as experience is gained, and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may or may not change, or if contract modifications occur. The impact of such adjustments or changes to estimates is made on a cumulative basis in the period when such information has become known. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, income from operations included net favorable/(unfavorable) catch-up adjustments approximating $600, $(700) and $(400), respectively. Gross profit is affected by a variety of factors, including the mix of products, systems and services, production efficiencies, price competition and general economic conditions.\nRevenue and profits on cost-reimbursable type contracts are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. The estimated profit on a cost-reimbursable contract may be fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement. Incentive and award fees on these contracts are recorded as revenue when the criteria under which they are earned are reasonably assured of being met and can be estimated.\nFor contracts whose anticipated total costs exceed total expected revenue, an estimated loss is recognized in the period when identifiable. A provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded on a cumulative basis. The estimated remaining costs to complete loss contracts, as of September 30, 2017 was $9,900 and is recorded as a reduction to gross margin on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). This loss had an immaterial impact to Griffon's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAmounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is probable, and are determined on a percentage-of-completion basis measured by the cost-to-cost method.\nFrom time to time, Telephonics may combine contracts if they are negotiated together, have specific requirements to combine, or are otherwise closely related. Contracts are segmented based on customer requirements.\nInventories\nInventories, stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average) or market, include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.\nGriffon's businesses typically do not require inventory that is susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated. In general, Telephonics sells products in connection with programs authorized and approved under contracts awarded by the U.S. Government or agencies thereof, and in accordance with customer specifications. PPC primarily produces fabricated materials used by customers in the production of their products and these materials are produced against orders from those customers. HBP produces doors and long-handled tools and landscaping products in response to orders from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders, as applicable.\nWarranty Accruals\nDirect customer and end-user warranties are provided on certain products. These warranties cover manufacturing defects that would prevent the product from performing in line with its intended and marketed use. The terms of such warranties vary by product line and generally provide for the repair or replacement of the defective product. Warranty claims data is collected and analyzed with a focus on the historical amount of claims, the products involved, the amount of time between the warranty claims and the products' respective sales and the amount of current sales. Based on such analysis, warranty accruals are recorded as an increase to cost of sales and regularly reviewed for adequacy.\nStock-based Compensation\nGriffon has issued stock-based compensation to certain employees, officers and directors in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units.\nCompensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units is recognized ratably over the required service period based on the fair value of the grant, calculated as the number of shares or units granted multiplied by the stock price on the date of grant, and for performance shares or units, the likelihood of achieving the performance criteria. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.\nAllowances for Discount, Doubtful Account and Returns\nTrade receivables are recorded at their stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers' potential insolvency), discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and estimates for returns. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers in which a risk of default has been specifically identified, as well as an amount for customer defaults, based on a formula, when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. Allowance for discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in SG&A expenses.\nAcquisitions\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in-process research and development be recorded on the balance sheet. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill, Long-Lived Intangible and Tangible Assets, and Impairment\nGriffon has significant intangible and tangible long-lived assets on its balance sheet that includes goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As required under GAAP, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually, for Griffon as of September 30, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, using discounted future cash flows for each reporting unit. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment involves significant use of judgment and assumptions in the determination of a reporting unit's fair market value. Based upon the results of the annual impairment review, it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the assets, and no impairment existed as of September 30, 2017.\nLong-lived amortizable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and software, and tangible assets, primarily Property, plant and equipment, are amortized over their expected useful lives, which involve significant assumptions and estimates. Long-lived intangible and tangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset when an impairment indicator, such as change in business, customer loss or obsolete technology, exists. With the sale of PPC, Griffon determined that there was no impairment of PPC's long-lived assets as of September 30, 2017.\nFair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a decline in Griffon's stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of Griffon's control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of Griffon's reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nRestructuring Reserves\nFrom time to time, Griffon will establish restructuring reserves at an operation. These reserves, for both termination and other exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Griffon believes the estimates made are reasonable, they could differ materially from the actual costs.\nIncome Taxes\nGriffon's effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which Griffon operates. For interim financial reporting, the annual tax rate is estimated based on projected taxable income for the full year, and a quarterly income tax provision is recorded in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year progresses, the annual tax rate is refined as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This process often results in changes to the effective tax rate throughout the year. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns\nfor which a tax benefit has been recorded in the income statement. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives. The likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed at least quarterly, and the valuation allowance, if any, is adjusted accordingly.\nTax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when, in management's judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which Griffon has recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, Griffon believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in Griffon's tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as non-current. However, if it is anticipated that a cash settlement will occur within one year, that portion of the liability is presented as current. Interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income tax expense.\nPension Benefits\nGriffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit pension plans for certain active and retired employees. Annual amounts relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases and turnover rates. The actuarial assumptions used to determine pension liabilities, assets and expense are reviewed annually and modified based on current economic conditions and trends. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans' investments and expectations for long-term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot-rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments, with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. Assumptions used in determining Griffon's obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable, based on experience and advice from independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect Griffon's financial position or results of operations.\nAll of the defined benefit plans are frozen and have ceased accruing benefits.\nNewly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to address the situation when a company modifies the terms of a stock compensation award previously granted to an employee. This guidance is effective, and should be applied prospectively, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued amendments to the Compensation - Retirement Benefits guidance which requires companies to retrospectively present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans along with other compensation costs in operating income and present the other components of net periodic benefit cost below operating income in the income statement. The guidance also allows only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within inventory or fixed assets on a prospective basis. This guidance is effective, and should be applied retroactively, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2019, including interim periods within those periods and will be effective for the Company beginning in 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the definition of a business, which will impact many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The new standard is intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods and will be effective for the Company beginning in 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance on the Statement of Cash Flows Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This guidance addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on lease accounting requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for long-term leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. This guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach to all annual and interim periods presented and is effective for the company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved, in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. This guidance permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and is effective for the Company beginning in 2019; early adoption is permitted beginning in 2018. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures. The FASB has also issued the following additional guidance clarifying certain issues on revenue from contracts with customers; Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance on Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as the classification of related matters in the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 using either prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. The Company early adopted this guidance for fiscal 2016 in order to simplify the accounting for employee share-based payments.\nUnder this guidance all excess tax benefits ( windfalls\u201d) and deficiencies ( shortfalls\u201d) related to employee stock compensation was recognized within income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2016. Under prior guidance, windfalls were recognized to Capital in excess of par value and shortfalls were only recognized to the extent they exceed the pool of windfall tax benefits. As a result of the adoption, a tax benefit of $2,193 was recognized within income tax expense reflecting the excess tax benefits for the year ended September 30, 2016. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior years.\nAdditionally, income tax benefits at settlement of an award were previously reported as a reduction to operating cash flows and an increase to financing cash flows to the extent that those benefits exceeded the income tax benefits reported in earnings during the award's vesting period. Griffon has elected to apply that change in cash flow classification on a prospective basis, which has resulted in a $2,271 increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash used in financing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the amounts previously reported. The remaining provisions of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance on simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes, requiring deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively. The Company early adopted this guidance in fiscal 2016 in order to simplify balance sheet presentation and applied it retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and related footnote disclosures. Management is required to evaluate, at each reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. This guidance was effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning in 2017; implementation of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements.", "summary": "The MD&A report provides an overview of Griffon Corporation's business activities and financial performance. It outlines the company's recent acquisitions and the planned sale of Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (PPC). The report discusses the segmented revenue and operating profit for Home & Building Products and Telephonics Corporation for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015. It also includes details about unallocated amounts, comprehensive income (loss), and discontinued operations related to PPC. The report highlights the strategic decisions and financial results of each segment, as well as key events such as acquisitions, settlements, and changes in tax provisions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years or year-end refers to the fiscal year ending September 30 and dollars are in thousands, except per share data)\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company\nGriffon Corporation (the Company\u201d or Griffon\u201d) is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.\nOn September 5, 2017, Griffon announced it will explore strategic alternatives for Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (\"PPC\") and on November 16, 2017, announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell PPC to Berry Global Group, Inc. (NYSE:BERY) (\"Berry\") for $475 million in cash. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the first quarter of calendar 2018. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the PPC business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude PPC unless otherwise noted. PPC, incorporated in 1934, is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products and sells to some of the world's largest consumer products companies. Griffon acquired PPC in 1986 as part of the acquisition of Clopay Corporation. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations to the Notes of the Financial Statements.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon acquired ClosetMaid LLC (\"ClosetMaid\"). ClosetMaid, founded in 1965, is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of closet organization, home storage, and garage storage products, and sells to some of the largest home center retail chains, mass merchandisers, and direct-to-builder professional installers in North America. Due to the acquisition of ClosetMaid occurring subsequent to Griffon's fiscal year end, ClosetMaid's results of operations, assets and liabilities were not included in Griffon's 2017 financial results or 2017 year-end balance sheet.\nGriffon currently conducts its continuing operations through two reportable segments:\n \u2022 Home & Building Products (\"HBP\") consists of three companies, The AMES Companies, Inc. ( AMES\u201d), Clopay Building Products Company, Inc. ( CBP\u201d) and ClosetMaid LLC (\"ClosetMaid\"). HBP revenue accounted for 73% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 71% in both 2016 and 2015: \n \u25e6 AMES, founded in 1774, is the leading U.S. manufacturer and a global provider of long-handled tools and landscaping products for homeowners and professionals. AMES' revenue was 36%, 35%, and 36% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u25e6 CBP, since 1964, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of residential and commercial garage doors and sells to professional dealers and some of the largest home center retail chains in North America. CBP's revenue was 37%, 36% and 35% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u25e6 ClosetMaid was acquired on October 2, 2017. ClosetMaid's 2017 revenue was $298,737, or 16% of Griffon's pro forma 2017 revenue of $1,823,734 (unaudited), giving effect to the acquisition of ClosetMaid as if it had occurred on October 1, 2016. With the inclusion of ClosetMaid, HBP pro forma revenue would have accounted for 77% of Griffon's 2017 consolidated pro forma revenue. \n \u2022 Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\"), founded in 1933, is recognized globally as a leading provider of highly sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and communications solutions for defense, aerospace and commercial customers. Telephonics' revenue was 27% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 29% in both 2016 and 2015. \nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2017 was $1,524,997, compared to $1,477,035 in the prior year, an increase of 3%, with increased revenue at Home & Building Products was partially offset by decreased revenue at Telephonics. Gross profit for 2017 was $408,116 compared to $400,693 in 2016, with gross margin as a percent of sales ( gross margin\u201d) of 26.8% and 27.1%, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations of $339,089 increased 7% from the prior year amount of $318,353. SG&A for 2017, as a percent of revenue, was 22.2%, compared to 21.6% in the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of $9,617 of acquisition related expenditures.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2017 of $51,513 increased 3% compared to the prior year of $49,943 primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the May 2016 add-on offering of $125,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 and higher outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOther income (expense) from continuing operations of $(880) in 2017 and $(250) in 2016 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $16,698 for the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $32,213 for the prior year. In 2017, the Company recognized a tax benefit of (6.5)% compared to a tax provision of 38.6% in 2016. The 2017 tax rates included $8,274 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense, a federal domestic production activities deduction and a federal R&D credit. The 2016 tax rates included an $857 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense and the release of unrecognized tax benefits.\nExcluding the discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, and certain other items from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were 39.7% and 41.3%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $17,783, or $0.41 per share, for 2017 compared to $19,781, or $0.45 per share in the prior year.\nThe current year results included the following from continuing operations:\n - Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share); \n - Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); and \n - Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $8,274, or $0.19 per share. \nThe prior year results included discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $857 or $0.02 per share from continuing operations.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2017 Income from continuing operations would have been $18,954, or $0.44 per share compared to $18,924, or $0.43 per share, in 2016.\nNet income was $14,912, or $0.35 per share, for 2017 compared to $30,010, or $0.68 per share in the prior year.\nThe current year results included the following:\n - Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share); \n - Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); \n - Environmental and warranty reserves of $5,700 ($3,703, net of tax, or $0.09 per share); and \n - Discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, of $9,385, or $0.22 per share.  The prior year results included the following:\n - Restructuring charges of $5,900 ($4,247 net of tax, or $0.10 per share); and \n - Discrete and certain other tax provisions $2,658 or $0.06 per share. \nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2017 Net income would have been $37,445, or $0.87 per share compared to $36,915, or $0.84 per share, in 2016.\nThe tax provisions on all pre-tax income inclusive of discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 resulted in tax rates of 61.7% and 43.6%, respectively. These 2017 and 2016 tax rates included $9,385 and $2,658, respectively, of discrete and certain other tax provisions. Excluding these tax items and certain other items, as listed above, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were 37.0% and 37.5%, respectively.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2016 of $1,477,035 was in line with the $1,483,291 in the prior year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency at HBP, revenue trailed the prior year by 1%. Gross profit from continuing operations for 2016 was $400,693 compared to $392,347 in 2015, with gross margin of 27.1% and 26.5%, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations for 2016 of $318,353 decreased 2% from the prior year amount of $325,435. SG&A for 2016, as a percent of revenue, was 21.6%, compared to 21.9% in the prior year due to plant and distribution center consolidations and management cost control measures in the HBP segment.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2016 totaled $49,943, a 5% increase from the prior year primarily due to the May 2016 add-on offering of $125,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022.\nOther income (expense) of $(250) in 2016 and $(331) in 2015 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $32,213 for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to $19,066 for the prior year. In 2016, the Company recognized a tax provision of 38.6% compared to 35.5% in 2015. The 2016 tax rates included $857 of net discrete tax benefits related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense. The 2015 tax rate included a net discrete benefit of $219.\nExcluding the above discrete tax and certain other items, from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 41.3% and 36.7%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $19,781, or $0.45 per share, for 2016 compared to $12,294, or $0.26 per share in the prior year. The 2016 results included a discrete tax benefit, net, of $(857) or $(0.02) per share. The 2015 results included discrete tax benefits, net, of $(219) or $0.00 per share. Excluding discrete items from both reporting periods, 2016 Income from continuing operations would have been $18,924, or $0.43 per share compared to $12,075, or $0.26 per share, in 2015.\nNet income was $30,010, or $0.68 per share, for 2016 compared to $34,289, or $0.73 per share in the prior year.\nThe 2016 results included the following:\n - Restructuring charges of $5,900 ($4,247, net of tax, or $0.10 per share); and \n - Discrete tax provisions, net, of $2,658 or $0.06 per share. \nThe 2015 results included discrete tax benefits, net, of $(62) or $0.00 per share.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2016 Net income would have been $36,915, or $0.84 per share compared to $34,227, or $0.73 per share, in 2015.\nGriffon evaluates performance based on Earnings per share and Net income excluding restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment, acquisition related expenses, discrete and certain other tax items, as well other items that may affect comparability, as applicable. Griffon believes this information is useful to investors for the same reason.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Income from continuing operations to Adjusted income from continuing operations and Earnings per common share from continuing operations to Adjusted earnings per common share from continuing operations:\nGRIFFON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nTO ADJUSTED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted net income and Earnings per common share to Adjusted earnings per common share:\nGRIFFON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME\nTO ADJUSTED NET INCOME\n(Unaudited)\n\nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Segment operating profit to Income (loss) before taxes and discontinued operations:\n\nGriffon evaluates performance and allocates resources based on each segment's operating results from continuing operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, unallocated amounts (mainly corporate overhead), restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment and acquisition related expenses, as well as other items that may affect comparability, as applicable ( Segment adjusted EBITDA\u201d, a non-GAAP measure). Griffon believes this information is useful to investors.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Segment adjusted EBITDA to Income (loss) before taxes and discontinued operations:\n\nHome & Building Products\n\n2017 Compared to 2016\nSegment revenue increased $71,927, or 7%, compared to the prior year period. AMES revenue increased 6%, primarily due to increased UK market expansion and contributions from the La Hacienda and Hills acquisitions, and increased Canadian snow and lawn tools sales. CBP revenue increased 8% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased volume, pricing and favorable mix.\nSegment operating profit in 2017 was $89,495 compared to $79,682 in 2016, an increase of $9,813, or 12% driven by the increased revenue noted above and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased steel and resin costs. Segment depreciation and amortization increased $1,280 from the prior year period.\nOn November 6, 2017, AMES acquired Harper Brush Works ( Harper\u201d), a division of Horizon Global, for approximately $5,000. Harper is a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use. The acquisition will broaden AMES' long-handle tool offering in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning tools and accessories. The acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $10,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon completed the acquisition of ClosetMaid, a market leader of home storage and organization products, for approximately $200,000, or $175,000 inclusive of the net present value of tax benefits. ClosetMaid adds to Griffon's Home and Building Products segment, complementing and diversifying Griffon's portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. ClosetMaid is expected to generate approximately $300,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn September 29, 2017, AMES Australia completed the acquisition of Tuscan Landscape Group Pty, Ltd. (\"Tuscan Path\"), a leading Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden decor products, for approximately $18,000 (AUD 22,250). The acquisition of Tuscan Path broadens AMES' outdoor living and lawn and garden business, and will strengthen AMES' industry leading position in Australia. Tuscan Path is expected to generate approximately AUD 25,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn July 31, 2017, The AMES Companies, Inc. acquired La Hacienda Limited, a leading United Kingdom outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden decor products, for approximately $11,400 (GBP 9,175). The acquisition of La Hacienda broadens AMES' global outdoor living and lawn and garden business and supports AMES' UK expansion strategy. La Hacienda is expected to generate approximately GBP 14,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn December 30, 2016, AMES Australia acquired Home Living (\"Hills\") for approximately $6,051 (AUD 8,400). Hills, founded in 1946, is a market leader in the supply of clothesline, laundry and garden products. The Hills acquisition adds to AMES' existing broad category of products and enhances its lawn and garden product offerings in Australia. Hills is expected to generate approximately AUD 10,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after acquisition.\nOn February 14, 2016, AMES Australia acquired substantially all of the Intellectual Property (IP) assets of Australia-based Nylex Plastics Pty Ltd. for $1,744 (AUD 2,452). Through this acquisition, AMES and Griffon secured the ownership of the trademark Nylex\u201d for certain categories of AMES products, principally in the country of Australia. Previously, the Nylex name was licensed. The acquisition of the Nylex IP was contemplated as a post-closing activity of the Cyclone acquisition and supports AMES' Australian watering products strategy.\nOn October 15, 2015, CBP announced plans to expand its manufacturing facility in Troy, Ohio. In the second quarter of 2017, CBP completed this 250,000 square foot expansion of its state-of-the-art facility, which reflects increased customer demand for its core products, and CBP's success in bringing new technologies to market. The Troy facility now has 1.23 million square feet of combined manufacturing and office space. CBP's Russia, Ohio facility provides additional production capacity, particularly for specialized and custom products.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nSegment revenue decreased $10,858, or 1%, compared to the prior year period. Excluding a $14,900 or 1% unfavorable foreign currency impact, revenue remained consistent with the prior year period. AMES revenue decreased 4%, mainly driven by a combination of a warm winter and a cold and wet spring in both the U.S. and Canada, resulting in reduced snow and spring tool category sales, respectively, partially offset by improved sales of North American pots and planters and increased product offerings in Australia; foreign currency was 2% unfavorable. CBP revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to improved volume and favorable mix; the impact of foreign currency was not material.\nSegment operating profit in 2016 was $79,682 compared to $58,883 in 2015, an increase of $20,799, or 35% driven by operational efficiency improvements, cost control measures at AMES and increased volume and favorable mix at CBP and decreased material costs, which more than offset the impact of reduced revenue at AMES; foreign currency was 4% unfavorable. Segment depreciation and amortization remained consistent with the prior year.\nTelephonics\n\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue in 2017 decreased $23,965, or 6%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreased multi-mode radar revenue and certain ground surveillance systems, partially offset by favorable performance on electronic countermeasure systems revenue.\nSegment operating profit decreased $12,858 from the prior year period. During 2017, Telephonics recorded a $5,137 charge, consisting of a settlement in the amount of $4,250 plus 2% interest and associated legal costs, related to certain amounts the civil division of the US Department of Justice indicated it believed it was owed from Telephonics with respect to certain US government contracts, performed during the 2005 to 2013 time period, in which Telephonics acted as a subcontractor. Excluding these charges, segment operating profit in the current year would have been $35,080, a $7,721 decrease from the prior year period primarily due to the decreased revenue noted above, unfavorable program mix and the impact of revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain radar and communication programs.\nDuring 2017, Telephonics was awarded several new contracts and incremental funding on existing contracts approximating $342,400. Contract backlog was $350,900 at September 30, 2017 with 70% expected to be fulfilled in the next 12 months; backlog was $420,000 at September 30, 2016. Backlog is defined as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer or Congress, in the case of the U.S. government agencies. The decrease in backlog was primarily due to the timing of various U.S. and international contract awards associated with radar and surveillance opportunities.\nIn December 2015, Telephonics invested an additional $2,726 increasing its equity stake from 26% to 49% in Mahindra Telephonics Integrated Systems (MTIS), a joint venture with Mahindra Defence Systems, a Mahindra Group Company. MTIS is an aerospace and defense manufacturing and development facility in Prithla, India.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenue in 2016 increased $4,602, or 1%, compared to the prior year period, due to mobile ground surveillance systems and dismounted Electronic Countermeasure systems, partially offset by airborne maritime and Identification Friend or Foe (\"IFF\") radar systems.\nSegment operating profit remained consistent with the prior year period.\nUnallocated Amounts\nFor 2017, unallocated amounts, consisting primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $42,398 compared to $40,393 in 2016, with the increase primarily due to compensation and incentive costs.\nFor 2016, unallocated amounts, which consist primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $40,393 compared to $35,308 in 2015 primarily due to expenses related to the pursuit of acquisition opportunities, expenses relating to an intellectual property legal claim (in which Griffon is the plaintiff) and increased insurance costs.\nSegment Depreciation and Amortization\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $47,398 in 2017 compared to the prior year of $45,851, increased $1,547 primarily due to depreciation for new assets placed in service.\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $45,851 in 2016 remained consistent with the prior year of $45,365.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nDuring 2017, total other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $20,760 consisted of a $10,667 income on Foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, Canadian, British Pound, Brazilian and Australian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar, a $9,203 gain from Pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to higher assumed discount rates compared to the prior year and a $890 gain on cash flow hedges.\nDuring 2016, total other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $9,947 consisted of a $17,284 income on Foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, Canadian, Brazilian and Australian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar, a $5,651 loss from Pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to lower assumed discount rates compared to the prior year and a $1,686 loss on cash flow hedges.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nPlastic Products Company\nOn September 5, 2017, Griffon announced it will explore strategic alternatives for Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (\"PPC\") and on November 16, 2017, announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell PPC to Berry for $475 million in cash. As a result, the following PPC results have been classified PPC as a discontinued operation.\n\n2017", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years or year-end refers to the fiscal year ending September 30 and dollars are in thousands, except per share data)\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company\nGriffon Corporation (the Company\u201d or Griffon\u201d) is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.\nOn September 5, 2017, Griffon announced it will explore strategic alternatives for Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (\"PPC\") and on November 16, 2017, announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell PPC to Berry Global Group, Inc. (NYSE:BERY) (\"Berry\") for $475 million in cash. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the first quarter of calendar 2018. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the PPC business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude PPC unless otherwise noted. PPC, incorporated in 1934, is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products and sells to some of the world's largest consumer products companies. Griffon acquired PPC in 1986 as part of the acquisition of Clopay Corporation. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations to the Notes of the Financial Statements.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon acquired ClosetMaid LLC (\"ClosetMaid\"). ClosetMaid, founded in 1965, is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of closet organization, home storage, and garage storage products, and sells to some of the largest home center retail chains, mass merchandisers, and direct-to-builder professional installers in North America. Due to the acquisition of ClosetMaid occurring subsequent to Griffon's fiscal year end, ClosetMaid's results of operations, assets and liabilities were not included in Griffon's 2017 financial results or 2017 year-end balance sheet.\nGriffon currently conducts its continuing operations through two reportable segments:\n \u2022 Home & Building Products (\"HBP\") consists of three companies, The AMES Companies, Inc. ( AMES\u201d), Clopay Building Products Company, Inc. ( CBP\u201d) and ClosetMaid LLC (\"ClosetMaid\"). HBP revenue accounted for 73% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 71% in both 2016 and 2015: \n \u25e6 AMES, founded in 1774, is the leading U.S. manufacturer and a global provider of long-handled tools and landscaping products for homeowners and professionals. AMES' revenue was 36%, 35%, and 36% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u25e6 CBP, since 1964, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of residential and commercial garage doors and sells to professional dealers and some of the largest home center retail chains in North America. CBP's revenue was 37%, 36% and 35% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n \u25e6 ClosetMaid was acquired on October 2, 2017. ClosetMaid's 2017 revenue was $298,737, or 16% of Griffon's pro forma 2017 revenue of $1,823,734 (unaudited), giving effect to the acquisition of ClosetMaid as if it had occurred on October 1, 2016. With the inclusion of ClosetMaid, HBP pro forma revenue would have accounted for 77% of Griffon's 2017 consolidated pro forma revenue. \n \u2022 Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\"), founded in 1933, is recognized globally as a leading provider of highly sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and communications solutions for defense, aerospace and commercial customers. Telephonics' revenue was 27% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 29% in both 2016 and 2015. \nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2017 was $1,524,997, compared to $1,477,035 in the prior year, an increase of 3%, with increased revenue at Home & Building Products was partially offset by decreased revenue at Telephonics. Gross profit for 2017 was $408,116 compared to $400,693 in 2016, with gross margin as a percent of sales ( gross margin\u201d) of 26.8% and 27.1%, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations of $339,089 increased 7% from the prior year amount of $318,353. SG&A for 2017, as a percent of revenue, was 22.2%, compared to 21.6% in the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of $9,617 of acquisition related expenditures.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2017 of $51,513 increased 3% compared to the prior year of $49,943 primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the May 2016 add-on offering of $125,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 and higher outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOther income (expense) from continuing operations of $(880) in 2017 and $(250) in 2016 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $16,698 for the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $32,213 for the prior year. In 2017, the Company recognized a tax benefit of (6.5)% compared to a tax provision of 38.6% in 2016. The 2017 tax rates included $8,274 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense, a federal domestic production activities deduction and a federal R&D credit. The 2016 tax rates included an $857 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense and the release of unrecognized tax benefits.\nExcluding the discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, and certain other items from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were 39.7% and 41.3%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $17,783, or $0.41 per share, for 2017 compared to $19,781, or $0.45 per share in the prior year.\nThe current year results included the following from continuing operations:\n - Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share); \n - Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); and \n - Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $8,274, or $0.19 per share. \nThe prior year results included discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $857 or $0.02 per share from continuing operations.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2017 Income from continuing operations would have been $18,954, or $0.44 per share compared to $18,924, or $0.43 per share, in 2016.\nNet income was $14,912, or $0.35 per share, for 2017 compared to $30,010, or $0.68 per share in the prior year.\nThe current year results included the following:\n - Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share); \n - Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); \n - Environmental and warranty reserves of $5,700 ($3,703, net of tax, or $0.09 per share); and \n - Discrete and certain other tax provisions, net, of $9,385, or $0.22 per share.

These 2017 and 2016 tax rates included $9,385 and $2,658, respectively, of discrete and certain other tax provisions. Excluding these tax items and certain other items, as listed above, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were 37.0% and 37.5%, respectively.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2016 of $1,477,035 was in line with the $1,483,291 in the prior year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency at HBP, revenue trailed the prior year by 1%. Gross profit from continuing operations for 2016 was $400,693 compared to $392,347 in 2015, with gross margin of 27.1% and 26.5%, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations for 2016 of $318,353 decreased 2% from the prior year amount of $325,435. SG&A for 2016, as a percent of revenue, was 21.6%, compared to 21.9% in the prior year due to plant and distribution center consolidations and management cost control measures in the HBP segment.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2016 totaled $49,943, a 5% increase from the prior year primarily due to the May 2016 add-on offering of $125,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022.\nOther income (expense) of $(250) in 2016 and $(331) in 2015 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $32,213 for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to $19,066 for the prior year.

The 2015 tax rate included a net discrete benefit of $219.\nExcluding the above discrete tax and certain other items, from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 41.3% and 36.7%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $19,781, or $0.45 per share, for 2016 compared to $12,294, or $0.26 per share in the prior year.

AMES revenue increased 6%, primarily due to increased UK market expansion and contributions from the La Hacienda and Hills acquisitions, and increased Canadian snow and lawn tools sales. CBP revenue increased 8% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased volume, pricing and favorable mix.\nSegment operating profit in 2017 was $89,495 compared to $79,682 in 2016, an increase of $9,813, or 12% driven by the increased revenue noted above and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased steel and resin costs. Segment depreciation and amortization increased $1,280 from the prior year period.\nOn November 6, 2017, AMES acquired Harper Brush Works ( Harper\u201d), a division of Horizon Global, for approximately $5,000. Harper is a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use. The acquisition will broaden AMES' long-handle tool offering in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning tools and accessories. The acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $10,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon completed the acquisition of ClosetMaid, a market leader of home storage and organization products, for approximately $200,000, or $175,000 inclusive of the net present value of tax benefits. ClosetMaid adds to Griffon's Home and Building Products segment, complementing and diversifying Griffon's portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. ClosetMaid is expected to generate approximately $300,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn September 29, 2017, AMES Australia completed the acquisition of Tuscan Landscape Group Pty, Ltd. (\"Tuscan Path\"), a leading Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden decor products, for approximately $18,000 (AUD 22,250). The acquisition of Tuscan Path broadens AMES' outdoor living and lawn and garden business, and will strengthen AMES' industry leading position in Australia. Tuscan Path is expected to generate approximately AUD 25,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn July 31, 2017, The AMES Companies, Inc. acquired La Hacienda Limited, a leading United Kingdom outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden decor products, for approximately $11,400 (GBP 9,175). The acquisition of La Hacienda broadens AMES' global outdoor living and lawn and garden business and supports AMES' UK expansion strategy. La Hacienda is expected to generate approximately GBP 14,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn December 30, 2016, AMES Australia acquired Home Living (\"Hills\") for approximately $6,051 (AUD 8,400). Hills, founded in 1946, is a market leader in the supply of clothesline, laundry and garden products. The Hills acquisition adds to AMES' existing broad category of products and enhances its lawn and garden product offerings in Australia. Hills is expected to generate approximately AUD 10,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after acquisition.\nOn February 14, 2016, AMES Australia acquired substantially all of the Intellectual Property (IP) assets of Australia-based Nylex Plastics Pty Ltd. for $1,744 (AUD 2,452). Through this acquisition, AMES and Griffon secured the ownership of the trademark Nylex\u201d for certain categories of AMES products, principally in the country of Australia. Previously, the Nylex name was licensed. The acquisition of the Nylex IP was contemplated as a post-closing activity of the Cyclone acquisition and supports AMES' Australian watering products strategy.\nOn October 15, 2015, CBP announced plans to expand its manufacturing facility in Troy, Ohio. In the second quarter of 2017, CBP completed this 250,000 square foot expansion of its state-of-the-art facility, which reflects increased customer demand for its core products, and CBP's success in bringing new technologies to market. The Troy facility now has 1.23 million square feet of combined manufacturing and office space. CBP's Russia, Ohio facility provides additional production capacity, particularly for specialized and custom products.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nSegment revenue decreased $10,858, or 1%, compared to the prior year period. Excluding a $14,900 or 1% unfavorable foreign currency impact, revenue remained consistent with the prior year period. AMES revenue decreased 4%, mainly driven by a combination of a warm winter and a cold and wet spring in both the U.S. and Canada, resulting in reduced snow and spring tool category sales, respectively, partially offset by improved sales of North American pots and planters and increased product offerings in Australia; foreign currency was 2% unfavorable. CBP revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to improved volume and favorable mix; the impact of foreign currency was not material.\nSegment operating profit in 2016 was $79,682 compared to $58,883 in 2015, an increase of $20,799, or 35% driven by operational efficiency improvements, cost control measures at AMES and increased volume and favorable mix at CBP and decreased material costs, which more than offset the impact of reduced revenue at AMES; foreign currency was 4% unfavorable. Segment depreciation and amortization remained consistent with the prior year.\nTelephonics\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>10,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract settlement charges\n</td> <td>5,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue in 2017 decreased $23,965, or 6%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreased multi-mode radar revenue and certain ground surveillance systems, partially offset by favorable performance on electronic countermeasure systems revenue.\nSegment operating profit decreased $12,858 from the prior year period. During 2017, Telephonics recorded a $5,137 charge, consisting of a settlement in the amount of $4,250 plus 2% interest and associated legal costs, related to certain amounts the civil division of the US Department of Justice indicated it believed it was owed from Telephonics with respect to certain US government contracts, performed during the 2005 to 2013 time period, in which Telephonics acted as a subcontractor. Excluding these charges, segment operating profit in the current year would have been $35,080, a $7,721 decrease from the prior year period primarily due to the decreased revenue noted above, unfavorable program mix and the impact of revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain radar and communication programs.\nDuring 2017, Telephonics was awarded several new contracts and incremental funding on existing contracts approximating $342,400. Contract backlog was $350,900 at September 30, 2017 with 70% expected to be fulfilled in the next 12 months; backlog was $420,000 at September 30, 2016. Backlog is defined as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer or Congress, in the case of the U.S. government agencies.
