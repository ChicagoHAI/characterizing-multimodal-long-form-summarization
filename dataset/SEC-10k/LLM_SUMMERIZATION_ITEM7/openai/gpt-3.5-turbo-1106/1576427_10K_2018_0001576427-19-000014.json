Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global technology company building the leading Advertising Platform for the Open Internet. We strive to deliver impactful business results at scale to commerce companies and consumer brands by meeting their multiple marketing goals at their targeted return on investment. Using shopping data, predictive technology and large consumer reach, we help our clients drive Awareness, Consideration and Conversion for their products and services1, and help retailers generate advertising revenues from consumer brands. Our data is pooled among our clients and offers deep insights into consumer intent and purchasing habits. To drive measurable results for clients, we activate our data assets through proprietary AI technology to engage consumers in real time through the pricing and delivery of highly relevant digital advertisements, across devices and environments. By pricing our offering on a range of pricing models and measuring our value based on clear, well-defined performance metrics, we make the return on investment transparent and easy to measure for advertisers.\nOur clients include some of the largest and most sophisticated commerce companies in the world, along with world-class consumer brands. We partner with them to capture user activity on their websites and mobile applications (\"apps\"), which we define as digital properties, and optimize the performance of their ads based on that activity and other data. Demonstrating the depth and scale of our data, we collected data on over $800 billion in online sales transactions2 on our clients' digital properties in the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on this data and other assets, we delivered targeted ads that generated over 10 billion clicks2 in the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we served more than 19,000 clients and, in each of the last three years, our average client retention rate, as measured on a quarterly basis, was approximately 90%2. We serve a wide range of clients and our revenue is not concentrated within any single client or group of clients. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, our largest client represented 2.0%, 1.9% and 2.0% of our revenue, respectively, and in 2018, our largest 10 clients represented 11.7% of our revenue in the aggregate. There is no group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other constituting an aggregate amount equal to 10% or more of our consolidated revenues, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Advertising Platform for the Open Internet is currently comprised of two families of solutions: Criteo Marketing Solutions and Criteo Retail Media. All products leverage the same technology in the Criteo AI Engine.\nWe operate in 98 countries through a network of 31 offices located in Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA), the Americas and Asia-Pacific. As a result of our significant international operations, our revenue from outside of France, our home country, accounted for 93.3% of our revenue for year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's foreign currency risk exposure to the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real and the U.S dollar against the euro (the euro still remains the Group's functional currency) is described in Item 7 note B. Liquidity and Capital Resources to our Management's Discussion and Analysis included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n___________________________________________________\n1 Driving Awareness for a brand means exposing its brand name to consumers who have not been in touch with the brand before, thereby creating brand awareness from such consumers. Driving Consideration for an advertiser's products or services means attracting prospective new consumers to consider engaging with and/or buying this advertiser's products or services. Driving Conversion for an advertisers' products or services means triggering a purchase by consumers who have already engaged with this advertisers products or services in the past.\n2 Excluding Criteo Retail Media\nOur financial results include:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue of $1,799.1 million, $2,296.7 million and 2,300.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue ex-TAC, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $730.2 million, $941.1 million and $966.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net Income of $87.3 million, $96.7 million and $95.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $224.6 million, $309.6 million and $321.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPlease see footnotes 3, 4 and 5 to the Other Financial and Operating Data table in Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d in this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of Revenue to Revenue ex-TAC, Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income to Adjusted Net Income respectively, in each case the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or \"U.S. GAAP\".\nWe are focused on maximizing Revenue ex-TAC. We believe this focus builds sustainable long-term value for our business and fortifies a number of our competitive strengths, including a highly liquid marketplace for Display Advertising. As part of this focus, we seek to maximize our percentage of overall marketing spend in the Display Advertising market over the long-term. In addition, this focus enriches liquidity for both advertisers and publishers resulting in more effective advertising for clients, better monetization for publishers and more relevant advertisements for consumers. We believe our results of operations reflect this focus.\nAcquisitions\nOn October 29, 2018, we acquired Manage, a Silicon Valley-based company with an attractive app install advertising solution.\nOn August 3, 2018, we acquired Storetail, a Paris-based pioneering retail media technology platform enabling retailers to monetize native placements on their ecommerce sites.\nOn November 9, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Hooklogic, a New York-based company connecting many of the world's largest ecommerce retailers with consumer brands. We now offer HookLogic's products under the \"Criteo Sponsored Products\" name.\nOn May 31, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Monsieur Drive, a Paris-based company building advertising products for the consumer packaged goods vertical.\nTransition to U.S. GAAP and Change in Reporting Currency\nAs of June 30, 2015, we no longer met the requirements to qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act. As a result, we began reporting as a domestic registrant as of January 1, 2016 and we are required under current SEC rules to prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, rather than IFRS, and to present our financial information in U.S. dollars instead of euros. The transition from consolidated financial statements under IFRS to U.S. GAAP only impacted the presentation of our consolidated statement of financial position (order of liquidity) and of our consolidated statement of cash flows (effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents). The functional currency of the Company remains the euro, while our reporting currency changed from the euro to the U.S. dollar. Consequently, since we incur portions of our expenses and derive revenues in currencies other than the euro, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange risk exposure also arises from intra-company transactions and financing with subsidiaries that have a functional currency different than the euro.\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A.\n</td> <td>Operating Results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Basis of Presentation\nThe key elements of our results of operations include:\nRevenue\nWe sell personalized display advertisements featuring product-level recommendations either directly to clients or to advertising agencies. Historically, the Criteo model has focused solely on converting our clients' website visitors into customers, enabling us to charge our clients only when users engage with an ad we deliver, usually by clicking on it. More recently, we have expanded our solutions to address a broader range of marketing goals for our clients.\nWe offer two families of solutions to our commerce and brand clients:\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Criteo Marketing Solutions allow commerce companies to address multiple marketing goals by engaging their consumers with personalized ads across the web, mobile and offline store environments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Criteo Retail Media solutions allow retailers to generate advertising revenues from consumer brands, and/or to drive sales for themselves, by monetizing their data and audiences through personalized ads, either on their own digital property or on the open Internet, that address multiple marketing goals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In conjunction with expanding our solutions, we have also started expanding our pricing models to now include a combination of cost-per-install and cost-per-impression for selected new solutions, in addition to cost-per-click.\nWe recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised services directly to our clients or to advertising agencies, which we collectively refer to as our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-click and cost-per-install basis, we bill our clients when a user clicks on an advertisement we deliver or installs an application by clicking on an advertisement we delivered, respectively. For these pricing models, we recognize revenue when a user clicks on an advertisement or installs an application.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-impression basis, we bill our clients based on the number of times an advertisement is displayed to an user. For this pricing model, we recognize revenue when an advertisement is displayed.\nWe act as principal in our arrangements because (i) we control the advertising inventory (spaces on websites) before it is transferred to our clients; (ii) we bear sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising promise and inventory risks and (iii) we have full discretion in establishing prices. Therefore, based on these factors, we report revenue earned and the related costs incurred on a gross basis.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue primarily includes traffic acquisition costs and other cost of revenue.\nTraffic Acquisition Costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist primarily of purchases of impressions from publishers on a CPM basis. We purchase impressions directly from publishers or third-party intermediaries, such as advertisement exchanges. We recognize cost of revenue on a publisher by publisher basis as incurred. Costs owed to publishers but not yet paid are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as trade payables.\nFor some solutions within Criteo Retail Media, we pay for the inventory of our retailer partners on a revenue sharing basis, effectively paying the retailers a portion of the click-based revenue generated by user clicks on the sponsored products advertisements displaying the products of our consumer brand clients.\nFor a discussion of the trends we expect to see in traffic acquisition costs, see the section entitled \" - Highlights and Trends - Revenue ex-TAC\" in Item 7.D - Trend Information below.\nOther Cost of Revenue. Other cost of revenue includes expenses related to third-party hosting fees, depreciation of data center equipment and the cost of data purchased from third parties. The Company does not build or operate its own data centers and none of its Research and Development employments are dedicated to revenue generating activities. As a result, we do not include the costs of such personnel in other cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and operations, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation, pension benefits and other personnel-related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories. We grew from 1,841 employees at January 1, 2016 to 2,744 employees at December 31, 2018, and we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees in order to support our anticipated revenue growth.\nWe include equity awards compensation expense in connection with grants of share options, warrants, and restricted share units (\"RSUs\") in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient's function (Research and development, Sales and operations, General and administrative).\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our employees working in the engine, platform, site reliability engineering, scalability, infrastructure, engineering program management, product, analytics and other teams, including salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation and other personnel related costs. Our research and development function was supplemented in January 2013 to include a dedicated product organization following the appointment of a Chief Product Officer. Also included are non-personnel costs such as subcontracting, consulting and professional fees to third-party development resources, allocated overhead and depreciation and amortization costs. These expenses are partially offset by the French research tax credit that is conditional upon the level of our expenditures in research and development.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the performance of our solution and improving the efficiency of the services we deliver to our clients and publisher partners. All development costs, principally headcount-related costs, are expensed as management determines that technological feasibility is reached, shortly before the release of the developed products or features. As a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products or features are not material and, accordingly, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs mainly relates to internally developed internal-use software and IT licenses.\nThe number of employees in research and development functions grew from 399 at January 1, 2016 to 675 at December 31, 2018. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but remain fairly constant as a percentage of our revenue. We believe our continued investment in research and development to be critical to maintaining and improving our technology within the Advertising Platform for the Open Internet, our quality of service and our competitive position.\nSales and Operations Expense. Sales and operations expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our employees working in our sales, account strategy, sales operations, publisher business development, analytics, marketing, technical solutions, creative services and other teams, including salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation, and other personnel-related costs. Additional expenses in this category include travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, marketing activities, provisions for doubtful accounts, subcontracting, consulting and professional fees paid to third parties, allocated overhead and depreciation and amortization costs. The number of employees in sales and operations functions grew from 1,124 at January 1, 2016 to 1,574 at December 31, 2018. In order to continue to grow our business, geographic footprint and brand awareness, we expect to continue to invest in our resources in sales and operations, in particular by increasing the number of sales and account strategy teams in low penetrated geographic markets and in our midmarket organization. As a result, we expect sales and operations expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we invest to acquire new clients, retain existing ones and grow revenue from existing clients, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we scale and automate our operational processes, and increase the productivity of our sales and operations teams.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation, pension benefits and other personnel-related costs for our administrative, legal, information technology, human resources, facilities and finance teams. Additional expenses included in this category include travel-related expenses, subcontracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance and other corporate expenses, along with allocated overhead and depreciation and amortization costs. The number of employees in general and administrative functions grew from 318 at January 1, 2016 to 495 at December 31, 2018. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our growth, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we scale and increase the productivity of our general and administrative teams.\nFinancial Income (Expense)\nFinancial income (expense) primarily consists of:\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation into local currency of monetary balance sheet items labeled in euros (the Company's functional currency). We are exposed to changes in exchange rates primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Brazil. The U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real are our most significant foreign currency exchange risks. At December 31, 2018, our exposure to foreign currency risk was centralized at parent company level and hedged. These exchange differences in euro are then translated into U.S. dollars (the Company's reporting currency) according to the average euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our debt loan agreements and revolving credit facilities (\"RCFs\").\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We monitor foreign currency exposure and look to mitigate exposures through normal business operations and hedging strategies.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to potential income taxes in France, the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. We recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities, notwithstanding our belief that our tax return positions are supportable.\nOur effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate applicable to us primarily due to valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, differences between domestic and foreign jurisdiction tax rates, Research Tax Credit offsets, which are non-taxable items, potential tax audit provision settlements, share-based compensation expenses that are non-deductible in some jurisdictions under certain circumstances, and transfer pricing adjustments. We license access to our technology to our subsidiaries and charge a royalty fee to these subsidiaries for such access. In France, we benefit from a reduced tax rate of 15% on a large portion of this technology royalty income.\nOn September 27, 2017, we received a draft notice of proposed adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") audit of Criteo Corp. for the year ended December 31, 2014, confirmed by the definitive notice dated February 8, 2018. If the IRS prevails in its position, it could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated maximum aggregate amount of $15.0 million, excluding relative fees, interest and penalties. We strongly disagree with the IRS's position as asserted in the draft notice of proposed adjustment and intend to contest it.\nNo uncertain tax positions were identified as of December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue, assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe estimates associated with revenue recognition, trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions, impact of tax reforms in the U.S., goodwill and intangible assets, internal-use software and equity awards compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. See Note 1. Principles and Accounting Methods to our audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page for a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised services directly to our clients or to advertising agencies, which we collectively refer to as our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-click and cost-per-install basis, we bill our clients when a user clicks on an advertisement we deliver or installs an application by clicking on an advertisement we delivered, respectively. For these pricing models, we recognize revenue when a user clicks on an advertisement or installs an application.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-impression basis, we bill our clients based on the number of times an advertisement is displayed to a user. For this pricing model, we recognize revenue when an advertisement is displayed.\nWe act as principal in our arrangements because (i) we control the advertising inventory (spaces on websites) before it is transferred to our clients; (ii) we bear sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising promise and inventory risks and (iii) we have full discretion in establishing prices. Therefore, based on these factors, we report revenue earned and the related costs incurred on a gross basis.\nTrade Receivables, Net of Allowances for Doubtful Accounts\nWe carry our accounts receivable at net realizable value. On a periodic basis, our management evaluates our accounts receivable and determines whether to provide an allowance or if any accounts should be written down and charged to expense as a bad debt. The evaluation is based on a past history of collections, current credit conditions, the length of time the trade receivable is past due and a past history of write downs. A trade receivable is considered past due if we have not received payments based on agreed-upon terms. A higher default rate than estimated or a deterioration in our major clients' creditworthiness could have an adverse impact on our future results. Allowances for doubtful accounts on trade receivables are recorded in Sales and Operations\u201d in our consolidated statements of income. We generally do not require any security or collateral to support our trade receivables. The amount of allowance for doubtful accounts charged to our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 was $9.9 million, $13.3 million and $17.7 million, respectively and represented 2.5%, 2.7% and 3.7% of our trade receivables, net of allowances, as of December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDeferred taxes are recorded on all temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and on tax losses, using the liability method. Differences are defined as temporary when they are expected to reverse within a foreseeable future. We may only recognize deferred tax assets if, based on the projected taxable incomes within the next three years, we determine that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and tax credits can be utilized. As a result, the measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits which are not expected to be realized. If future taxable profits are\nconsiderably different from those forecasted that support recording deferred tax assets, we will have to revise downwards or upwards the amount of the deferred tax assets, which could have a significant impact on our financial results.\nThis determination requires many estimates and judgments by our management for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax\nobligations and effective tax rate\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S.\nincome tax law, effective in 2018. Due to the absence of any guidance and the complexity of the new provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of its effects. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other standard-setting bodies shall issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that differ from our interpretation. As a consequence, further to the issuance of any final guidance, we may have to perform adjustments accordingly that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets are accounted for at acquisition cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment loss. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to nine years on a straight-line method. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances such as, but not limited to, significant declines in revenue, earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the financial and economic environment indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired.\nGoodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as a single reporting unit and has selected December 31 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the impairment assessment of its goodwill, the Company performs a two-step impairment test, which involves assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment for these assets.\nThe first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds its fair value, then the Company would perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The impairment loss to be recognized would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the Company to its net book value. In calculating the implied fair value of the Company's goodwill, the fair value of the Company would be allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities based on their fair values. The excess of the fair value of the Company over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.\nThere has been no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, as the Company's reporting unit's fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value based on the annual goodwill impairment test.\nInternal-Use Software\nCosts related to customized internal-use software that have reached the application development stage are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and stops when the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose. In making this determination, several analyses for each phase are performed, including analysis of the feasibility, availability of resources, intention to use and future economic benefits. Amortization of these costs begins when capitalization stops and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the assets' useful lives estimated at three to five years. Costs incurred during the preliminary development stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred.\nEquity Awards Compensation\nWe account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, share-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. The determination of the grant date fair value of RSUs is based on the share price on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of share options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated ordinary share fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables.\nThese variables include the fair value of our ordinary shares, the exercise price of the option, the expected term of the options, our expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fair value of our ordinary shares. Following our initial public offering, we established a policy of using the closing sales price per ADS as quoted on the Nasdaq on the date of grant for purposes of determining the fair value of ordinary shares.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Exercise price of the option. Following our initial public offering, we established a policy of using the closing sales price per ADS as quoted on the Nasdaq on the date of grant for purposes of determining the exercise price with a floor value of 95% of the average of the closing sales price per ADS for the 20 trading days preceding the grant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the ordinary share option awards granted, we have based our expected term on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the award.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected volatility. Prior to our initial public offering, as we did not have a trading history for our ordinary shares, the expected share price volatility for our ordinary shares was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the ordinary share option grants. From the initial public offering, the expected share price volatility takes into account the Criteo closing share price from the initial public offering date to the grant date and closing share price of industry peers for the remaining expected term of the ordinary share option grant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Risk-free rate.

computed by applying the average exchange rates for the prior year to the following year figures.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nRevenue for 2018 increased $3.6 million, or 0.2% (or decreased (1)% on a constant currency basis) to $2,300.3 million, compared to 2017. Revenue was impacted by the discontinuation of certain products over the period. Revenue from new clients contributed 63% to the year-over-year revenue growth of the period, while revenue from existing clients contributed 37%. Business with our existing clients was generally resilient despite significant headwinds resulting in softer contribution to revenue growth. We added 1,301 net new clients across regions and client sizes over the period, a lower volume than the prior year, primarily driven by delayed sales headcount hiring and increased employee attrition, particularly in the midmarket.\nOffsetting this, clients increasingly used our Criteo Marketing Solutions to address new marketing goals, particularly Consideration, as well as Criteo Retail Media solutions, launched campaigns in new environments, such as apps, and benefited from our broader direct connections with publishers through Criteo Direct Bidder.\nOur revenue in the Americas region decreased (4)% (or (3)% on a constant currency basis) to $954.1 million for 2018 compared to 2017. While we saw continued strength with our largest existing clients in the United States, execution was more difficult in the midmarket across the region and we experienced prolonged difficult market conditions in Latin America.\nWe saw a positive impact from the continued ramp up of our expanded Criteo Marketing Solutions and Criteo Retail Media solutions, in particular in the United States. Contribution from existing clients was negatively impacted by user coverage limitations across the region, and the discontinuation of certain products over the period. Contribution from new clients was negatively impacted by hiring delays within our sales teams.\nOur revenue in the EMEA region increased 4% (or 1% on a constant currency basis) to $839.8 million for 2018 compared to 2017. This was largely driven by solid growth in Germany, Russia and Middle-East, as well as the traction from our broader solutions offering. External negative factors, including the implementation of the GDPR, as well as some short-term disturbance related to the implementation of our new go-to-market model across the region had a temporary negative impact on revenue growth.\nOur revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 2% (or 1% on a constant currency basis) to $506.4 million for 2018 compared to 2017. Overall, revenue growth was driven by a stronger business in Korea (particularly in apps) and India and Japan (particularly with large clients).\nAdditionally, our $2,300.3 million of revenue for 2018 was positively impacted by $19.1 million of currency fluctuations, particularly as a result of the strengthening of the Japanese yen, the British pound and the euro partially offset by the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira, compared to the U.S. dollar.\nThe year-over-year decrease in revenue on a constant currency basis was attributable to a slight decrease in the average cost-per-click, not entirely offset by growth in the volume of clicks delivered on the advertisements displayed by us.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue for 2017 increased $497.5 million, or 28% (or 27% on a constant currency basis) to $2,296.7 million, compared to 2016. Revenue from net new clients contributed 29.3% to the global year-over-year revenue growth while revenue from existing clients contributed 70.7% to the global year-over-year revenue growth. This increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued technology innovation, a broader and improved access to quality publisher inventory, and the addition of clients across regions, client categories and products. Improved technology, better access to inventory through Criteo Direct Bidder, our proprietary header bidding technology, and the launch of new solutions within Criteo Marketing Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2017, helped generate more revenue per client, in particular from existing clients. Our ability to drive a large portion of our business from clients that have uncapped budgets continued to be a key driver in growing our revenue per existing client.\nThe year-over-year increase was the result of our rapid growth across all geographies.\nOur revenue in the Americas region increased 36% (or 35% on a constant currency basis) to $990.4 million for 2017 compared to 2016. This was driven by the acquisition of new large clients and our ability to increase their spend with us through the year, the continued increase in revenue from existing large clients, continued strong traction from midmarket clients across the region, and the increasing contribution of Criteo Retail Media, in particular in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOur revenue in the EMEA region increased 22% (or 21% on a constant currency basis) to $809.0 million for 2017 compared to 2016. This was driven by the addition of several new large and midmarket clients across markets in the region and the continued growth of our revenue from existing clients, in particular commerce clients, across large and midmarket clients and geographic markets. In 2017, we also significantly expanded the commercial presence of Criteo Retail Media in Europe, which contributed to the regional revenue growth.\nOur revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 22% (or 24% on a constant currency basis) to $497.3 million for 2017 compared to 2016. This was driven by the continued expansion of our business with existing large clients, in particular in Japan, the addition of new clients in the large client and midmarket categories across all Asian markets, and continued solid growth across South-East Asian markets, largely supported by continued growth in in-app inventory.\nAdditionally, our $2,296.7 million of revenue for 2017 was positively impacted by $4.8 million of currency fluctuations, particularly as a result of the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the British pound partially offset by the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the euro, compared to the U.S. dollar.\nOver 100% of the year-over-year growth in revenue on a constant currency basis was attributable to an increase in the volume of clicks delivered on the advertisements displayed by us.\nThe release of Apple's Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature in Apple's Safari browser, or ITP, on September 19, 2017 had a net negative impact on our Revenue ex-TAC in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 of less than $1.0 million and $25 million, respectively.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traffic acquisition costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,068,911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,355,556\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,334,334\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other cost of revenue\n</td> <td>(85,260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(121,641\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131,744\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,154,171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,477,197\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,466,078\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(64\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit %\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCost of revenue for 2018 decreased $(11.1) million, or (1)%, compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily the result of a $(21.2) million, or (2)% (or (2)% on a constant currency basis), decrease in traffic acquisition costs and a $10.1 million, or 8% (or 8% on a constant currency basis), increase in other cost of revenue.\nThe decrease in traffic acquisition costs related primarily to a (2.7)% decrease (or (3.2)% decrease on a constant currency basis) in the average CPM for inventory purchased, partly offset by an increase of 1.2% in the total number of impressions we purchased. The increase in the volume of purchased impressions reflects our expanding relationships with existing and new publisher partners to support the growth in our client demand for advertising campaigns. The year-over-year decrease in average CPM was driven by a combination of factors, including the effectiveness of our Criteo Direct Bidder, which allows to buy quality inventory directly from large publishers and remove intermediary fees in the process, as well as of the growing share of in-app inventory in our business, which inventory cost tends to be slightly lower than that in the web browser environment.\nThe increase in other cost of revenue includes a $13.1 million increase in allocated depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.1 million increase in other cost of sales partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in hosting costs.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCost of revenue for 2017 increased $323.0 million, or 28%, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily the result of a $286.6 million, or 27% (or 27% on a constant currency basis), increase in traffic acquisition costs and a $36.4 million, or 43% (or 44% on a constant currency basis), increase in other cost of revenue.\nThe increase in traffic acquisition costs related primarily to an increase of 29.1% in the total number of impressions we purchased, partly offset by a 1.8% decrease (or 1.9% decrease on a constant currency basis) in the average CPM for inventory purchased. The increase in the volume of purchased impressions reflects our expanding relationships with existing and new publisher partners to support the growth in our client demand for commerce marketing campaigns. The year-over-year decrease in average CPM was driven by a combination of factors, including the effectiveness of our Criteo Direct Bidder, which allows to buy quality inventory directly from large publishers and remove intermediary fees in the process, as well as of the growing share of in-app inventory in our business, which inventory cost tends to be lower than that in the web browser environment.\nThe increase in other cost of revenue includes a $15.9 million increase in hosting costs, a $15.8 million increase in allocated depreciation and amortization expense and a $4.7 million increase in other cost of sales.\nRevenue excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs\nWe consider Revenue ex-TAC as a key measure of our business activity. Our strategy focuses on maximizing our Revenue ex-TAC on an absolute basis over maximizing our near-term gross margin. We believe this focus builds sustainable long-term value for our business by fortifying a number of our competitive strengths, including access to advertising inventory, breadth and depth of data and continuous improvement of the Criteo AI Engine's performance, allowing it to deliver more relevant advertisements at scale. As part of this focus, we continue to invest in building relationships with direct publishers and pursue access to leading advertising exchanges.\nThe following table sets forth our revenue, traffic acquisition costs and Revenue ex-TAC by region, including the Americas (North and South America), Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia-Pacific: Table 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Region\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>954,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>660,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>808,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>839,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>407,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>497,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>506,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,799,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,296,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,300,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Traffic acquisition costs\n</td> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(451,774\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(619,393\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(579,597\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(373,664\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(450,297\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(471,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(243,473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(285,866\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(283,083\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,068,911\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,355,556\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,334,334\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue ex-TAC (1)\n</td> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>374,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asia-Pacific\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>941,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>965,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) We define Revenue ex-TAC as our revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs generated over the applicable measurement period. Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue ex-TAC by Region are not measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue ex-TAC by Region in this Form 10-K because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance and generate future operating plans. In particular, we believe that the elimination of TAC from revenue and review of these measures by region can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue ex-TAC by Region provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue ex-TAC by Region has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may address the impact of TAC differently; (b) other companies may report Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue ex-TAC by Region or similarly titled measures but define the regions differently, which reduces their effectiveness as a comparative measure; and (c) other companies may report Revenue ex-TAC or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue ex-TAC by Region alongside our other U.S. GAAP financial results, including revenue. The above table provides a reconciliation of Revenue ex-TAC by region to revenue by region. Please also refer to footnote 3 to the \"Other Financial and Operating Data\" table in Item 6.

The $5.1 million financial expense for the period ended December 31, 2018 was mainly driven by the non-utilization costs and upfront fees amortization incurred as part of our available revolving credit facility RCF financing. The hedging costs related to the intra-group position between Criteo S.A. and its U.S subsidiary in the context of the funding of the HookLogic acquisition was lower in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period ended in 2017 as this intra-group position no longer requires hedging following the qualification as a net investment in a foreign operation in February 2018. At December 31, 2018, our exposure to foreign currency risk was centralized at Criteo S.A. and hedged using foreign currency swaps or forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nFinancial expense for 2017 increased by $9.0 million compared to 2016. The $9.5 million financial expense for the period ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the interest incurred as a result of the $75.0 million drawn on the revolving credit facility entered into in September 2015 (as amended in March 2017) and the hedging cost related to an intra-group position between Criteo S.A. and its U.S. subsidiary, both in the context of the funding of the HookLogic acquisition in November 2016, as well as the non-utilization fees incurred as part of our available RCF financing.

The annual effective tax rate for 2018 was 32.5%, compared to an annual effective tax rate of 24.7% for 2017. Generally, the annual effective tax rates differ from statutory rates primarily due to the impact of the domestic tax deduction applicable to technology royalty income we received from our subsidiaries, differences in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax loss carryforwards in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, non-recognition of deferred tax assets related to tax losses and temporary differences, recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses and equity awards compensation expense.\nIn 2018, our income before taxes increased by $13.7 million to $142.0 million, compared to 2017, generating a $48.9 million theoretical income tax expense at a nominal standard French tax rate of 34.43%. This theoretical tax expense is impacted primarily by the following items contributing to a $46.1 million effective tax expense and a 32.5% effective tax rate: $17.7 million of net effect of share-based compensation, $11.7 million of deferred tax assets on which we recognized a valuation allowance (mainly related to Criteo Ltd, Criteo Corp., Criteo Pty and Criteo do Brasil LTDA), $12.0 million of permanent differences (mainly based on employee costs, depreciation expenses and intercompany transactions), $3.8 million related to the French business tax Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajout\u00e9e des Entreprises, or CVAE\u201d, offset by a $38.6 million tax deduction resulting from technology royalty income we received from our subsidiaries, $10.2 million Research and Development tax credit and the recognition or reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for $4.5 million (mainly for Criteo Advertising (Beijing) Co. Ltd) and $1.8 million relating to other tax adjustments. Please see Note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the provision for income taxes.\nAmounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements are calculated at the level of each subsidiary within our consolidated financial statements. As at December 31, 2018, the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets amounted to $43.2 million. It mainly related to Criteo Corp.

The annual effective tax rate for 2017 was 24.7%, compared to an annual effective tax rate of 27.5% for 2016. Generally, the annual effective tax rates differ from statutory rates primarily due to the impact of the domestic tax deduction applicable to technology royalty income we received from our subsidiaries, differences in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax loss carryforwards in certain of our foreign subsidiaries and equity awards compensation expense.\nIn 2017, our income before taxes increased by $7.9 million to $128.3 million, compared to 2016, generating a $44.2 million theoretical income tax expense at a nominal standard French tax rate of 34.43%.

currency of the Company is the euro, while our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Consequently, as a first step, since we incur portions of our expenses and derive revenues in currencies other than the euro, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange risk exposure also arises from intra-company transactions and financing with subsidiaries that have a functional currency different than the euro. The statements of financial position of consolidated entities having a functional currency different from the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the closing exchange rate (spot exchange rate at the statement of financial position date) and the statement of income, statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flow of such consolidated entities are translated at the average period to date exchange rate. The resulting translation adjustments are included in equity under the caption Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.\nThe $0.5 million financial expense for the period ended December 31, 2016 resulted from the interest incurred as a result of drawing on the General RCF to partially fund the acquisition of HookLogic in November 2016, the negative impact of foreign exchange reevaluations and related hedging mainly recorded during the first quarter, partially offset by the foreign exchange gain realized on the hedging of the HookLogic acquisition.\nThe $9.5 million financial expense for the period ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the interest incurred as a result of the $75.0 million drawn on the RCF entered into in September 2015 (as amended in March 2017) and the hedging cost related to an intra-group position between Criteo S.A. and its U.S. subsidiary, both in the context of the funding of the HookLogic acquisition in November 2016, as well as the non-utilization fees incurred as part of our available RCF financing.\nThe $5.1 million financial expense for the period ended December 31, 2018 was mainly driven by the non-utilization costs and upfront fees amortization incurred as part of our available RCF financing. The intra-group position between Criteo S.A. and its U.S subsidiary in the context of the funding of the HookLogic acquisition is qualified as a net investment in a foreign operation from February 2018 and no longer requires hedging, resulting in reduced costs compared to the same period ended December 31, 2017.\nSince 2013, the Company has had a foreign currency risk management policy in place. At December 31, 2018, our exposure to foreign currency risk was centralized at Criteo S.A. and hedged using foreign currency swaps or forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies.\nForeign

Since 2012, we utilize a cash pooling arrangement, reinforcing cash management centralization. Investment and financing decisions are carried out by our internal central treasury function. We only deal with counterparties with high credit ratings. In addition, under our Investment and Risk Management Policy, our central treasury function ensures a balanced distribution between counterparties of the investments, no matter the rating of such counterparty.\nLiquidity Risk\nWe are mainly exposed to changes of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWorking Capital\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operations, trade receivables, net of allowances and working capital for the periods indicated:\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$245,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$260,726\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade receivables, net of allowances\n</td> <td>$484,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$473,901\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital (current assets less current liabilities)\n</td> <td>$370,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$328,507\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the cash flows were also negatively impacted by a $21.0 million change in foreign exchange rates on our cash position over the period. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur policy is to invest any cash in excess of our immediate requirements in investments designed to preserve the principal balance and provide liquidity. Accordingly, our cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts and money market funds that are currently providing only a minimal return.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations. Since our inception, we raised a total of $51.1 million aggregate net proceeds from the sale of preferred shares through four private placements. In November 2013, we received aggregate net proceeds before expenses of $269.0 million from our initial public offering. In March 2014, we received aggregate net proceeds before expenses of $22.6 million from our secondary equity offering. We also benefited to a much lesser extent from the proceeds of the exercise of share options and warrants and expect to continue to do so in the future, as such securities are exercised by holders.\nWe are party to a loan agreement and several RCFs with third-party financial institutions. Our loan and RCF agreements as of December 31, 2018 are presented in the table below:\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Nominal/ Authorized amounts\n(RCF Only)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount drawn as of December 31, 2018 (RCF only)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount Oustanding as of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nature\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Settlement date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BPI Loan - February 2014\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed: 2.09%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other BPI Loans\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023 and after\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Loans\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank Syndicate RCF - September 2015\n</td> <td>\u20ac\n</td> <td>350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u20ac\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u20ac\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Floating rate: EURIBOR / LIBOR + margin depending on leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 2022\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information regarding our loan and RCF agreements, please refer to Note 13 - Financial Liabilities and Note 23 - Commitments and contingencies.\nAll of these loans and RCFs are unsecured and contain customary events of default but do not contain any affirmative, financial or negative covenants, with the exception of the September 2015 RCF which contains covenants, including compliance with a total net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio and restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the required leverage ratio.\nWe are also party to short-term credit lines and overdraft facilities with HSBC Holdings plc, LCL and BNP Paribas. We are authorized to draw up to a maximum of \u20ac21.5 million ($24.6 million) in the aggregate under the short-term credit lines and overdraft facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had not drawn on either of these facilities. Any loans or overdrafts under these short-term facilities bear interest based on the one month EURIBOR rate or three month EURIBOR rate. As these facilities are exclusively short-term credit and overdraft facilities, our banks have the ability to terminate such facilities on short notice.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nIn 2016, 2017 and 2018, our actual capital expenditures were $77.4 million, $108.5 million and $125.5 million, respectively, primarily related to the acquisition of data center and server equipment, fit out of new offices and internal IT systems. We expect our capital expenditures to remain at the level of approximately 5% of revenue for 2019, as we plan to continue to build and maintain additional data center equipment capacity in all regions and significantly increase our redundancy capacity to strengthen our infrastructure.\nAs part of our strategy to build upon our market and technology leadership, in 2016 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of HookLogic for a final purchase price of $249.0 million financed by (i) a $75.0 million amount drawn on the General RCF and (ii) a $175.1 million amount financed by the available cash resources and in 2018 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Storetail and Manage for $43.7 million and $60.0 million respectively, financed by the available cash resources.\nWe believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months.\nOur future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our revenue growth, the amount and timing of our investments in personnel and capital equipment, and the timing and extent of our introduction of new products and product enhancements.\nIf our cash and cash equivalents balances and cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings to support our operations, and such financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We may also need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses, technologies, assets or products.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing will be dilutive to our shareholders.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for 2016, 2017 and 2018:\nTable 259: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(312,763\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106,253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(226,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash from financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,468\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62,676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 were held for working capital and general corporate purposes, which could include acquisitions. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared with December 31, 2017, primarily resulted from $260.7 million in cash flows from operating activities offset by $(226.7) million in cash flows used for investing activities and $(62.7) million used for financing activities.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities are primarily driven by the increase in the number of clients using our solution, the increase in spending from our existing clients and investment in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business. Cash flows provided by operating activities have typically been generated from net income and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating expense items such as depreciation, amortization, equity awards compensation, deferred tax assets and income taxes paid.\nIn 2018, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $260.7 million and consisted of net income of $95.9 million and $221.5 million in adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items, by $10.4 million of cash flows from working capital and partially offset by $67.0 million of income taxes paid during 2018. Adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $111.8 million, equity awards compensation expense of $66.6 million, accrued income taxes of $54.3 million, partially offset by $0.9 million net loss on disposal of non-current assets, $8.2 million of changes in deferred tax assets and by $2.3 million reclassification of the cash impact of the settlement of hedging derivatives to financing activities. The $10.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of $1.4 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $4.0 million decrease in other current assets (including prepaid expenses and VAT receivables) and a $9.0 million increase in accounts payable partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in accrued expenses such as payroll and payroll related expenses and VAT payables.\nIn 2017, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $245.5 million and consisted of net income of $96.7 million and $212.3 million in adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items partially offset by $7.1 million of cash flows used for working capital and $56.4 million of income taxes paid during 2017. Adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $104.0 million, equity awards compensation expense of $71.6 million, accrued income taxes of $44.9 million, a net gain on disposal of non-current assets of $0.8 million, reclassification of the cash impact of the settlement of hedging derivatives to financing activities of $4.1 million, partially offset by $13.3 million of changes in deferred tax assets.\nThe $7.1 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of $76.9 million increase in accounts receivable and $3.4 million increase in other current assets (including prepaid expenses and VAT receivables) driven by increased revenue during the year and, to a lesser extent, an increase in office rental advance payments. This was partially offset by an $32.9 million increase in accounts payable and $40.3 million increase in accrued expenses such as payroll and payroll related expenses and VAT payables, explained primarily by an increase in traffic acquisition costs, and an increase in accrued payroll and payroll-related expenses resulting from an increase in the number of our employees.\nIn 2016 net cash flows provided by operating activities were $153.5 million and consisted of net income of $87.3 million and $139.1 million in adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items partially offset by $29.5 million of cash flows used by working capital and $43.5 million of income taxes paid during 2016. Adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $62.7 million, equity awards compensation expense of $43.3 million and $43.2 million of accrued income taxes, partially offset by $10.0 million of changes in deferred tax assets and $0.1 million of change in non-current assets. The $29.5 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of $118.0 million increase in\naccounts receivable and $28.4 million increase in other current assets (including prepaid expenses and VAT receivables) driven by increased revenue during the year and, to a lesser extent, an increase in office rental advance payments. This was partially offset by an $81.9 million increase in accounts payable and $35.1 million increase in accrued expenses such as payroll and payroll related expenses and VAT payables, explained primarily by an increase in traffic acquisition costs, and an increase in accrued payroll and payroll-related expenses resulting from an increase in the number of our employees.\nPrepaid expenses, VAT receivables, and other current assets also increased by $24.1 million, primarily as the result of an increase in our revenue and to a lesser extent, an increase in office rental advance payments.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities to date have consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment and acquisitions.\nIn 2018, net cash flows used in investing activities were $226.7 million and consisted of $125.5 million for purchases of property and equipment and by $101.2 million related to the Storetail and Manage acquisitions and disposal of a business.\nIn 2017, net cash flows used in investing activities were $106.3 million and consisted of $108.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $1.1 million related to change in acquisition price of HookLogic due to the working capital adjustment and $1.1 million of lease deposits refunds.\nIn 2016, net cash flows used in investing activities were $312.8 million and consisted of $77.4 million for purchases of property and equipment, $235.5 million related to the HookLogic and Monsieur Drive acquisitions and $0.2 million of bank deposits or lease deposits related to new premises.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $62.7 million resulting from $1.5 million from proceeds of share option exercises and $16.8 million of changes in other financial liabilities relating to the cash impact of the settlement of hedging derivatives, offset by $80.0 million relating to the share repurchase program and by $1.0 million for the repayment of borrowings.\nIn 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $29.5 million resulting from $3.7 million of the drawing on the China RCF, $32.0 million from proceeds of share option exercises and $24.6 million of changes in other financial liabilities relating to the cash impact of the settlement of hedging derivatives, offset by $89.7 million for the repayment of drawings on the General RCF used in the context of the acquisition of HookLogic in 2016 and on the China RCF.\nIn 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $90.6 million resulting from $84.0 million of new loans (drawings on the General RCF to partially fund the consideration paid to acquire all of the outstanding shares of HookLogic and the China RCF) and $20.1 million from proceeds of share option exercises, partially offset by $13.3 million for repayment of indebtedness and $0.2 million of changes in other financial liabilities.\nTable 260: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>C.\n</td> <td>Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our solution and technology infrastructure, develop new features, conduct quality assurance testing and improve our core technology.

The following table summarizes our key metrics for 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nTable 262: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except number of clients)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of clients\n</td> <td>14,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue ex-TAC\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>941,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>965,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNumber of Clients\nWe define a client to be a unique party from whom we have received an insertion order and delivered an advertisement during the previous 12 months. We believe this criteria best identifies clients who are actively using our solution. We count specific brands or divisions within the same business as distinct clients so long as those entities have separately signed insertion orders with us. In the case of some solutions within Criteo Retail Media, we count the parent company of the brands as an individual client, even if several distinct brands pertaining to the same parent company have signed separate insertion orders with us. On the other hand, we count a client who runs campaigns in multiple geographies as a single client, even though multiple insertion orders may be involved. When the insertion order is with an advertising agency, we generally consider the client on whose behalf the advertising campaign is conducted as the client\u201d for purposes of this calculation. In the event a client has its advertising spend with us managed by multiple agencies, that client is counted as a single client.\nWe believe that our ability to increase the number of clients is an important indicator of our ability to grow revenue over time. While our client count has increased over time, this metric can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal trends in advertising spend of clients and the timing and amount of revenue contribution from new clients. In addition, over time we have added an increasing number of midmarket clients that generate a lower revenue per client than large clients on average, and may continue to add a significant number of midmarket clients in the future. Therefore, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between a change in clients in a particular period and an increase or decrease in our revenue.\nRevenue ex-TAC\nWe consider Revenue ex-TAC as a key measure of our business activity. Our traffic acquisition costs primarily consist of purchases of impressions from publishers on a CPM basis.\nOur management views our Revenue ex-TAC as a key measure to evaluate, plan and make decisions on our business activities and sales performance. In particular, we believe that the elimination of TAC from revenue can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Revenue ex-TAC provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Revenue ex-TAC is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Please see footnote 3 to the \"Other Financial and Operating Data\" table in \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the limitations of Revenue ex-TAC and a reconciliation of Revenue ex-TAC to revenue, the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our consolidated earnings before financial income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs and acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the elimination of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs and acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business.\nAccordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Please see footnote 5 to the \"Other Financial and Operating Data\" table in \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nHighlights and Trends\nRevenue\nWe believe the expansion of our business with existing clients as well as the addition of new clients have both been significant drivers of our historical growth. As a result, we believe significant opportunities exist for us to continue to grow our business going forward. Specifically, we believe that continued investments in technology innovation and data, the continued development of Criteo Shopper Graph, the development of new solutions addressing broader marketing goals and monetization objectives, a broader supply of quality inventory across publishers, the expansion of our client base across commerce and brands verticals, the addition of new clients across categories, in particular in the midmarket, and a higher penetration of existing geographic markets, will fuel our future growth. However, because of external factors and other factors, we may not be able to maintain our historical growth rates.\nRevenue ex-TAC\nWe are focused on maximizing our Revenue ex-TAC on an absolute basis. We believe this focus builds sustainable long-term value for our business by fortifying a number of our competitive strengths, including access to Display Advertising inventory, breadth and depth of data and continuous improvement of the Criteo AI Engine's performance, allowing us to deliver more relevant advertisements at scale. As part of this focus we are continuing to invest in building relationships with direct publishers, including with ecommerce retailers, and increasing access to leading advertising exchanges, which includes purchasing advertising inventory that may have lower margins on an individual impression basis, but generates incremental Revenue ex-TAC. We believe this strategy maximizes the growth of our Revenue ex-TAC on an absolute basis and strengthens our market position. As a result, we expect our traffic acquisition costs to continue to increase on an absolute basis as we continue to grow our revenue. However, our traffic acquisition costs might also increase as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in building liquidity and long-term value for clients and publishers over optimizing near-term gross margins, and as we grow our new solutions, some of which might involve a higher level of traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue relative to our historical trends.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 was $321.1 million, a 4% increase over 2017. Our increase in Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of the 3% growth in Revenue ex-TAC over the period. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was achieved despite continued investments in 2018, in particular in hosting costs, research and development expenses and sales and operations expenses, and more selective investments in general and administrative expenses, as we continued to scale our infrastructure and organization, and automate our processes to support future growth. In the short-term, we expect to continue to invest, in particular in research and development and sales resources, and to continue to increase the productivity of our existing resources and the automation of our internal processes, in particular in sales. As a result of these increased investments, we anticipate a temporary decrease in our Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2019. Over time, we expect Adjusted EBITDA to increase as a percentage of our Revenue ex-TAC, as we benefit from a larger scale and operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Please see footnote 5 to the \"Other Financial and Operating Data\" table in \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nNumber of Clients\nSince our inception, we have significantly grown the number of clients with which we do business. Our base of clients increased to more than 19,000 at December 31, 2018, a 7% increase over December 31, 2017. This growth in our number of clients has been driven by a number of factors, including our global footprint and our commercial expansion in existing markets, our continued development of large clients in the retail, travel and classifieds industry verticals, our expansion of midmarket clients and our penetration into the consumer brand vertical through some of our Criteo Retail Media offerings. We believe that our ability to increase our number of clients is a leading indicator of our ability to grow revenue over time. We expect to continue to focus our attention and investment on further growing our client base across all regions, client categories and verticals, including through the roll-out of our self-service sales platform for the midmarket in 2019. While we intend to grow our client base across all categories, we expect midmarket customers to continue to increase their contribution in the mix of our total revenue.\nClient Retention\nWe believe our ability to retain and grow revenue from our existing clients is a useful indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our client relationships. Our technology is designed to enable clients to efficiently and effectively engage and convert consumers through highly targeted and personalized commerce marketing across devices and environments. We measure our client satisfaction through our ability to retain them and the revenue they generate quarter after quarter. We define client retention rate as the percentage of live clients during the previous quarter that continued to be live clients during the current quarter. This metric is calculated on a quarterly basis, and for annual periods, we use an average of the quarterly metrics. We define a live client as a client whose advertising campaign has or had been generating Revenue ex-TAC for us on any day over the relevant measurement period. In each of 2016, 2017 and 2018, our client retention rate was approximately 90%1. We define our revenue retention rate with respect to a given 12-month period as (1) revenue recognized during such period from clients that contributed to revenue recognized in the prior 12-month period divided by (2) total revenue recognized in such prior 12-month period. Our revenue retention rate was 120%, 115% and 101% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively1.\nSeasonality\nOur client base consists primarily of businesses in the digital retail, travel and classifieds industries, which we define as commerce clients. In the digital retail industry in particular, many businesses devote the largest portion of their advertising spend to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday spending by consumers. With respect to Criteo Retail Media, the concentration of advertising spend in the fourth quarter of the calendar year is particularly pronounced. Our retail commerce clients typically conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the first and second quarters than they do in other quarters, while our travel clients typically increase their travel campaigns in the first and third quarters and conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the second quarter. As a result, our revenue tends to be seasonal in nature, but the impact of this seasonality has, to date, been partly offset by our significant growth and geographic expansion. If the seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period.\n___________________________________________________\n1 Excluding Criteo Retail Media.\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>E.\n</td> <td>Off-balance Sheet Arrangements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global technology company building the leading Advertising Platform for the Open Internet. We strive to deliver impactful business results at scale to commerce companies and consumer brands by meeting their multiple marketing goals at their targeted return on investment. Using shopping data, predictive technology and large consumer reach, we help our clients drive Awareness, Consideration and Conversion for their products and services1, and help retailers generate advertising revenues from consumer brands. Our data is pooled among our clients and offers deep insights into consumer intent and purchasing habits. To drive measurable results for clients, we activate our data assets through proprietary AI technology to engage consumers in real time through the pricing and delivery of highly relevant digital advertisements, across devices and environments. By pricing our offering on a range of pricing models and measuring our value based on clear, well-defined performance metrics, we make the return on investment transparent and easy to measure for advertisers.\nOur clients include some of the largest and most sophisticated commerce companies in the world, along with world-class consumer brands. We partner with them to capture user activity on their websites and mobile applications (\"apps\"), which we define as digital properties, and optimize the performance of their ads based on that activity and other data. Demonstrating the depth and scale of our data, we collected data on over $800 billion in online sales transactions2 on our clients' digital properties in the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on this data and other assets, we delivered targeted ads that generated over 10 billion clicks2 in the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we served more than 19,000 clients and, in each of the last three years, our average client retention rate, as measured on a quarterly basis, was approximately 90%2. We serve a wide range of clients and our revenue is not concentrated within any single client or group of clients. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, our largest client represented 2.0%, 1.9% and 2.0% of our revenue, respectively, and in 2018, our largest 10 clients represented 11.7% of our revenue in the aggregate. There is no group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other constituting an aggregate amount equal to 10% or more of our consolidated revenues, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Advertising Platform for the Open Internet is currently comprised of two families of solutions: Criteo Marketing Solutions and Criteo Retail Media. All products leverage the same technology in the Criteo AI Engine.\nWe operate in 98 countries through a network of 31 offices located in Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA), the Americas and Asia-Pacific. As a result of our significant international operations, our revenue from outside of France, our home country, accounted for 93.3% of our revenue for year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's foreign currency risk exposure to the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real and the U.S dollar against the euro (the euro still remains the Group's functional currency) is described in Item 7 note B. Liquidity and Capital Resources to our Management's Discussion and Analysis included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n___________________________________________________\n1 Driving Awareness for a brand means exposing its brand name to consumers who have not been in touch with the brand before, thereby creating brand awareness from such consumers. Driving Consideration for an advertiser's products or services means attracting prospective new consumers to consider engaging with and/or buying this advertiser's products or services. Driving Conversion for an advertisers' products or services means triggering a purchase by consumers who have already engaged with this advertisers products or services in the past.\n2 Excluding Criteo Retail Media\nOur financial results include:\n \u2022 Revenue of $1,799.1 million, $2,296.7 million and 2,300.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively; \n \u2022 Revenue ex-TAC, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $730.2 million, $941.1 million and $966.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively; \n \u2022 Net Income of $87.3 million, $96.7 million and $95.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively; and \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $224.6 million, $309.6 million and $321.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. \nPlease see footnotes 3, 4 and 5 to the Other Financial and Operating Data table in Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d in this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of Revenue to Revenue ex-TAC, Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income to Adjusted Net Income respectively, in each case the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or \"U.S. GAAP\".\nWe are focused on maximizing Revenue ex-TAC. We believe this focus builds sustainable long-term value for our business and fortifies a number of our competitive strengths, including a highly liquid marketplace for Display Advertising. As part of this focus, we seek to maximize our percentage of overall marketing spend in the Display Advertising market over the long-term. In addition, this focus enriches liquidity for both advertisers and publishers resulting in more effective advertising for clients, better monetization for publishers and more relevant advertisements for consumers. We believe our results of operations reflect this focus.\nAcquisitions\nOn October 29, 2018, we acquired Manage, a Silicon Valley-based company with an attractive app install advertising solution.\nOn August 3, 2018, we acquired Storetail, a Paris-based pioneering retail media technology platform enabling retailers to monetize native placements on their ecommerce sites.\nOn November 9, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Hooklogic, a New York-based company connecting many of the world's largest ecommerce retailers with consumer brands. We now offer HookLogic's products under the \"Criteo Sponsored Products\" name.\nOn May 31, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Monsieur Drive, a Paris-based company building advertising products for the consumer packaged goods vertical.\nTransition to U.S. GAAP and Change in Reporting Currency\nAs of June 30, 2015, we no longer met the requirements to qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act. As a result, we began reporting as a domestic registrant as of January 1, 2016 and we are required under current SEC rules to prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, rather than IFRS, and to present our financial information in U.S. dollars instead of euros. The transition from consolidated financial statements under IFRS to U.S. GAAP only impacted the presentation of our consolidated statement of financial position (order of liquidity) and of our consolidated statement of cash flows (effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents). The functional currency of the Company remains the euro, while our reporting currency changed from the euro to the U.S. dollar. Consequently, since we incur portions of our expenses and derive revenues in currencies other than the euro, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange risk exposure also arises from intra-company transactions and financing with subsidiaries that have a functional currency different than the euro.\n A. Operating Results.  Basis of Presentation\nThe key elements of our results of operations include:\nRevenue\nWe sell personalized display advertisements featuring product-level recommendations either directly to clients or to advertising agencies. Historically, the Criteo model has focused solely on converting our clients' website visitors into customers, enabling us to charge our clients only when users engage with an ad we deliver, usually by clicking on it. More recently, we have expanded our solutions to address a broader range of marketing goals for our clients.\nWe offer two families of solutions to our commerce and brand clients:\n \u2022 Criteo Marketing Solutions allow commerce companies to address multiple marketing goals by engaging their consumers with personalized ads across the web, mobile and offline store environments. \n \u2022 Criteo Retail Media solutions allow retailers to generate advertising revenues from consumer brands, and/or to drive sales for themselves, by monetizing their data and audiences through personalized ads, either on their own digital property or on the open Internet, that address multiple marketing goals.  In conjunction with expanding our solutions, we have also started expanding our pricing models to now include a combination of cost-per-install and cost-per-impression for selected new solutions, in addition to cost-per-click.\nWe recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised services directly to our clients or to advertising agencies, which we collectively refer to as our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-click and cost-per-install basis, we bill our clients when a user clicks on an advertisement we deliver or installs an application by clicking on an advertisement we delivered, respectively. For these pricing models, we recognize revenue when a user clicks on an advertisement or installs an application.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-impression basis, we bill our clients based on the number of times an advertisement is displayed to an user. For this pricing model, we recognize revenue when an advertisement is displayed.\nWe act as principal in our arrangements because (i) we control the advertising inventory (spaces on websites) before it is transferred to our clients; (ii) we bear sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising promise and inventory risks and (iii) we have full discretion in establishing prices. Therefore, based on these factors, we report revenue earned and the related costs incurred on a gross basis.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue primarily includes traffic acquisition costs and other cost of revenue.\nTraffic Acquisition Costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist primarily of purchases of impressions from publishers on a CPM basis. We purchase impressions directly from publishers or third-party intermediaries, such as advertisement exchanges. We recognize cost of revenue on a publisher by publisher basis as incurred. Costs owed to publishers but not yet paid are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as trade payables.\nFor some solutions within Criteo Retail Media, we pay for the inventory of our retailer partners on a revenue sharing basis, effectively paying the retailers a portion of the click-based revenue generated by user clicks on the sponsored products advertisements displaying the products of our consumer brand clients.\nFor a discussion of the trends we expect to see in traffic acquisition costs, see the section entitled \" - Highlights and Trends - Revenue ex-TAC\" in Item 7.D - Trend Information below.\nOther Cost of Revenue. Other cost of revenue includes expenses related to third-party hosting fees, depreciation of data center equipment and the cost of data purchased from third parties. The Company does not build or operate its own data centers and none of its Research and Development employments are dedicated to revenue generating activities. As a result, we do not include the costs of such personnel in other cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and operations, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation, pension benefits and other personnel-related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories. We grew from 1,841 employees at January 1, 2016 to 2,744 employees at December 31, 2018, and we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees in order to support our anticipated revenue growth.\nWe include equity awards compensation expense in connection with grants of share options, warrants, and restricted share units (\"RSUs\") in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient's function (Research and development, Sales and operations, General and administrative).\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our employees working in the engine, platform, site reliability engineering, scalability, infrastructure, engineering program management, product, analytics and other teams, including salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation and other personnel related costs. Our research and development function was supplemented in January 2013 to include a dedicated product organization following the appointment of a Chief Product Officer. Also included are non-personnel costs such as subcontracting, consulting and professional fees to third-party development resources, allocated overhead and depreciation and amortization costs. These expenses are partially offset by the French research tax credit that is conditional upon the level of our expenditures in research and development.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the performance of our solution and improving the efficiency of the services we deliver to our clients and publisher partners. All development costs, principally headcount-related costs, are expensed as management determines that technological feasibility is reached, shortly before the release of the developed products or features. As a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products or features are not material and, accordingly, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs mainly relates to internally developed internal-use software and IT licenses.\nThe number of employees in research and development functions grew from 399 at January 1, 2016 to 675 at December 31, 2018. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but remain fairly constant as a percentage of our revenue. We believe our continued investment in research and development to be critical to maintaining and improving our technology within the Advertising Platform for the Open Internet, our quality of service and our competitive position.\nSales and Operations Expense. Sales and operations expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our employees working in our sales, account strategy, sales operations, publisher business development, analytics, marketing, technical solutions, creative services and other teams, including salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation, and other personnel-related costs. Additional expenses in this category include travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, marketing activities, provisions for doubtful accounts, subcontracting, consulting and professional fees paid to third parties, allocated overhead and depreciation and amortization costs. The number of employees in sales and operations functions grew from 1,124 at January 1, 2016 to 1,574 at December 31, 2018. In order to continue to grow our business, geographic footprint and brand awareness, we expect to continue to invest in our resources in sales and operations, in particular by increasing the number of sales and account strategy teams in low penetrated geographic markets and in our midmarket organization. As a result, we expect sales and operations expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we invest to acquire new clients, retain existing ones and grow revenue from existing clients, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we scale and automate our operational processes, and increase the productivity of our sales and operations teams.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation, pension benefits and other personnel-related costs for our administrative, legal, information technology, human resources, facilities and finance teams. Additional expenses included in this category include travel-related expenses, subcontracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance and other corporate expenses, along with allocated overhead and depreciation and amortization costs. The number of employees in general and administrative functions grew from 318 at January 1, 2016 to 495 at December 31, 2018. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our growth, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we scale and increase the productivity of our general and administrative teams.\nFinancial Income (Expense)\nFinancial income (expense) primarily consists of:\n \u2022 exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation into local currency of monetary balance sheet items labeled in euros (the Company's functional currency). We are exposed to changes in exchange rates primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Brazil. The U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real are our most significant foreign currency exchange risks. At December 31, 2018, our exposure to foreign currency risk was centralized at parent company level and hedged. These exchange differences in euro are then translated into U.S. dollars (the Company's reporting currency) according to the average euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. \n \u2022 interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our debt loan agreements and revolving credit facilities (\"RCFs\").  We monitor foreign currency exposure and look to mitigate exposures through normal business operations and hedging strategies.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to potential income taxes in France, the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. We recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities, notwithstanding our belief that our tax return positions are supportable.\nOur effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate applicable to us primarily due to valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, differences between domestic and foreign jurisdiction tax rates, Research Tax Credit offsets, which are non-taxable items, potential tax audit provision settlements, share-based compensation expenses that are non-deductible in some jurisdictions under certain circumstances, and transfer pricing adjustments. We license access to our technology to our subsidiaries and charge a royalty fee to these subsidiaries for such access. In France, we benefit from a reduced tax rate of 15% on a large portion of this technology royalty income.\nOn September 27, 2017, we received a draft notice of proposed adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") audit of Criteo Corp. for the year ended December 31, 2014, confirmed by the definitive notice dated February 8, 2018. If the IRS prevails in its position, it could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated maximum aggregate amount of $15.0 million, excluding relative fees, interest and penalties. We strongly disagree with the IRS's position as asserted in the draft notice of proposed adjustment and intend to contest it.\nNo uncertain tax positions were identified as of December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue, assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe estimates associated with revenue recognition, trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions, impact of tax reforms in the U.S., goodwill and intangible assets, internal-use software and equity awards compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. See Note 1. Principles and Accounting Methods to our audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page for a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised services directly to our clients or to advertising agencies, which we collectively refer to as our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-click and cost-per-install basis, we bill our clients when a user clicks on an advertisement we deliver or installs an application by clicking on an advertisement we delivered, respectively. For these pricing models, we recognize revenue when a user clicks on an advertisement or installs an application.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-impression basis, we bill our clients based on the number of times an advertisement is displayed to a user. For this pricing model, we recognize revenue when an advertisement is displayed.\nWe act as principal in our arrangements because (i) we control the advertising inventory (spaces on websites) before it is transferred to our clients; (ii) we bear sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising promise and inventory risks and (iii) we have full discretion in establishing prices. Therefore, based on these factors, we report revenue earned and the related costs incurred on a gross basis.\nTrade Receivables, Net of Allowances for Doubtful Accounts\nWe carry our accounts receivable at net realizable value. On a periodic basis, our management evaluates our accounts receivable and determines whether to provide an allowance or if any accounts should be written down and charged to expense as a bad debt. The evaluation is based on a past history of collections, current credit conditions, the length of time the trade receivable is past due and a past history of write downs. A trade receivable is considered past due if we have not received payments based on agreed-upon terms. A higher default rate than estimated or a deterioration in our major clients' creditworthiness could have an adverse impact on our future results. Allowances for doubtful accounts on trade receivables are recorded in Sales and Operations\u201d in our consolidated statements of income. We generally do not require any security or collateral to support our trade receivables. The amount of allowance for doubtful accounts charged to our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 was $9.9 million, $13.3 million and $17.7 million, respectively and represented 2.5%, 2.7% and 3.7% of our trade receivables, net of allowances, as of December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDeferred taxes are recorded on all temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and on tax losses, using the liability method. Differences are defined as temporary when they are expected to reverse within a foreseeable future. We may only recognize deferred tax assets if, based on the projected taxable incomes within the next three years, we determine that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and tax credits can be utilized. As a result, the measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits which are not expected to be realized. If future taxable profits are\nconsiderably different from those forecasted that support recording deferred tax assets, we will have to revise downwards or upwards the amount of the deferred tax assets, which could have a significant impact on our financial results.\nThis determination requires many estimates and judgments by our management for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax\nobligations and effective tax rate\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S.\nincome tax law, effective in 2018. Due to the absence of any guidance and the complexity of the new provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of its effects. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other standard-setting bodies shall issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that differ from our interpretation. As a consequence, further to the issuance of any final guidance, we may have to perform adjustments accordingly that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets are accounted for at acquisition cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment loss. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to nine years on a straight-line method. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances such as, but not limited to, significant declines in revenue, earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the financial and economic environment indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired.\nGoodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as a single reporting unit and has selected December 31 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the impairment assessment of its goodwill, the Company performs a two-step impairment test, which involves assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment for these assets.\nThe first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds its fair value, then the Company would perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The impairment loss to be recognized would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the Company to its net book value. In calculating the implied fair value of the Company's goodwill, the fair value of the Company would be allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities based on their fair values. The excess of the fair value of the Company over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.\nThere has been no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, as the Company's reporting unit's fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value based on the annual goodwill impairment test.\nInternal-Use Software\nCosts related to customized internal-use software that have reached the application development stage are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and stops when the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose. In making this determination, several analyses for each phase are performed, including analysis of the feasibility, availability of resources, intention to use and future economic benefits. Amortization of these costs begins when capitalization stops and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the assets' useful lives estimated at three to five years. Costs incurred during the preliminary development stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred.\nEquity Awards Compensation\nWe account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, share-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. The determination of the grant date fair value of RSUs is based on the share price on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of share options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated ordinary share fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables.\nThese variables include the fair value of our ordinary shares, the exercise price of the option, the expected term of the options, our expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\n \u2022 Fair value of our ordinary shares. Following our initial public offering, we established a policy of using the closing sales price per ADS as quoted on the Nasdaq on the date of grant for purposes of determining the fair value of ordinary shares. \n \u2022 Exercise price of the option. Following our initial public offering, we established a policy of using the closing sales price per ADS as quoted on the Nasdaq on the date of grant", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global technology company building the leading Advertising Platform for the Open Internet. We strive to deliver impactful business results at scale to commerce companies and consumer brands by meeting their multiple marketing goals at their targeted return on investment. Using shopping data, predictive technology and large consumer reach, we help our clients drive Awareness, Consideration and Conversion for their products and services1, and help retailers generate advertising revenues from consumer brands. Our data is pooled among our clients and offers deep insights into consumer intent and purchasing habits. To drive measurable results for clients, we activate our data assets through proprietary AI technology to engage consumers in real time through the pricing and delivery of highly relevant digital advertisements, across devices and environments. By pricing our offering on a range of pricing models and measuring our value based on clear, well-defined performance metrics, we make the return on investment transparent and easy to measure for advertisers.\nOur clients include some of the largest and most sophisticated commerce companies in the world, along with world-class consumer brands. We partner with them to capture user activity on their websites and mobile applications (\"apps\"), which we define as digital properties, and optimize the performance of their ads based on that activity and other data. Demonstrating the depth and scale of our data, we collected data on over $800 billion in online sales transactions2 on our clients' digital properties in the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on this data and other assets, we delivered targeted ads that generated over 10 billion clicks2 in the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we served more than 19,000 clients and, in each of the last three years, our average client retention rate, as measured on a quarterly basis, was approximately 90%2. We serve a wide range of clients and our revenue is not concentrated within any single client or group of clients. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, our largest client represented 2.0%, 1.9% and 2.0% of our revenue, respectively, and in 2018, our largest 10 clients represented 11.7% of our revenue in the aggregate. There is no group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other constituting an aggregate amount equal to 10% or more of our consolidated revenues, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Advertising Platform for the Open Internet is currently comprised of two families of solutions: Criteo Marketing Solutions and Criteo Retail Media. All products leverage the same technology in the Criteo AI Engine.\nWe operate in 98 countries through a network of 31 offices located in Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA), the Americas and Asia-Pacific. As a result of our significant international operations, our revenue from outside of France, our home country, accounted for 93.3% of our revenue for year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's foreign currency risk exposure to the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real and the U.S dollar against the euro (the euro still remains the Group's functional currency) is described in Item 7 note B. Liquidity and Capital Resources to our Management's Discussion and Analysis included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n___________________________________________________\n1 Driving Awareness for a brand means exposing its brand name to consumers who have not been in touch with the brand before, thereby creating brand awareness from such consumers. Driving Consideration for an advertiser's products or services means attracting prospective new consumers to consider engaging with and/or buying this advertiser's products or services. Driving Conversion for an advertisers' products or services means triggering a purchase by consumers who have already engaged with this advertisers products or services in the past.\n2 Excluding Criteo Retail Media\nOur financial results include:\n \u2022 Revenue of $1,799.1 million, $2,296.7 million and 2,300.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively; \n \u2022 Revenue ex-TAC, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $730.2 million, $941.1 million and $966.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively; \n \u2022 Net Income of $87.3 million, $96.7 million and $95.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively; and \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $224.6 million, $309.6 million and $321.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. \nPlease see footnotes 3, 4 and 5 to the Other Financial and Operating Data table in Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d in this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of Revenue to Revenue ex-TAC, Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income to Adjusted Net Income respectively, in each case the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or \"U.S. GAAP\".\nWe are focused on maximizing Revenue ex-TAC. We believe this focus builds sustainable long-term value for our business and fortifies a number of our competitive strengths, including a highly liquid marketplace for Display Advertising. As part of this focus, we seek to maximize our percentage of overall marketing spend in the Display Advertising market over the long-term. In addition, this focus enriches liquidity for both advertisers and publishers resulting in more effective advertising for clients, better monetization for publishers and more relevant advertisements for consumers. We believe our results of operations reflect this focus.\nAcquisitions\nOn October 29, 2018, we acquired Manage, a Silicon Valley-based company with an attractive app install advertising solution.\nOn August 3, 2018, we acquired Storetail, a Paris-based pioneering retail media technology platform enabling retailers to monetize native placements on their ecommerce sites.\nOn November 9, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Hooklogic, a New York-based company connecting many of the world's largest ecommerce retailers with consumer brands. We now offer HookLogic's products under the \"Criteo Sponsored Products\" name.\nOn May 31, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Monsieur Drive, a Paris-based company building advertising products for the consumer packaged goods vertical.\nTransition to U.S. GAAP and Change in Reporting Currency\nAs of June 30, 2015, we no longer met the requirements to qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act. As a result, we began reporting as a domestic registrant as of January 1, 2016 and we are required under current SEC rules to prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, rather than IFRS, and to present our financial information in U.S. dollars instead of euros. The transition from consolidated financial statements under IFRS to U.S. GAAP only impacted the presentation of our consolidated statement of financial position (order of liquidity) and of our consolidated statement of cash flows (effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents). The functional currency of the Company remains the euro, while our reporting currency changed from the euro to the U.S. dollar. Consequently, since we incur portions of our expenses and derive revenues in currencies other than the euro, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange risk exposure also arises from intra-company transactions and financing with subsidiaries that have a functional currency different than the euro.\n A. Operating Results.  Basis of Presentation\nThe key elements of our results of operations include:\nRevenue\nWe sell personalized display advertisements featuring product-level recommendations either directly to clients or to advertising agencies. Historically, the Criteo model has focused solely on converting our clients' website visitors into customers, enabling us to charge our clients only when users engage with an ad we deliver, usually by clicking on it. More recently, we have expanded our solutions to address a broader range of marketing goals for our clients.\nWe offer two families of solutions to our commerce and brand clients:\n \u2022 Criteo Marketing Solutions allow commerce companies to address multiple marketing goals by engaging their consumers with personalized ads across the web, mobile and offline store environments. \n \u2022 Criteo Retail Media solutions allow retailers to generate advertising revenues from consumer brands, and/or to drive sales for themselves, by monetizing their data and audiences through personalized ads, either on their own digital property or on the open Internet, that address multiple marketing goals.  In conjunction with expanding our solutions, we have also started expanding our pricing models to now include a combination of cost-per-install and cost-per-impression for selected new solutions, in addition to cost-per-click.\nWe recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised services directly to our clients or to advertising agencies, which we collectively refer to as our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-click and cost-per-install basis, we bill our clients when a user clicks on an advertisement we deliver or installs an application by clicking on an advertisement we delivered, respectively. For these pricing models, we recognize revenue when a user clicks on an advertisement or installs an application.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-impression basis, we bill our clients based on the number of times an advertisement is displayed to an user. For this pricing model, we recognize revenue when an advertisement is displayed.\nWe act as principal in our arrangements because (i) we control the advertising inventory (spaces on websites) before it is transferred to our clients; (ii) we bear sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising promise and inventory risks and (iii) we have full discretion in establishing prices. Therefore, based on these factors, we report revenue earned and the related costs incurred on a gross basis.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue primarily includes traffic acquisition costs and other cost of revenue.\nTraffic Acquisition Costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist primarily of purchases of impressions from publishers on a CPM basis. We purchase impressions directly from publishers or third-party intermediaries, such as advertisement exchanges. We recognize cost of revenue on a publisher by publisher basis as incurred. Costs owed to publishers but not yet paid are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as trade payables.\nFor some solutions within Criteo Retail Media, we pay for the inventory of our retailer partners on a revenue sharing basis, effectively paying the retailers a portion of the click-based revenue generated by user clicks on the sponsored products advertisements displaying the products of our consumer brand clients.\nFor a discussion of the trends we expect to see in traffic acquisition costs, see the section entitled \" - Highlights and Trends - Revenue ex-TAC\" in Item 7.D - Trend Information below.\nOther Cost of Revenue. Other cost of revenue includes expenses related to third-party hosting fees, depreciation of data center equipment and the cost of data purchased from third parties. The Company does not build or operate its own data centers and none of its Research and Development employments are dedicated to revenue generating activities. As a result, we do not include the costs of such personnel in other cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and operations, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation, pension benefits and other personnel-related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories. We grew from 1,841 employees at January 1, 2016 to 2,744 employees at December 31, 2018, and we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees in order to support our anticipated revenue growth.\nWe include equity awards compensation expense in connection with grants of share options, warrants, and restricted share units (\"RSUs\") in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient's function (Research and development, Sales and operations, General and administrative).\nResearch and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our employees working in the engine, platform, site reliability engineering, scalability, infrastructure, engineering program management, product, analytics and other teams, including salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation and other personnel related costs. Our research and development function was supplemented in January 2013 to include a dedicated product organization following the appointment of a Chief Product Officer. Also included are non-personnel costs such as subcontracting, consulting and professional fees to third-party development resources, allocated overhead and depreciation and amortization costs. These expenses are partially offset by the French research tax credit that is conditional upon the level of our expenditures in research and development.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the performance of our solution and improving the efficiency of the services we deliver to our clients and publisher partners. All development costs, principally headcount-related costs, are expensed as management determines that technological feasibility is reached, shortly before the release of the developed products or features. As a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products or features are not material and, accordingly, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs mainly relates to internally developed internal-use software and IT licenses.\nThe number of employees in research and development functions grew from 399 at January 1, 2016 to 675 at December 31, 2018. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but remain fairly constant as a percentage of our revenue. We believe our continued investment in research and development to be critical to maintaining and improving our technology within the Advertising Platform for the Open Internet, our quality of service and our competitive position.\nSales and Operations Expense. Sales and operations expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our employees working in our sales, account strategy, sales operations, publisher business development, analytics, marketing, technical solutions, creative services and other teams, including salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation, and other personnel-related costs. Additional expenses in this category include travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, marketing activities, provisions for doubtful accounts, subcontracting, consulting and professional fees paid to third parties, allocated overhead and depreciation and amortization costs. The number of employees in sales and operations functions grew from 1,124 at January 1, 2016 to 1,574 at December 31, 2018. In order to continue to grow our business, geographic footprint and brand awareness, we expect to continue to invest in our resources in sales and operations, in particular by increasing the number of sales and account strategy teams in low penetrated geographic markets and in our midmarket organization. As a result, we expect sales and operations expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we invest to acquire new clients, retain existing ones and grow revenue from existing clients, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we scale and automate our operational processes, and increase the productivity of our sales and operations teams.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, equity awards compensation, pension benefits and other personnel-related costs for our administrative, legal, information technology, human resources, facilities and finance teams. Additional expenses included in this category include travel-related expenses, subcontracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance and other corporate expenses, along with allocated overhead and depreciation and amortization costs. The number of employees in general and administrative functions grew from 318 at January 1, 2016 to 495 at December 31, 2018. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our growth, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we scale and increase the productivity of our general and administrative teams.\nFinancial Income (Expense)\nFinancial income (expense) primarily consists of:\n \u2022 exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation into local currency of monetary balance sheet items labeled in euros (the Company's functional currency). We are exposed to changes in exchange rates primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Brazil. The U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real are our most significant foreign currency exchange risks. At December 31, 2018, our exposure to foreign currency risk was centralized at parent company level and hedged. These exchange differences in euro are then translated into U.S. dollars (the Company's reporting currency) according to the average euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. \n \u2022 interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and interest incurred on outstanding borrowings under our debt loan agreements and revolving credit facilities (\"RCFs\").  We monitor foreign currency exposure and look to mitigate exposures through normal business operations and hedging strategies.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to potential income taxes in France, the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. We recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities, notwithstanding our belief that our tax return positions are supportable.\nOur effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate applicable to us primarily due to valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, differences between domestic and foreign jurisdiction tax rates, Research Tax Credit offsets, which are non-taxable items, potential tax audit provision settlements, share-based compensation expenses that are non-deductible in some jurisdictions under certain circumstances, and transfer pricing adjustments. We license access to our technology to our subsidiaries and charge a royalty fee to these subsidiaries for such access. In France, we benefit from a reduced tax rate of 15% on a large portion of this technology royalty income.\nOn September 27, 2017, we received a draft notice of proposed adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") audit of Criteo Corp. for the year ended December 31, 2014, confirmed by the definitive notice dated February 8, 2018. If the IRS prevails in its position, it could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated maximum aggregate amount of $15.0 million, excluding relative fees, interest and penalties. We strongly disagree with the IRS's position as asserted in the draft notice of proposed adjustment and intend to contest it.\nNo uncertain tax positions were identified as of December 31, 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue, assets, liabilities, costs and expenses. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe estimates associated with revenue recognition, trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions, impact of tax reforms in the U.S., goodwill and intangible assets, internal-use software and equity awards compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. See Note 1. Principles and Accounting Methods to our audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page for a description of our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised services directly to our clients or to advertising agencies, which we collectively refer to as our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-click and cost-per-install basis, we bill our clients when a user clicks on an advertisement we deliver or installs an application by clicking on an advertisement we delivered, respectively. For these pricing models, we recognize revenue when a user clicks on an advertisement or installs an application.\nFor campaigns priced on a cost-per-impression basis, we bill our clients based on the number of times an advertisement is displayed to a user. For this pricing model, we recognize revenue when an advertisement is displayed.\nWe act as principal in our arrangements because (i) we control the advertising inventory (spaces on websites) before it is transferred to our clients; (ii) we bear sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising promise and inventory risks and (iii) we have full discretion in establishing prices. Therefore, based on these factors, we report revenue earned and the related costs incurred on a gross basis.\nTrade Receivables, Net of Allowances for Doubtful Accounts\nWe carry our accounts receivable at net realizable value. On a periodic basis, our management evaluates our accounts receivable and determines whether to provide an allowance or if any accounts should be written down and charged to expense as a bad debt. The evaluation is based on a past history of collections, current credit conditions, the length of time the trade receivable is past due and a past history of write downs. A trade receivable is considered past due if we have not received payments based on agreed-upon terms. A higher default rate than estimated or a deterioration in our major clients' creditworthiness could have an adverse impact on our future results. Allowances for doubtful accounts on trade receivables are recorded in Sales and Operations\u201d in our consolidated statements of income. We generally do not require any security or collateral to support our trade receivables. The amount of allowance for doubtful accounts charged to our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 was $9.9 million, $13.3 million and $17.7 million, respectively and represented 2.5%, 2.7% and 3.7% of our trade receivables, net of allowances, as of December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDeferred taxes are recorded on all temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and on tax losses, using the liability method. Differences are defined as temporary when they are expected to reverse within a foreseeable future. We may only recognize deferred tax assets if, based on the projected taxable incomes within the next three years, we determine that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and tax credits can be utilized. As a result, the measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits which are not expected to be realized. If future taxable profits are\nconsiderably different from those forecasted that support recording deferred tax assets, we will have to revise downwards or upwards the amount of the deferred tax assets, which could have a significant impact on our financial results.\nThis determination requires many estimates and judgments by our management for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax\nobligations and effective tax rate\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S.\nincome tax law, effective in 2018. Due to the absence of any guidance and the complexity of the new provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of its effects. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other standard-setting bodies shall issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that differ from our interpretation. As a consequence, further to the issuance of any final guidance, we may have to perform adjustments accordingly that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets are accounted for at acquisition cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment loss. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to nine years on a straight-line method. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances such as, but not limited to, significant declines in revenue, earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the financial and economic environment indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired.\nGoodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as a single reporting unit and has selected December 31 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the impairment assessment of its goodwill, the Company performs a two-step impairment test, which involves assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment for these assets.\nThe first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds its fair value, then the Company would perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The impairment loss to be recognized would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the Company to its net book value. In calculating the implied fair value of the Company's goodwill, the fair value of the Company would be allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities based on their fair values. The excess of the fair value of the Company over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.\nThere has been no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, as the Company's reporting unit's fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value based on the annual goodwill impairment test.\nInternal-Use Software\nCosts related to customized internal-use software that have reached the application development stage are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and stops when the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose. In making this determination, several analyses for each phase are performed, including analysis of the feasibility, availability of resources, intention to use and future economic benefits. Amortization of these costs begins when capitalization stops and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the assets' useful lives estimated at three to five years. Costs incurred during the preliminary development stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred.\nEquity Awards Compensation\nWe account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, share-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. The determination of the grant date fair value of RSUs is based on the share price on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of share options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated ordinary share fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables.\nThese variables include the fair value of our ordinary shares, the exercise price of the option, the expected term of the options, our expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\n \u2022 Fair value of our ordinary shares. Following our initial public offering, we established a policy of using the closing sales price per ADS as quoted on the Nasdaq on the date of grant for purposes of determining the fair value of ordinary shares. \n \u2022 Exercise price of the option. Following our initial public offering, we established a policy of using the closing sales price per ADS as quoted on the Nasdaq on the date of grant"}
