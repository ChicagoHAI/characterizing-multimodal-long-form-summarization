Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and footnotes thereto incorporated by reference included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nThe Company is a leading multi-brand restaurant company that develops, markets and acquires fast-casual and premium-casual dining restaurant concepts around the world, including corporate-owned stores and franchises. As of December 31, 2021, we were the owner and franchisor of the two following brands:\nBurgerFi. BurgerFi is a fast-casual better burger\u201d concept, renowned for delivering an exceptional, all-natural premium better burger\u201d experience in a refined, contemporary environment. BurgerFi's chef-driven menu offerings and eco-friendly restaurant design drive our brand communication. It offers a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, frozen custard, hand-cut fries, shakes, beer, wine and more. Originally founded in 2011 in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida, the purpose was simple - RedeFining\u201d the way the world eats burgers by providing an upscale burger offering, at a fast-casual price point. BurgerFi is committed to an uncompromising and rewarding dining experience that promises fresh food of transparent quality. Since its inception, BurgerFi has grown to 118 BurgerFi locations, and as of December 31, 2021, was comprised of 25 corporate-owned restaurants and 93 franchised restaurants in 2 countries and 22 states, as well as Puerto Rico.\nBurgerFi was named Best Fast Casual Restaurant\u201d in USA Today's 10Best 2022 Readers Choice Awards for the second consecutive year, QSR Magazine's Breakout Brand of 2020, Fast Casual's 2021 #1 Brand of the Year and included in Inc. Magazine's Fastest Growing Private Companies List. In 2021, Consumer Report's Chain Reaction Report praised BurgerFi for serving no antibiotic beef\u201d across all its restaurants, and Consumer Reports awarded BurgerFi an \"A-Grade Angus Beef\" rating for the third consecutive year.\nAnthony's. Anthony's is a premium pizza and wing brand operating 61 corporate-owned casual restaurant locations, as of December 31, 2021. Anthony's prides itself on serving fresh, never frozen, high-quality ingredients. The concept is centered around a 900-degree coal fired oven, and its menu offers well-done\u201d pizza, coal fired chicken wings, homemade meatballs, and a variety of handcrafted sandwiches and salads. The restaurants also feature a deep wine and craft beer selection to round out the menu. The pizzas are prepared using a unique coal fired oven to quickly seal in natural flavors while creating a lightly charred crust. Anthony's provides a differentiated offering among its casual dining peers driven by its coal fired oven, which enables the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients with quicker ticket times.\nSince its inception in 2002, the Anthony's brand has grown to 61 corporate-owned locations, as of December 31, 2021, primarily along the East coast and has restaurants in eight states, including Florida (28), Pennsylvania (12), New Jersey (8), New York (5), Massachusetts (4), Delaware (2), Maryland (1), and Rhode Island (1).\nAnthony's was named The Best Pizza Chain in America\" by USA Today's Great American Bites and Top 3 Best Major Pizza Chain\u201d by Mashed in 2021.\nBeyond our current brand portfolio, we intend to acquire other restaurant concepts that will allow us to grow and also offer additional food categories. In evaluating potential acquisitions, we specifically seek concepts with, among others, the following characteristics:\n\u2022established, recognized brands;\n\u2022long-term, sustainable operating performance;\n\u2022consistent cash flows; and\n\u2022growth potential, both geographically and through co-branding initiatives across our portfolio.\nIntending to leverage our developing management platform, we expect to achieve cost synergies post-acquisition by reducing the corporate overhead of the acquired company. We also plan to grow the top line revenues of newly acquired brands through support from our management and systems platform, franchising, marketing and advertising, supply chain assistance, site selection analysis, staff training and operational oversight and support.\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn November 3, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Anthony's, which through its subsidiaries, owns and operates casual dining pizza restaurants under the trade name Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza & Wings. The results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Anthony's is included in our consolidated financial statements as of the closing date of the acquisition.\nSegments\nWe have two operating and reportable segments: (1) BurgerFi and (2) Anthony's. Our business generates revenue from the following sources: (i) restaurant sales, (ii) royalty and other fees, consisting primarily of royalties based on a percentage of sales reported by franchised restaurants and paid by franchisees, and (iii) franchise fees, consisting primarily of licensing fees paid by franchisees.\nSignificant Recent Developments Regarding COVID-19\nDuring March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly spreading outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus designated COVID-19. The pandemic has significantly impacted economic conditions in the United States, where all of our corporate-owned restaurants are located. While the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have partially subsided, its effects vary by region, and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to disrupt economic conditions and business activities, particularly as new outbreaks and variants of COVID-19 arise. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent and emerging variants, could affect our business, operations and financial results is uncertain as it will depend upon numerous evolving factors that management may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and the continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19. The acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, along with the length and extent of any continuing economic and market disruptions, are unknown, and therefore, any future impacts on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations cannot be quantified or predicted with specificity.\nWe believe that we have taken appropriate steps to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and our business model has, thus far, proven resilient. We continue to actively monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and to the extent that future business activities are adversely affected by the pandemic, we intend to take appropriate actions designed to mitigate these impacts. We continue to adapt to the changing operational and economic environment that has resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our top priority has been to take appropriate actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and business partners, and we continue to monitor evolving health guidelines and respond to changes as appropriate. Notwithstanding moderation of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental and other restrictions, we may continue to experience negative effects on our business and operations from possible longer-term changes in consumer and customer behavior and/or from negative economic conditions, including recent inflationary effects on labor and food costs, supply chain disruptions and availability of labor.\nWe did not experience any material supply chain disruptions as a result of COVID-19 during 2020 or 2021; however, there can be no assurance that we will not experience supply chain challenges in the future. We have implemented price increases to mitigate the inflationary effects of food and labor costs; however, we cannot predict the long-term impact of these negative economic conditions on our restaurant profitability. Although we have experienced some recovery since the initial impact of COVID-19 and are able to meet our obligations as they become due with our cash flow from operations, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the economy and on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted. In addition, despite a recent decline in cases, hospitalizations and deaths in large portions of the United States, mask mandates, social-distancing, travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders could be reinstated. We may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing, reducing capital spending, or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business. Refer to the matters discussed under the caption Risk Factors\u201d beginning on page 10.\nKey Metrics\nThe following key metrics are important indicators of the overall direction of our business, including trends in sales and the effectiveness of our marketing, operating, and growth initiatives for the BurgerFi brand:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except for percentage data) </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Systemwide Restaurant Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,866 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Systemwide Restaurant Sales Growth </td> <td>31% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Systemwide Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td>(12)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,977 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales Growth </td> <td>39% </td> <td> </td> <td>9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate-Owned Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td>(15)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Restaurant Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,860 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Restaurant Sales Growth </td> <td>30% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth </td> <td>15% </td> <td> </td> <td>(11)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital Channel Orders Growth </td> <td>18% </td> <td> </td> <td>93% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital Channel Orders </td> <td>2,482 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,193 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital Channel Orders % of Systemwide Sales </td> <td>39% </td> <td> </td> <td>43% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSystemwide Restaurant Sales\nSystemwide restaurant sales is presented as informational data in order to understand the aggregation of franchised stores sales, ghost kitchen and corporate-owned store sales performance for stores that are open for the full year. Systemwide restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens and corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Systemwide restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens, and corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. See definition below for same store sales.\nCorporate-Owned Restaurant Sales\nCorporate-owned restaurant sales represent the sales generated only by corporate-owned restaurants that are open for the full year. Corporate-owned restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Corporate-owned restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. These measures highlight the performance of existing corporate-owned restaurants.\nFranchise Restaurant Sales\nFranchise restaurant sales represent the sales generated only by franchisee-owned restaurants that are open for the full year. Franchise restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Franchise restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. These measures highlight the performance of existing franchised restaurants.\nSame Store Sales\nWe use the measure of same store sales to evaluate the performance of our store base, which excludes the impact of new stores and closed stores, in both periods under comparison. We include a restaurant in the calculation of same store sales once it has been in operation after 14 months. A restaurant which is temporarily closed (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), is included in the same store sales computation. A restaurant which is closed permanently, such as upon termination of the lease, or other permanent closure, is immediately removed from the same store sales computation. Our calculation of same store sales may not be comparable to others in the industry.\nDigital Channel Orders\nWe use the measure of digital channel orders to measure performance of our investments made in our digital platform and partnerships with third party delivery partners. We believe our digital platform capabilities are a vital element to continuing to serve our customers and will continue to be a differentiator for BurgerFi as compared to some of our competitors. Digital channel orders growth refers to the percentage change in sales through our digital platforms in one period from the same period in the prior year for all franchised and corporate-owned restaurants. Digital channel orders and digital channel orders as percentages of systemwide sales are indicative of the number of orders placed through our digital platforms and the percentage of those digital orders when compared to total number of orders at all our franchised and corporate-owned restaurants.\nBy providing these key metrics, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nTo reflect the application of different bases of accounting as a result of the BurgerFi acquisition, the tables provided below separate the Company's 2020 results via a black line into two distinct periods as follows: (1) up to and including the BurgerFi acquisition closing date (labeled Predecessor\u201d) and (2) the period after that date through December 31, 2020 (labeled Successor\u201d). The period after December 15, 2020 is the Successor\u201d period while the period before December 16, 2020 is the Predecessor\u201d period.\nThe historical financial information of OPES (a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC\u201d) prior to the BurgerFi acquisition has not been reflected in the Predecessor financial statements as these historical amounts have been determined not to be useful information to a user of the financial statements. SPACs deposit the proceeds from their initial public offerings into a segregated trust account until a business combination occurs, where such funds are then used to pay consideration for the acquiree and/or to pay stockholders who elect to redeem their shares of common stock in connection with the business combination. The operations of a SPAC, until the closing of a business combination, other than income from the trust account investments and transaction expenses, are nominal. Accordingly, no other activity in the Company was reported for the period prior to December 16, 2020 besides BurgerFi's operations as Predecessor.\nAs OPES's historical financial information is excluded from the Predecessor financial information, the businesses, and thus financial results, of the Successor and Predecessor entities, are expected to be largely consistent, excluding the impact on certain financial statement line items that were impacted by the BurgerFi acquisition. Management believes reviewing our operating results for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 by combining the results of the Predecessor and Successor periods ( S/P Combined\u201d) is more useful in discussing our overall operating performance when compared to the same period in the current year. Accordingly, in addition to presenting our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), the tables below present the non-GAAP combined results for the year. The results of operations of Anthony's is included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date of November 3, 2021.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

ended December 31, 2021, the Company's restaurant sales increased by approximately $32.8 million or 131% as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Anthony's, which contributed approximately $22.4 million, or 68% of the increase in restaurant sales. The remaining increase of $10.4 million resulted from the operation of eight, net, new BurgerFi corporate-owned restaurants and an increase in same store sales of 14% for BurgerFi during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. Same store sales increases were driven by recovering customer demand, the introduction of our SWAG burger (Spicy Wagyu burger) in March 2021, as well as higher average transaction values resulting from price increases which took effect in June 2021.\nRoyalty and Other Fees\nRoyalty and other fees increased by approximately $1.7 million, or 26% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in our franchisees' sales. For the year ended December 31, 2021, franchisee sales increased by 30% as compared to that of S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020.\nRoyalties - Brand Development and Co-op\nRoyalties - brand development and co-op advertising increased by approximately $0.5 million, or 31% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the reinstatement of brand development programs that were suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak and an increase in our franchisees' sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, franchisee sales increased by 30% as compared to that of S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020.\nRestaurant Level Operating Expenses\nRestaurant level

As such, expenses as a percentage of sales for Anthony's are not necessarily representative or comparable of that of a full quarter or a full period for Anthony's.\nTotal restaurant level operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 87.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 88.3% for the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 110 basis points. This 110 basis points decrease is attributable to a change in our sales mix, more efficiently managing our costs of delivery through third party suppliers and reduced other store operating expenses, and leverage on occupancy costs, which are primarily fixed in nature.\nFood, Beverage and Paper Costs\nFood, beverage, and paper costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased approximately $9.5 million, or 125% as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Anthony's, which contributed approximately $6.4 million, or 67% of the increase. The remaining increase of $3.1 million resulted from the operation of eight, net, new BurgerFi corporate-owned restaurants and an increase in same store sales of 14% during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of restaurant sales, food, beverage and paper costs were 29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 30.5% for the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This 80 basis points decrease primarily resulted from a change in our sales mix and increases in menu pricing during the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by higher costs of food and paper products as a result of inflationary pressures.\nLabor and Related Expenses\nLabor and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately $9.8 million, or 151% as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Anthony's, which contributed approximately $6.7 million, or 68% of the increase. The remaining increase of $3.1 million resulted from the operation of eight, net, new BurgerFi corporate-owned restaurants, along with fewer employees in our corporate-owned restaurants during the month of March 2020. As a percentage of corporate restaurant sales, labor and related expenses were 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 25.9% for the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This 230 basis points increase is due to increased labor costs experienced in our restaurants as compared to that of the prior period stemming from staffing challenges resulting from COVID-19 as well as employee salary increases.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately $6.8 million, or 129% as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Anthony's, which contributed approximately $4.3 million, or 64% of the increase. The remaining increase of $2.5 million resulted from the operation of eight, net, new BurgerFi corporate-owned restaurants. As a percentage of corporate restaurant sales, other operating expenses were 20.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 21.0% for the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This 20 basis points decrease primarily relates to sales increases during the year ended December 31, 2021, creating leverage on certain store operating costs that are not variable with sales.\nOccupancy and Related Expenses\nOccupancy and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately $2.2 million, or 82% as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Anthony's, which contributed approximately $1.9 million, or 87% of the increase. The remaining increase of $0.3 million resulted from the operation of eight, net, new BurgerFi corporate-owned restaurants. As a percentage of corporate restaurant sales, occupancy and related expenses were 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 10.9% for the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This 240 basis points decrease relates to sale increases during the year ended December 31, 2021, creating leverage on occupancy costs, which are primarily fixed in nature.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately $9.5 million, or 122% as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase partially related to Anthony's general and administrative expenses for two months, which contributed approximately $1.3 million, or 13% of the increase. The remaining increase of $8.2 million was primarily driven by merger and acquisition-related expenses of $3.7 million, legal, professional, and insurance fees and other miscellaneous expenses of $2.8 million, and labor and related costs of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. These increases were a result of investments made related to the acquisition of Anthony's, costs associated with the operation of being a public company beginning in December 2020, and the investments to support the increased development and growth of our restaurants.\nPre-opening Costs\nPre-opening costs were $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $0.2 million during the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of opening ten new stores during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to two stores during the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. Pre-opening costs include all expenses incurred by a restaurant prior to the restaurant's opening for business. These pre-opening costs include costs to relocate and reimburse restaurant management staff members, costs to recruit and train hourly restaurant staff members, wages, travel, and lodging costs for our training team and other support staff members, as well as rent expense. Pre-opening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific pre-opening costs incurred for each restaurant.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nStock compensation expense was $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $0.8 million for the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of restricted stock unit awards under the Company's 2020 Stock Incentive Plan in 2021. There were very limited awards for the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $1.4 million for the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $8.7 million was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2021. These intangible assets were in relation to the BurgerFi acquisition in December 2020. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to operating more stores than in the prior period.\nBrand Development and Co-op Advertising Expense\nBrand development and co-op advertising expense increased by approximately $0.1 million, or 6% as compared to the S/P Combined year-ended December 31, 2020. This increase relates to the signing of a new agency during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther Income, net\nOther income increased by approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of $2.2 million of debt forgiveness on all of our PPP loans, offset by loss on disposal of assets.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was approximately $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $0.1 million during the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is primarily due to non-cash interest expense of $0.6 million in relation to our preferred stock and $0.7 million due to an increase in debt as a result of the Anthony's acquisition.\nChange in Value of Warrant Liability\nThe Company recorded a non-cash gain of approximately $13.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to change in the fair value of the warrant liability as compared to a gain of $5.6 million during the Successor period from December 16, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The increase in the gain is primarily attributable to the decrease in value of the warrant liability primarily due to a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. There were no warrants outstanding in the Predecessor period.\nImpairment Expense\nAs part of the Company's annual goodwill assessment and impairment assessment at the end of each reporting period for long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets, the Company recorded asset impairment charges of approximately $114.8 million. This impairment charge was primarily related to a goodwill impairment charge of $106.5 million and a definite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $7.7 million in relation to the Company's BurgerFi reporting unit. The majority of the goodwill impairment amount was driven by the impact on the Company's market capitalization due to the decrease in stock price, coupled with significant decline to the equity values of our peers. The impairment amount for definite-lived intangible assets was primarily the result of a change in estimate of the remaining life of a licensing agreement.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million, primarily as a result of a valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets. This resulted in an effective tax rate of less than 1.0%. For the Successor period from December 16, 2020 to December 31, 2020, the Company recorded income tax benefit of $0.4 million.\nPrior to the BurgerFi acquisition, the Predecessor had elected to be taxed as a partnership under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Therefore, there was no income tax recorded by the Company for the comparable Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 to December 15, 2020.\nNet (Loss) Income\nNet loss was approximately $121.5 million and net income was approximately $6.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and for the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. This change is primarily the result of a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $114.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, and definite-lived intangible assets. In addition, the Company's general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately $9.5 million, or 122% as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. $8.2 million of this increase was primarily a result of investments made related to the acquisition of Anthony's, the operation of a public company beginning in December 2020, and the investments to support the increased development and growth of our restaurants.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nAs appropriate, we supplement our reported U.S. GAAP financial information with certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before the change in value of warrant liability, interest expense (which includes the change in value of preferred stock), income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, pre-opening costs, store closure costs, gain on extinguishment of debt, legal settlements, merger, acquisition, and integration costs, and impairment charges.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance, both internally and as compared with our peers, because this measure excludes certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results, as well as items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. We believe that this adjusted measure provides a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business.\nWe believe that this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure provides meaningful information and helps investors understand our financial results and assess our prospects for future performance. Because non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-U.S. GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or alternative measures of, reported net income or diluted earnings per share, and should be viewed in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and the provided reconciliations thereto. We believe this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, when viewed together with our U.S. GAAP results and the related reconciliations, provides a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nBelow is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net (loss) income on a consolidated basis and by segment:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of December 31, 2021, we maintained a cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately $15 million.\nOur primary requirements for liquidity are to fund our working capital needs, operating and finance lease obligations, capital expenditures and general corporate needs. Our requirements for working capital are generally not significant because our guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or on debit or credit cards at the time of the sale and we are able to sell many of our inventory items before payment is due to the supplier of such items. Our ongoing capital expenditures are principally related to opening new restaurants, remodels and maintenance, as well as investments in our digital and corporate infrastructure. We estimate our capital expenditures will be approximately $4 million for the year ending December 31, 2022.\nDuring March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly spreading outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus designated COVID-19. The pandemic has significantly impacted economic conditions in the United States, where all of our Company restaurants are located. While the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have partially subsided, its effects vary by region, and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to disrupt economic conditions and business activities, particularly as new variants of COVID-19 arise. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent and emerging variants, could affect our business, operations and financial results is uncertain as it will depend upon numerous evolving factors that management may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and the continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19. The acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, along with the length and extent of any continuing economic and market disruptions, are unknown, and therefore, any future impacts on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations cannot be quantified or predicted with specificity.\nWe have implemented price increases to mitigate the inflationary effects of food and labor costs, however we cannot predict the long-term impact of these negative economic conditions on our restaurant profitability. Although we have experienced some recovery since the initial impact of COVID-19 and are able to meet our obligations as they become due with our cash flow from operations, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the economy and on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted. In addition, we continue to monitor the spread of new variants, including the pandemic's emergence of variants.\nWe are currently able to pay our obligations as they become due for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future, with our cash flow generated from operations and our cash on hand balance of $15 million. We are committed to constructing four additional restaurants within the next 12 months. The total amount remaining due on these contracts is approximately $1.0 million. We believe that we will be able to pay these commitments from our current cash balance. Should federal, state or municipal government authorities impose mandatory restrictions in excess of what they currently are, we believe that our current cash balance will allow us the liquidity to meet our commitments as they become due.\nThe following table presents the summary cash flow information for the periods indicated:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Successor </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Predecessor </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 16, 2020\nthrough\nJanuary 1, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 1, 2020\nthrough\nDecember 15, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,467) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(938) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,696 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,015) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,549) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>620 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,012) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,943) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,494) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(28,487) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Used in Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows used in operating activities were approximately $7.5 million. The cash flows used in operating activities resulted from a net loss of $121.5 million, which was primarily related to non-cash impairment charges of $114.8 million related to goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, depreciation and amortization of $10.1 million, and share-based compensation of $7.6 million, offset by a gain on change in value of warrant liability of $13.8 million. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net asset increase, which was mainly due to a decrease in accrued expenses, primarily as a result of payment of acquisition-related costs associated with the Anthony's acquisition as well as payment of accrued compensation, offset by an increase in deferred rent and other liabilities. Our deferred rent and other liabilities increase is due to the opening of new corporate-owned restaurants during the year ended December 31, 2021 as well as several restaurants under construction as of December 31, 2021.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows used in investing activities were approximately $5.0 million, which was primarily the result of construction costs of $10.7 million, offset by a cash increase from the acquisition of Anthony's of approximately $5.5 million.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $13.0 million, which was primarily related to a $3.0 million repayment and termination of one of the Company's lines of credit and payments on notes payable of approximately $9.2 million.\nCredit Agreement\nOn November 3, 2021 and as part of the Anthony's acquisition, the Company joined a credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks providing Anthony's with up to $71.8 million in financing (\"Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement, which terminates on June 15, 2024, provides the Company with lender financing structured as a $57.8 million term loan, a $4 million revolving loan, and a $10 million delayed draw term loan facility (the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility\u201d) provided by a related party and a significant shareholder. The terms of the Credit Agreement require the Company to repay the principal of the term loan in quarterly installments of approximately $0.8 million with the balance due at the maturity date. The principal amount of revolving loans is due and payable in full on the maturity date. The loan and revolving line of credit are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and incurs interest on outstanding amounts at 4.75% per annum through June 15, 2023 and 6.75% from June 16, 2023 through maturity while the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility is a non-interest bearing loan. Pursuant to the terms of an amendment to the Credit Agreement effective as of March 9, 2022, certain of the covenants of (i) the Company and Plastic Tripod, Inc., as the borrowers (the \"Borrowers\"), and (ii) the subsidiary guarantors (the \"Guarantors\") party to the Credit Agreement were amended, and the Borrowers and Guarantors agreed to pay incremental deferred interest of 2% per annum, in the event that the Credit Agreement is not repaid on or prior to June 15, 2023; provided, however, that if no event of default has occurred and is continuing then (1) no incremental deferred interest will be due if all of the obligations under the Credit Agreement have been paid on or prior to December 31, 2022, and (2) only 50% of the incremental deferred interest will be owed if all of the obligations under the Credit Agreement have been paid from and after January 1, 2023 and on or prior to March 31, 2023.\nRedeemable Preferred Stock\nOn November 3, 2021, and as part of the Anthony's acquisition, the Company issued 2,120,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock as Series A Junior Preferred Stock. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is redeemable on November 3, 2027 and accrues dividends at 7.00% per annum compounded quarterly from June 15, 2024 with such rate increasing by an additional 0.35% per quarter commencing with the three month period ending September 30, 2024 and (b) in the event that the Credit Agreement is refinanced or repaid in full prior to June 15, 2024 and the Series A Junior Preferred Stock is not redeemed in full on such date, from and after such date, shall accrue dividends at 5.00% per annum, compounded quarterly, until June 15, 2024.\nThe Series A Junior Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Common Stock and may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time and must be redeemed by the Company in limited circumstances. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock shall not have voting rights or conversion rights. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to confirm that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:\n\u2022Goodwill\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting unit using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies' data. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and an impairment loss is recorded. The estimated fair value of goodwill is subject to change as a result of many factors including, among others, any changes in our business plans, changing economic conditions and the competitive environment. Refer to Note 14 Fair Value Measurements for more information.\n\u2022Long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the end of each reporting period or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, negative cash flow, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is being used, an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nTo estimate future cash flows, we make certain assumptions about expected future operating performance, such as revenue growth rates, royalties, gross margins, and operating expense in relation to the current economic environment and the Company's future expectations. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company's experience and knowledge of its operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value.\nFor more information, refer to Note 6 Impairment and Note 14 Fair Value Measurements.\n\u2022Warrant Liability\nThe fair value of our warrant liability is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend rate and service period. Refer to Note 14 Fair Value Measurements for more information.\n\u2022Acquisitions\nThe determination of the fair value of net assets acquired in an acquisition requires estimates and judgments of future cash flow expectations for the acquired business and the related identifiable tangible and intangible assets. Fair values of net assets acquired are calculated using expected cash flows and industry-standard valuation techniques. For current assets and current liabilities, book value is generally assumed to equal fair value.\nDue to the time required to gather and analyze the necessary data for each acquisition, U.S. GAAP provides a measurement period\u201d of up to one year in which to finalize these fair value determinations. During the measurement period, preliminary fair value estimates may be revised if new information is obtained about the facts and circumstances existing as of the date of acquisition, or based on the final net assets and working capital of the acquired business, as prescribed in the applicable purchase agreement. Such adjustments may result in the recognition of, or an adjustment to the fair values of, acquisition-related assets and liabilities and/or consideration paid, and are referred to as measurement period adjustments.\u201d Measurement period adjustments are recorded to goodwill. Other revisions to fair value estimates for acquisitions are reflected as income or expense, as appropriate.\nConsideration paid generally consists of cash and, from time to time, shares, and potential future payments that are contingent upon the acquired business achieving certain levels of earnings in the future, also referred to as acquisition-related contingent consideration\u201d or earn-outs.\u201d Earn-out liabilities are measured at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, if future Earn-out payments are expected to differ from Earn-out payments estimated as of the date of acquisition, any related fair value adjustments, including those related to finalization of completed earn-out arrangements, are recognized in the period that such expectation is considered probable. Changes in the fair value of Earn-out liabilities for the Company's traditional earn-outs, other than those related to measurement period adjustments, as described above, are recorded within other income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRefer to Note 5 Acquisitions for additional information.\n\u2022Income Taxes\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of our provision for income taxes, in the resulting tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. Refer to Note 12 Income Taxes for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months and disclose certain information about the leasing arrangements. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company will elect the package of practical expedients, as well as the hindsight practical expedient, permitted under the new guidance, which includes allowing the Company to continue utilizing historical classification of leases. In preparation for the adoption, the Company is implementing new accounting systems, business processes and internal controls to assist in the application of the new guidance. As an emerging growth company, this guidance is effective for our fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases which will result in additional assets and corresponding liabilities of approximately $60 million to $65 million on the consolidated balance sheet, with no material impact to its consolidated statement of operations, stockholders' equity, or cash flows. Our assessment is ongoing and subject to finalization such that the actual impact may differ from the estimated range.\nThe FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ( Topic 326\u201d) in June 2016, subsequently amended by various standard updates. This guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information when determining credit loss estimates and requires financial assets to be measured net of expected credit losses at the time of initial recognition. As an emerging growth company, this guidance will be effective for our fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes ( Topic 740\u201d) as part of its Simplification Initiative. This guidance provides amendments to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 Reference Rate Reform ( Topic 848\u201d) to provide optional guidance for a limited period of time, from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022, to ease the burden of financial reporting due to reference rate reform. An entity can elect to utilize the guidance at any time during the period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), an amendment that simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity's own equity. The amendment simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current accounting guidance. In addition, the amendment removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exception, and also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The amendment is effective beginning after December 15, 2023 for smaller reporting companies. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nSale of Dania Beach Restaurant to Franchisee\nIn February 2020, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with an unrelated third-party for the sale of substantially all of the assets used in connection with the operation of BF Dania Beach, LLC for an aggregate purchase price of $1.3 million. From January to March 2020, the Company received three cash deposits totaling $0.9 million in connection with this transaction. The closing of this transaction has been delayed due to additional negotiation that has been on-going through the report date of April 14, 2022. In the event the transaction is terminated, the Company will resume operation of the restaurant, and return the $0.9 million to the unrelated third-party purchaser. Assets used in the operations of BF Dania Beach, LLC have been classified as held for sale and the deposit is included within the December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial results and operations of a leading multi-brand restaurant company that owns and operates BurgerFi and Anthony's.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and footnotes thereto incorporated by reference included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nThe Company is a leading multi-brand restaurant company that develops, markets and acquires fast-casual and premium-casual dining restaurant concepts around the world, including corporate-owned stores and franchises. As of December 31, 2021, we were the owner and franchisor of the two following brands:\nBurgerFi. BurgerFi is a fast-casual better burger\u201d concept, renowned for delivering an exceptional, all-natural premium better burger\u201d experience in a refined, contemporary environment. BurgerFi's chef-driven menu offerings and eco-friendly restaurant design drive our brand communication. It offers a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, frozen custard, hand-cut fries, shakes, beer, wine and more. Originally founded in 2011 in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida, the purpose was simple - RedeFining\u201d the way the world eats burgers by providing an upscale burger offering, at a fast-casual price point. BurgerFi is committed to an uncompromising and rewarding dining experience that promises fresh food of transparent quality. Since its inception, BurgerFi has grown to 118 BurgerFi locations, and as of December 31, 2021, was comprised of 25 corporate-owned restaurants and 93 franchised restaurants in 2 countries and 22 states, as well as Puerto Rico.\nBurgerFi was named Best Fast Casual Restaurant\u201d in USA Today's 10Best 2022 Readers Choice Awards for the second consecutive year, QSR Magazine's Breakout Brand of 2020, Fast Casual's 2021 #1 Brand of the Year and included in Inc. Magazine's Fastest Growing Private Companies List. In 2021, Consumer Report's Chain Reaction Report praised BurgerFi for serving no antibiotic beef\u201d across all its restaurants, and Consumer Reports awarded BurgerFi an \"A-Grade Angus Beef\" rating for the third consecutive year.\nAnthony's. Anthony's is a premium pizza and wing brand operating 61 corporate-owned casual restaurant locations, as of December 31, 2021. Anthony's prides itself on serving fresh, never frozen, high-quality ingredients. The concept is centered around a 900-degree coal fired oven, and its menu offers well-done\u201d pizza, coal fired chicken wings, homemade meatballs, and a variety of handcrafted sandwiches and salads. The restaurants also feature a deep wine and craft beer selection to round out the menu. The pizzas are prepared using a unique coal fired oven to quickly seal in natural flavors while creating a lightly charred crust. Anthony's provides a differentiated offering among its casual dining peers driven by its coal fired oven, which enables the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients with quicker ticket times.\nSince its inception in 2002, the Anthony's brand has grown to 61 corporate-owned locations, as of December 31, 2021, primarily along the East coast and has restaurants in eight states, including Florida (28), Pennsylvania (12), New Jersey (8), New York (5), Massachusetts (4), Delaware (2), Maryland (1), and Rhode Island (1).\nAnthony's was named The Best Pizza Chain in America\" by USA Today's Great American Bites and Top 3 Best Major Pizza Chain\u201d by Mashed in 2021.\nBeyond our current brand portfolio, we intend to acquire other restaurant concepts that will allow us to grow and also offer additional food categories. In evaluating potential acquisitions, we specifically seek concepts with, among others, the following characteristics:\n\u2022established, recognized brands;\n\u2022long-term, sustainable operating performance;\n\u2022consistent cash flows; and\n\u2022growth potential, both geographically and through co-branding initiatives across our portfolio.\nIntending to leverage our developing management platform, we expect to achieve cost synergies post-acquisition by reducing the corporate overhead of the acquired company. We also plan to grow the top line revenues of newly acquired brands through support from our management and systems platform, franchising, marketing and advertising, supply chain assistance, site selection analysis, staff training and operational oversight and support.\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn November 3, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Anthony's, which through its subsidiaries, owns and operates casual dining pizza restaurants under the trade name Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza & Wings. The results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Anthony's is included in our consolidated financial statements as of the closing date of the acquisition.\nSegments\nWe have two operating and reportable segments: (1) BurgerFi and (2) Anthony's. Our business generates revenue from the following sources: (i) restaurant sales, (ii) royalty and other fees, consisting primarily of royalties based on a percentage of sales reported by franchised restaurants and paid by franchisees, and (iii) franchise fees, consisting primarily of licensing fees paid by franchisees.\nSignificant Recent Developments Regarding COVID-19\nDuring March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly spreading outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus designated COVID-19. The pandemic has significantly impacted economic conditions in the United States, where all of our corporate-owned restaurants are located. While the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have partially subsided, its effects vary by region, and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to disrupt economic conditions and business activities, particularly as new outbreaks and variants of COVID-19 arise. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent and emerging variants, could affect our business, operations and financial results is uncertain as it will depend upon numerous evolving factors that management may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and the continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19. The acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, along with the length and extent of any continuing economic and market disruptions, are unknown, and therefore, any future impacts on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations cannot be quantified or predicted with specificity.\nWe believe that we have taken appropriate steps to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and our business model has, thus far, proven resilient. We continue to actively monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and to the extent that future business activities are adversely affected by the pandemic, we intend to take appropriate actions designed to mitigate these impacts. We continue to adapt to the changing operational and economic environment that has resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our top priority has been to take appropriate actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and business partners, and we continue to monitor evolving health guidelines and respond to changes as appropriate. Notwithstanding moderation of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental and other restrictions, we may continue to experience negative effects on our business and operations from possible longer-term changes in consumer and customer behavior and/or from negative economic conditions, including recent inflationary effects on labor and food costs, supply chain disruptions and availability of labor.\nWe did not experience any material supply chain disruptions as a result of COVID-19 during 2020 or 2021; however, there can be no assurance that we will not experience supply chain challenges in the future. We have implemented price increases to mitigate the inflationary effects of food and labor costs; however, we cannot predict the long-term impact of these negative economic conditions on our restaurant profitability. Although we have experienced some recovery since the initial impact of COVID-19 and are able to meet our obligations as they become due with our cash flow from operations, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the economy and on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted. In addition, despite a recent decline in cases, hospitalizations and deaths in large portions of the United States, mask mandates, social-distancing, travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders could be reinstated. We may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing, reducing capital spending, or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business. Refer to the matters discussed under the caption Risk Factors\u201d beginning on page 10.\nKey Metrics\nThe following key metrics are important indicators of the overall direction of our business, including trends in sales and the effectiveness of our marketing, operating, and growth initiatives for the BurgerFi brand:\n\nSystemwide Restaurant Sales\nSystemwide restaurant sales is presented as informational data in order to understand the aggregation of franchised stores sales, ghost kitchen and corporate-owned store sales performance for stores that are open for the full year. Systemwide restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens and corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Systemwide restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens, and corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. See definition below for same store sales.\nCorporate-Owned Restaurant Sales\nCorporate-owned restaurant sales represent the sales generated only by corporate-owned restaurants that are open for the full year. Corporate-owned restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Corporate-owned restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. These measures highlight the performance of existing corporate-owned restaurants.\nFranchise Restaurant Sales\nFranchise restaurant sales represent the sales generated only by franchisee-owned restaurants that are open for the full year. Franchise restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Franchise restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. These measures highlight the performance of existing franchised restaurants.\nSame Store Sales\nWe use the measure of same store sales to evaluate the performance of our store base, which excludes the impact of new stores and closed stores, in both periods under comparison. We include a restaurant in the calculation of same store sales once it has been in operation after 14 months. A restaurant which is temporarily closed (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), is included in the same store sales computation. A restaurant which is closed permanently, such as upon termination of the lease, or other permanent closure, is immediately removed from the same store sales computation. Our calculation of same store sales may not be comparable to others in the industry.\nDigital Channel Orders\nWe use the measure of digital channel orders to measure performance of our investments made in our digital platform and partnerships with third party delivery partners. We believe our digital platform capabilities are a vital element to continuing to serve our customers and will continue to be a differentiator for BurgerFi as compared to some of our competitors. Digital channel orders growth refers to the percentage change in sales through our digital platforms in one period from the same period in the prior year for all franchised and corporate-owned restaurants. Digital channel orders and digital channel orders as percentages of systemwide sales are indicative of the number of orders placed through our digital platforms and the percentage of those digital orders when compared to total number of orders at all our franchised and corporate-owned restaurants.\nBy providing these key metrics, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nTo reflect the application of different bases of accounting as a result of the BurgerFi acquisition, the tables provided below separate the Company's 2020 results via a black line into two distinct periods as follows: (1) up to and including the BurgerFi acquisition closing date (labeled Predecessor\u201d) and (2) the period after that date through December 31, 2020 (labeled Successor\u201d). The period after December 15, 2020 is the Successor\u201d period while the period before December 16, 2020 is the Predecessor\u201d period.\nThe historical financial information of OPES (a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC\u201d) prior to the BurgerFi acquisition has not been reflected in the Predecessor financial statements as these historical amounts have been determined not to be useful information to a user of the financial statements. SPACs deposit the proceeds from their initial public offerings into a segregated trust account until a business combination occurs, where such funds are then used to pay consideration for the acquiree and/or to pay stockholders who elect to redeem their shares of common stock in connection with the business combination. The operations of a SPAC, until the closing of a business combination, other than income from the trust account investments and transaction expenses, are nominal. Accordingly, no other activity in the Company was reported for the period prior to December 16, 2020 besides BurgerFi's operations as Predecessor.\nAs OPES's historical financial information is excluded from the Predecessor financial information, the businesses, and thus financial results, of the Successor and Predecessor entities, are expected to be largely consistent, excluding the impact on certain financial statement line items that were impacted by the BurgerFi acquisition. Management believes reviewing our operating results for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 by combining the results of the Predecessor and Successor periods ( S/P Combined\u201d) is more useful in discussing our overall operating performance when compared to the same period in the current year. Accordingly, in addition to presenting our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), the tables below present the non-GAAP combined results for the year. The results of operations of Anthony's is included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date of November 3, 2021.\n\nSales\nThe following table presents our corporate-owned restaurant sales by segment:\n Successor Predecessor S/P Combined (non-GAAP) (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 * December 16, 2020 through December 31, 2020 January 1, 2020 through December 15, 2020 Year Ended December 31, 2020 BurgerFi Restaurant sales 35,371 1,333 23,683 25,016 Royalty and other fees 8,021 255 6,116 6,371 Royalty - brand development and co-op 1,987 74 1,441 1,515 Franchise fees 1,069 25 1,055 1,080 Total BurgerFi $ 46,448 $ 1,687 $ 32,295 $ 33,982 Anthony's Restaurant sales $ 22,419 $ - $ - $ - Total Anthony's $ 22,419 $ - $ - $ - Total Consolidated $ 68,867 $ 1,687 $ 32,295 $ 33,982 * Amounts for Anthony's are only presented from November 3, 2021, the date of acquisition. \nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (S/P Combined)\nRestaurant Sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company's restaurant sales increased by approximately $32.8 million or 131% as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Anthony's, which contributed approximately $22.4 million, or 68% of the increase in restaurant sales. The remaining increase of $10.4 million resulted from the operation of eight, net, new BurgerFi corporate-owned restaurants and an increase in same store sales of 14% for BurgerFi during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. Same store sales increases were driven by recovering customer demand, the introduction of our SWAG burger (Spicy Wagyu burger) in March 2021, as well as higher average transaction values resulting from price increases which took effect in June 2021.\nRoyalty and Other Fees\nRoyalty and other fees increased by approximately $1.7 million, or 26% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in our franchisees' sales. For the year ended December 31, 2021, franchisee sales increased by 30% as compared to that of S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020.\nRoyalties - Brand Development and Co-op\nRoyalties - brand development and co-op advertising increased by approximately $0.5 million, or 31% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the reinstatement of brand development programs that were suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak and an increase in our franchisees' sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, franchisee sales increased by 30% as compared to that of S/P Combined year ended December 31, 2020.\nRestaurant Level Operating Expenses\nRestaurant level operating expenses are as follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and footnotes thereto incorporated by reference included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nThe Company is a leading multi-brand restaurant company that develops, markets and acquires fast-casual and premium-casual dining restaurant concepts around the world, including corporate-owned stores and franchises. As of December 31, 2021, we were the owner and franchisor of the two following brands:\nBurgerFi. BurgerFi is a fast-casual better burger\u201d concept, renowned for delivering an exceptional, all-natural premium better burger\u201d experience in a refined, contemporary environment. BurgerFi's chef-driven menu offerings and eco-friendly restaurant design drive our brand communication. It offers a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, frozen custard, hand-cut fries, shakes, beer, wine and more. Originally founded in 2011 in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida, the purpose was simple - RedeFining\u201d the way the world eats burgers by providing an upscale burger offering, at a fast-casual price point. BurgerFi is committed to an uncompromising and rewarding dining experience that promises fresh food of transparent quality. Since its inception, BurgerFi has grown to 118 BurgerFi locations, and as of December 31, 2021, was comprised of 25 corporate-owned restaurants and 93 franchised restaurants in 2 countries and 22 states, as well as Puerto Rico.\nBurgerFi was named Best Fast Casual Restaurant\u201d in USA Today's 10Best 2022 Readers Choice Awards for the second consecutive year, QSR Magazine's Breakout Brand of 2020, Fast Casual's 2021 #1 Brand of the Year and included in Inc. Magazine's Fastest Growing Private Companies List. In 2021, Consumer Report's Chain Reaction Report praised BurgerFi for serving no antibiotic beef\u201d across all its restaurants, and Consumer Reports awarded BurgerFi an \"A-Grade Angus Beef\" rating for the third consecutive year.\nAnthony's. Anthony's is a premium pizza and wing brand operating 61 corporate-owned casual restaurant locations, as of December 31, 2021. Anthony's prides itself on serving fresh, never frozen, high-quality ingredients. The concept is centered around a 900-degree coal fired oven, and its menu offers well-done\u201d pizza, coal fired chicken wings, homemade meatballs, and a variety of handcrafted sandwiches and salads. The restaurants also feature a deep wine and craft beer selection to round out the menu. The pizzas are prepared using a unique coal fired oven to quickly seal in natural flavors while creating a lightly charred crust. Anthony's provides a differentiated offering among its casual dining peers driven by its coal fired oven, which enables the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients with quicker ticket times.\nSince its inception in 2002, the Anthony's brand has grown to 61 corporate-owned locations, as of December 31, 2021, primarily along the East coast and has restaurants in eight states, including Florida (28), Pennsylvania (12), New Jersey (8), New York (5), Massachusetts (4), Delaware (2), Maryland (1), and Rhode Island (1).\nAnthony's was named The Best Pizza Chain in America\" by USA Today's Great American Bites and Top 3 Best Major Pizza Chain\u201d by Mashed in 2021.\nBeyond our current brand portfolio, we intend to acquire other restaurant concepts that will allow us to grow and also offer additional food categories. In evaluating potential acquisitions, we specifically seek concepts with, among others, the following characteristics:\n\u2022established, recognized brands;\n\u2022long-term, sustainable operating performance;\n\u2022consistent cash flows; and\n\u2022growth potential, both geographically and through co-branding initiatives across our portfolio.\nIntending to leverage our developing management platform, we expect to achieve cost synergies post-acquisition by reducing the corporate overhead of the acquired company. We also plan to grow the top line revenues of newly acquired brands through support from our management and systems platform, franchising, marketing and advertising, supply chain assistance, site selection analysis, staff training and operational oversight and support.\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn November 3, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Anthony's, which through its subsidiaries, owns and operates casual dining pizza restaurants under the trade name Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza & Wings. The results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Anthony's is included in our consolidated financial statements as of the closing date of the acquisition.\nSegments\nWe have two operating and reportable segments: (1) BurgerFi and (2) Anthony's. Our business generates revenue from the following sources: (i) restaurant sales, (ii) royalty and other fees, consisting primarily of royalties based on a percentage of sales reported by franchised restaurants and paid by franchisees, and (iii) franchise fees, consisting primarily of licensing fees paid by franchisees.\nSignificant Recent Developments Regarding COVID-19\nDuring March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly spreading outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus designated COVID-19. The pandemic has significantly impacted economic conditions in the United States, where all of our corporate-owned restaurants are located. While the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have partially subsided, its effects vary by region, and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to disrupt economic conditions and business activities, particularly as new outbreaks and variants of COVID-19 arise. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent and emerging variants, could affect our business, operations and financial results is uncertain as it will depend upon numerous evolving factors that management may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and the continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19. The acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, along with the length and extent of any continuing economic and market disruptions, are unknown, and therefore, any future impacts on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations cannot be quantified or predicted with specificity.\nWe believe that we have taken appropriate steps to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and our business model has, thus far, proven resilient. We continue to actively monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and to the extent that future business activities are adversely affected by the pandemic, we intend to take appropriate actions designed to mitigate these impacts. We continue to adapt to the changing operational and economic environment that has resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our top priority has been to take appropriate actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and business partners, and we continue to monitor evolving health guidelines and respond to changes as appropriate. Notwithstanding moderation of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental and other restrictions, we may continue to experience negative effects on our business and operations from possible longer-term changes in consumer and customer behavior and/or from negative economic conditions, including recent inflationary effects on labor and food costs, supply chain disruptions and availability of labor.\nWe did not experience any material supply chain disruptions as a result of COVID-19 during 2020 or 2021; however, there can be no assurance that we will not experience supply chain challenges in the future. We have implemented price increases to mitigate the inflationary effects of food and labor costs; however, we cannot predict the long-term impact of these negative economic conditions on our restaurant profitability. Although we have experienced some recovery since the initial impact of COVID-19 and are able to meet our obligations as they become due with our cash flow from operations, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the economy and on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted. In addition, despite a recent decline in cases, hospitalizations and deaths in large portions of the United States, mask mandates, social-distancing, travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders could be reinstated. We may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing, reducing capital spending, or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business. Refer to the matters discussed under the caption Risk Factors\u201d beginning on page 10.\nKey Metrics\nThe following key metrics are important indicators of the overall direction of our business, including trends in sales and the effectiveness of our marketing, operating, and growth initiatives for the BurgerFi brand:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except for percentage data) </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Systemwide Restaurant Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,866 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Systemwide Restaurant Sales Growth </td> <td>31% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Systemwide Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td>(12)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,977 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales Growth </td> <td>39% </td> <td> </td> <td>9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate-Owned Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td>(15)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Restaurant Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,860 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Restaurant Sales Growth </td> <td>30% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise Restaurant Same Store Sales Growth </td> <td>15% </td> <td> </td> <td>(11)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital Channel Orders Growth </td> <td>18% </td> <td> </td> <td>93% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital Channel Orders </td> <td>2,482 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,193 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital Channel Orders % of Systemwide Sales </td> <td>39% </td> <td> </td> <td>43% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSystemwide Restaurant Sales\nSystemwide restaurant sales is presented as informational data in order to understand the aggregation of franchised stores sales, ghost kitchen and corporate-owned store sales performance for stores that are open for the full year. Systemwide restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens and corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Systemwide restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens, and corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. See definition below for same store sales.\nCorporate-Owned Restaurant Sales\nCorporate-owned restaurant sales represent the sales generated only by corporate-owned restaurants that are open for the full year. Corporate-owned restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Corporate-owned restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. These measures highlight the performance of existing corporate-owned restaurants.\nFranchise Restaurant Sales\nFranchise restaurant sales represent the sales generated only by franchisee-owned restaurants that are open for the full year. Franchise restaurant sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Franchise restaurant same store sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants once the restaurant has been in operation after 14 months. These measures highlight the performance of existing franchised restaurants.\nSame Store Sales\nWe use the measure of same store sales to evaluate the performance of our store base, which excludes the impact of new stores and closed stores, in both periods under comparison. We include a restaurant in the calculation of same store sales once it has been in operation after 14 months. A restaurant which is temporarily closed (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), is included in the same store sales computation. A restaurant which is closed permanently, such as upon termination of the lease, or other permanent closure, is immediately removed from the same store sales computation. Our calculation of same store sales may not be comparable to others in the industry.\nDigital Channel Orders\nWe use the measure of digital channel orders to measure performance of our investments made in our digital platform and partnerships with third party delivery partners. We believe our digital platform capabilities are a vital element to continuing to serve our customers and will continue to be a differentiator for BurgerFi as compared to some of our competitors. Digital channel orders growth refers to the percentage change in sales through our digital platforms in one period from the same period in the prior year for all franchised and corporate-owned restaurants. Digital channel orders and digital channel orders as percentages of systemwide sales are indicative of the number of orders placed through our digital platforms and the percentage of those digital orders when compared to total number of orders at all our franchised and corporate-owned restaurants.\nBy providing these key metrics, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives.\nResults of Operations\nTo reflect the application of different bases of accounting as a result of the BurgerFi acquisition, the tables provided below separate the Company's 2020 results via a black line into two distinct periods as follows: (1) up to and including the BurgerFi acquisition closing date (labeled Predecessor\u201d) and (2) the period after that date through December 31, 2020 (labeled Successor\u201d). The period after December 15, 2020 is the Successor\u201d period while the period before December 16, 2020 is the Predecessor\u201d period.\nThe historical financial information of OPES (a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC\u201d) prior to the BurgerFi acquisition has not been reflected in the Predecessor financial statements as these historical amounts have been determined not to be useful information to a user of the financial statements. SPACs deposit the proceeds from their initial public offerings into a segregated trust account until a business combination occurs, where such funds are then used to pay consideration for the acquiree and/or to pay stockholders who elect to redeem their shares of common stock in connection with the business combination. The operations of a SPAC, until the closing of a business combination, other than income from the trust account investments and transaction expenses, are nominal. Accordingly, no other activity in the Company was reported for the period prior to December 16, 2020 besides BurgerFi's operations as Predecessor.\nAs OPES's historical financial information is excluded from the Predecessor financial information, the businesses, and thus financial results, of the Successor and Predecessor entities, are expected to be largely consistent, excluding the impact on certain financial statement line items that were impacted by the BurgerFi acquisition. Management believes reviewing our operating results for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 by combining the results of the Predecessor and Successor periods ( S/P Combined\u201d) is more useful in discussing our overall operating performance when compared to the same period in the current year. Accordingly, in addition to presenting our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), the tables below present the non-GAAP combined results for the year. The results of operations of Anthony's is included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date of November 3, 2021.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
