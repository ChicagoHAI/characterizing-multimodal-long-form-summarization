MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Our actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently deem immaterial could also cause our actual results to differ, including those discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nCompass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust, was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company, was also formed on November 18, 2005. In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust is sole owner of 100% of the Trust Interests (as defined in the LLC Agreement) of the Company and, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Company has outstanding, the identical number of Trust Interests as the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. Sostratus LLC owns all of our Allocation Interests. The Company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities, similar to that of a Delaware corporation.\nThe Trust and the Company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. We characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to $60 million. We focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more susceptible to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow.\nIn pursuing new acquisitions, we seek businesses with the following characteristics:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>North American base of operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>stable and growing earnings and cash flow;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche (i.e., has a reason to exist\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a diversified customer and supplier base.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our management team's strategy for our subsidiaries involves:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract, recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies (both revenue and cost related);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors, including independent directors, to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well- positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses. Our management team has a large network of approximately 2,000 deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team's active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. In consummating transactions, our management team has, in the past, been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations. We believe the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.\nIn addition, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our Revolving Credit Facility, we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate.\nInitial public offering and Company formation\nOn May 16, 2006, we completed our initial public offering of 13,500,000 shares of the Trust at an offering price of $15.00 per share (the IPO\u201d). Subsequent to the IPO the Company's board of directors engaged our Manager to externally manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company, oversee the management and operations of the businesses and to perform those services customarily performed by executive officers of a public company.\nFrom May 16, 2006 through December 31, 2018, we purchased nineteen businesses (each of our businesses is treated as a separate operating segment) and disposed of seven businesses. The tables below reflect summarized information relating to our acquisitions and dispositions from the date of our IPO through December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nAcquisitions\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ownership Interest - December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CODI Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Diluted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CBS Holdings (Staffmark) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crosman (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advanced Circuits (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silvue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tridien (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 1, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aeroglide\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Halo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>American Furniture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 31, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FOX (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 4, 2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liberty Safe (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ergobaby (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 16, 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CamelBak\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 24, 2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arnold Magnetics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 5, 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clean Earth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 7, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sterno (3) (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 10, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manitoba Harvest (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 10, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Velocity Outdoor (3) (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foam Fabricators\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The total purchase price for CBS Holdings includes the acquisition of Staffmark Investment LLC in January 2008 for a purchase price of $128.6 million. The Company renamed its CBS Personnel business Staffmark subsequent to the acquisition.\n(2) FOX completed an IPO of its common stock in August 2013 in which we sold a 22% interest in FOX, reducing our ownership interest to 53%. In July 2014, FOX completed a secondary offering in which we sold a 12% interest in FOX, reducing our ownership interest to 41% and resulting in the deconsolidation of FOX from our financial results. We subsequently sold our remaining shares of FOX and now hold no ownership interest in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sale of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million.\n(3) The total purchase price does not reflect add-on acquisitions made by our businesses subsequent to their purchase by CODI unless indicated.\n(4) The total purchase price of Sterno includes the acquisition of Rimports, Inc. in February 2018 for a purchase price of $154.4 million.\n(5) Velocity Outdoor (formerly \"Crosman Corp.\") was purchased by the Company in May 2006 and subsequently sold in January 2007.

In August 2013, FOX completed an initial public offering of its common stock. As a result of the initial public offering, our ownership interest in FOX was reduced to approximately 53.9%. No gain was reflected as a result of the sale of our FOX shares in the initial public offering because our majority classification of FOX did not change. FOX used a portion of their net proceeds received from the sale of their shares as well as proceeds from a new external FOX credit facility to repay $61.5 million in outstanding indebtedness to us under their existing credit facility with us. In July 2014, through a secondary offering, our ownership in FOX was lowered from approximately 53% to approximately 41%, and as a result we deconsolidated FOX as of July 10, 2014. In March and August 2016, through two more secondary offerings and a share repurchase by FOX, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 23% as of September 30, 2016. In November 2016, through another secondary offering, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 14%. On March 13, 2017, FOX closed on a secondary public offering of 5,108,718 shares of FOX common stock held by CODI, which represented CODI's remaining investment in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sales of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million, plus proceeds from the repayment of the FOX credit facility of $61.5 million upon completion of their initial public offering, and a total gain of $428.7 million.\nWe are dependent on the earnings of, and cash receipts from, the businesses that we own in order to meet our corporate overhead and management fee expenses and to pay distributions. The earnings and distributions of our businesses are generally lowest in the first quarter, and strongest in the third and fourth quarter, of each fiscal year. These earnings and distributions, net of any non-controlling interest in these businesses, are available to:\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>meet capital expenditure requirements, management fees and corporate overhead charges;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fund distributions from the businesses to the Company; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>be distributed by the Trust to shareholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> 2018 Highlights and Recent Events\nAcquisition of Foam Fabricators\nOn February 15, 2018, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary FFI Compass, Inc., acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Foam Fabricators, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Foam Fabricators\u201d), for a purchase price of approximately $253.4 million. Foam Fabricators is a leading designer and manufacturer of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components made from expanded polymers such as expanded polystyrene and expanded polypropylene. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, it operates 13 molding and fabricating facilities across North America and provides products to a variety of end-markets, including appliances and\nelectronics, pharmaceuticals, health and wellness, automotive, building products and others. We funded our acquisition of Foam Fabricators with a draw on our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility.\nAcquisition of Rimports\nOn February 26, 2018, our Sterno subsidiary acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Rimports, Inc.,, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated January 23, 2018. Sterno purchased a 100% controlling interest in Rimports. Headquartered in Provo, Utah, Rimports is a manufacturer and distributor of branded and private label scented wickless candle products used for home d\u00e9cor and fragrance. Rimports offers an extensive line of wax warmers, scented wax cubes, essential oils and diffusers, and other home fragrance systems, through the mass retailer channel. The purchase price, net of transaction costs, was approximately $154.4 million, subject to any working capital adjustment. The purchase price of Rimports includes a potential earn-out of up to $25 million contingent on the attainment of certain future performance criteria of Rimports. At December 31, 2018, the earn-out was not expected to be paid. Sterno funded the acquisition through their intercompany credit facility with the Company.\nAcquisition of ESMI\nOn May 23, 2018, Clean Earth acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Environmental Soil Management, Inc.( ESMI\u201d), located in Fort Edward, New York and Loudon, New Hampshire. The acquisition provided Clean Earth the opportunity to geographically expand their soil and hazardous waste solutions in the New York and New England market. The purchase price was approximately $31.0 million.\nAcquisition of Ravin\nOn September 4, 2018, Velocity Outdoor (formerly \"Crosman Corp.\") acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Ravin for a purchase price of approximately $98.0 million, net of transaction costs, plus a potential earn-out of up to $25.0 million based on gross profit levels as of December 31, 2018. Headquartered in Superior, Wisconsin, Ravin Crossbows is a leading designer, manufacturer and innovator of crossbows and accessories. Ravin primarily focuses on the higher-end segment of the crossbow market and has developed significant intellectual property related to the advancement of crossbow technology. The acquisition of Ravin positions Velocity Outdoor to more fully capitalize on the sizeable crossbow market, further diversify its customer base and take advantage of the product and market expertise inside of Ravin.\nTrust Preferred Share Issuance\nOn March 13, 2018, the Trust issued 4,000,000 Series B Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $100.0 million, or $96.5 million net of underwriters' discount and issuance costs. Distributions on the Series B Preferred Shares will be payable quarterly in arrears, when and as declared by the Company's board of directors on January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30 of each year, beginning on July 30, 2018. Distributions on the Series B Preferred Shares are cumulative.\nSenior Notes and 2018 Credit Facility\nOn April 18, 2018, we consummated the issuance and sale of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.000% Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d or \"Senior Notes\") offered pursuant to a private offering. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay debt under our existing credit facilities in connection with a concurrent refinancing of our 2014 Credit Facility. The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 8.000% per annum and will mature on May 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes is payable in cash on May 1st and November 1st of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018. The Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries.\nConcurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2018 Credit Facility\") to amend and restate the 2014 Credit Facility, originally dated as of June 6, 2014 (as previously amended) among the Company, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The 2018 Credit Facility provides for (i) revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit (the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) up to a maximum aggregate amount of $600 million, and (ii) a $500 million term loan (the 2018 Term Loan\u201d). The 2018 Term Loan was issued at an original issuance discount of 99.75%. We used the proceeds from the 2018 Credit Facility and the proceeds from the Notes offering to pay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit agreement and to pay the fees, original issue discount and expenses incurred in connection with the 2018 Credit Facility and Notes.\n2018 Distributions\nCommon shares - For the 2018 fiscal year we declared distributions to our common shareholders totaling $1.44 per share.\nPreferred shares - For the 2018 fiscal year we declared distributions to our preferred shareholders totaling $1.8125 per share on our Series A Preferred Shares and $1.724375 on our Series B Preferred Shares.\nSubsequent Event\nManitoba Harvest\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Tilray, Inc. (\"Tilray\") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tilray, 1197879 B.C. Ltd. ( Tilray Subco\u201d), to sell to Tilray, Inc., through Tilray Subco, all of the issued and outstanding securities of Manitoba Harvest for total consideration of up to C$419 million. Subject to certain customary adjustments, the shareholders of Manitoba Harvest, including the Company, may receive the following from Tilray as consideration for their shares of Manitoba Harvest: (i) C$150 million in cash to the holders of preferred shares of Manitoba Harvest and the holders of common shares of Manitoba Harvest ( Common Holders\u201d) and C$127.5 million in shares of class 2 Common Stock of Tilray ( Common Stock\u201d) to the Common Holders on the closing date of the sale (the Closing Date Consideration\u201d), (ii) C$50 million in cash and C$42.5 million in Common Stock to the Common Holders on the date that is six months after the closing date of the Arrangement (the Deferred Consideration\u201d) and (iii) C$49 million in Common Stock to the Common Holders, which amount may be reduced, potentially to zero, if Manitoba Harvest fails to attain certain levels of U.S. branded gross sales of edible or topical products containing broad spectrum hemp extracts or cannabidiols prior to December 31, 2019. The cash portion of the Closing Date Consideration will be reduced by the amount of the net indebtedness of Manitoba Harvest on the closing date and transaction expenses expected to be approximately $5 million. The Common Stock consideration is expected to be issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and pursuant to exemptions from applicable securities laws of any state of the United States, such that any shares of Common Stock received by the Common Holders will be freely tradeable. The sale of Manitoba Harvest will occur pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Business Operations Act (British Columbia). The completion of the plan of arrangement was subject to approval by the British Columbia Supreme Court, which occurred on February 21, 2019. The sale is expected to close as soon as practicable following receipt of court approval.\n2019 Outlook and Significant Trends\nDuring 2018, the middle market continued to be an active segment for deal flow, with further acceleration of deal flow expected in 2019. High valuation levels continue to be driven by the availability of debt capital with favorable terms and financial and strategic buyers seeking to deploy available equity capital. We believe that companies will focus on expanding their customer bases by diversifying their products and services in existing geographic areas during 2019.\nWe remain focused on marketing the Company's attractive ownership and management attributes to potential sellers of middle market businesses and intermediaries. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for add-on acquisitions by certain of our existing subsidiary companies, which can be particularly attractive from a strategic perspective.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor 2019, we anticipate our niche industrial companies, combined as a whole, will continue to grow revenue and earnings as a result of the overall health of the economy. Our branded consumer companies, combined as a whole, may be impacted in 2019 by the continued weakening in the U.S. retail landscape, specifically, lower consumer foot traffic in brick and mortar retail, and the related shift to more online shopping. We believe our branded consumer companies' combined as a whole, with their strong positions in their respective markets and powerful brands, remain well positioned to grow revenue and earnings in 2019, notwithstanding this difficult landscape.\nThe areas of focus for 2019, which are generally applicable to each of our businesses, include:\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Achieving sales growth through a combination of new product development, increasing distribution and international expansion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Taking market share, where possible, in each of our niche market leading companies, generally at the expense of less well capitalized competitors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Striving for excellence in supply chain management, manufacturing and technological capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continuing to pursue expense reduction and cost savings in lower margin business lines or in response to lower production volume;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continuing to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions and rigorous integration processes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management, enabling continued investment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, and distributions to our shareholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion reflects a comparison of the historical results of operations of our consolidated business for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and components of the results of operations as well as those components presented as a percent of net revenues, for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis.\nWe acquired Foam Fabricators in February 2018, Velocity Outdoor in June 2017, 5.11 in August 2016 and our Sterno business acquired Rimports in February 2018. In the following results of operations, we provide (i) our actual Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, which includes the historical results of operations of each of our businesses (operating segments) from the date of acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and (ii) comparative historical components of the results of operations for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis ( Results of Operations - Our Businesses\u201d), for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, where all years presented include relevant pro-forma adjustments for pre-acquisition periods and explanations where applicable. For the 2018 acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased these businesses on January 1, 2017. The historical operating results of Rimports have been added to the previously reported Sterno results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Sterno results of operations for the 2018 period prior to acquisition by Sterno. For the 2017 acquisition of Velocity Outdoor and the 2016 acquisition of 5.11, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased these businesses on January 1, 2016. We believe this presentation enhances the discussion and provides a more meaningful comparison of operating results. The following operating results of our businesses are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, going forward.\nAll dollar amounts in the financial tables are presented in thousands.

Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $113.4 million and $145.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue, while our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor in June 2017 contributed $52.9 million to the increase, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018. We also saw notable sales increases at Clean\nEarth ($55.7 million), 5.11 ($37.9 million), Manitoba ($11.7 million), Arnold ($12.3 million) and our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports ($9.4 million). These increases in revenue were partially offset by decreases in net revenue at Liberty ($9.3 million) and Ergo ($12.4 million) in 2018 as compared to 2017. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of net revenue by business segment.\nWe do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and, in some cases, dividends on our equity ownership. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated.\nCost of revenues\nOn a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately $295.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $82.6 million and $110.5 million, respectively, to the increase in cost of revenues, while our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor in June 2017 contributed $35.3 million to the increase, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018. Clean Earth's cost of revenue increased $41.4 million, in line with the increase in revenues during 2018, while our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports had an increase in cost of revenues of $9.3 million, Manitoba Harvest ($8.0 million) and Arnold had an increase in cost of revenues of $8.6 million, both in line with the increase in revenues at these entities. These increases were offset by decreases in cost of revenues at other operating segments, particularly Ergo ($3.1 million decrease) and Liberty ($3.3 million decrease).\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 33.9% in year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 35.3% in 2017. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately $74.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase in expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 is principally the result of the acquisition of Foam Fabricators ($12.3 million including $1.6 million in acquisition costs), Rimports ($4.0 million, including $0.6 million in acquisition costs) and Velocity Outdoor ($10.4 million) reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018 and acquisition costs related to Ravin of $1.4 million. We also saw notable increases in selling, general and administrative year-over-year at 5.11 ($22.2 million) and Clean Earth ($10.8 million). Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense increased from $12.7 million in 2017 to $14.3 million in 2018, primarily due to increased professional fees associated with governance and compliance costs related to the implementation of new accounting standards.\nFees to manager\nPursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred approximately $44.3 million in expense for these fees compared to $32.7 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The $11.6 million increase in the year ended December 31, 2018 is principally due to the increase in consolidated net assets resulting from the acquisition of Foam Fabricators in February 2018, and the add-on acquisitions by our businesses that occurred throughout 2018.\nAmortization expense\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $16.1 million to $68.1 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018.\nImpairment expense\nManitoba Harvest performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and its indefinite lived trade name in the fourth quarter of 2017, which resulted in the recording of impairment expense of $8.5 million. $6.2 million of the impairment expense related to goodwill, and $2.3 million of the impairment expense related to the Manitoba Harvest trade name.\nInterest Expense\nWe recorded interest expense totaling $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $27.6 million for the comparable period in 2017, an increase of $28.0 million. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects the interest associated with the issuance of our Senior Notes in April 2018 and the increase in the amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility in the current year. We recorded $22.5 million in interest expense for the period from the date of issuance through December 31, 2018 related to the Senior Notes. The average amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility in 2017 was $33.6 million, while the average amount outstanding during 2018 was $205.1 million as a result of our add-on acquisitions that occurred in 2018. Our interest expense also reflects the effect of the unrealized gains or losses on our interest rate swap. In 2018 and 2017, we recognized unrealized gains of $2.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, which reduced our interest expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had income tax expense of $6.5 million with an effective income tax rate of 187.1% during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to income tax benefit of $40.7 million with an effective income tax rate of (549.2%) during the same period in 2017. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 includes a loss at our parent company, which is taxed as a partnership. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") which made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. Among other changes of the Tax Act, the tax rate on corporations was reduced from from 35% to 21%; a limitation on the deduction of interest expense was enacted, certain tangible property acquired after September 2017 will qualify for 100% expensing, U.S federal income tax on foreign earnings was eliminated (subject to certain exceptions) and a new base erosion anti-tax abuse tax were added. Although the Company is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each of our businesses was affected by the Tax Act, and the resulting impact significantly affected the calculation of our year-to-date consolidated income tax provision in 2018 and 2017. Additionally, in the current year, the effect of the recapitalization at Sterno and state income taxes as well as the geographic mix of income had a significant impact on our effective tax rate. In the prior year, the impairment expense at our Arnold business and non-deductible costs at the corporate level, including the effect of the loss on our equity investment of FOX prior to the sale of our remaining FOX shares in the first quarter of 2017, account for the majority of the remaining difference in our effective income tax rates year over year.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet revenues\nOn a consolidated basis, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by approximately $291.4 million or 29.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Velocity Outdoor sales since the date of acquisition were $78.4 million, while $200.0 million of the increase reflects a full year of net sales at 5.11 in 2017 as compared to 2016. We also saw notable sales increases at Clean Earth ($22.3 million, primarily due to two acquisitions in 2016 and one acquisition in 2017) and Sterno ($7.3 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Sterno Home in January 2016), offset by decreases in sales at Liberty ($11.9 million) and Manitoba Harvest ($3.6 million) in 2017 as compared to 2016. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of net revenues by business segment.\nWe do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and, in some cases, dividends on our equity ownership. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated.\nCost of revenues\nOn a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately $170.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Velocity cost of sales since the date of acquisition were $61.7 million, while 5.11 Tactical accounted for $103.5 million of the increase, reflecting a full year of ownership in 2017. The remaining amount of the increase was primarily due to add-on acquisitions made during 2016 at Clean Earth, Sterno and Ergobaby. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 35.3% in year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 33.4% in 2016. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately $100.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. The increase in expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 is principally the result of the acquisition of Velocity in June 2017 ($12.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, including $1.8 million in acquisition costs for Velocity and the add-on acquisition of Lasermax in July 2017), and a full year of ownership of 5.11 ($125.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2017 compared to $38.1 million in 2016). Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense increased from $12.3 million in 2016 to $12.7 million in 2017, primarily due to increased professional fees associated with compliance costs.\nFees to manager\nPursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred approximately $32.7 million in expense for these fees compared to $29.4 million for the corresponding period in 2016. The $3.3 million increase in the year ended December 31, 2017 is principally due to the increase in consolidated net assets resulting from the acquisition of Velocity in June 2017, 5.11 in August 2016, and the add-on acquisitions by our businesses that occurred throughout 2016.\nAmortization expense\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $16.9 million to $52.0 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Velocity in June 2017 and 5.11 in August 2016.\nImpairment expense and Loss on disposal of assets\nManitoba Harvest performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and its indefinite lived trade name in the fourth quarter of 2017, which resulted in the recording of preliminary impairment expense of $8.5 million. $6.2 million of the impairment expense related to goodwill, and $2.3 million of the impairment expense related to the Manitoba Harvest trade name.\nArnold performed an interim impairment test at each of its reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in the recording of preliminary impairment expense of the PMAG reporting unit of $16.0 million as of December 31, 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, Arnold completed the impairment testing of the PMAG reporting unit and recorded an additional $8.9 million impairment expense based on the results of the Step 2 impairment testing.\nInterest expense\nWe recorded interest expense totaling $27.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.0 million compared to the prior year. The increase was a result of a full year of interest on our 2016 Incremental Term Loan, which we entered into in August 2016, as well as an increase in the unused fee we pay on our Revolving Credit Facility. The average amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility in 2017 was $29.1 million, while the average outstanding amount in 2016 was $27.4 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $40.7 million with an effective tax rate of (549.2%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $9.5 million of income tax expense with an effective tax rate of 15% for the year ended December 31, 2016. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation which made broad changes to the U.S. tax code, including a reduction in the tax rate on corporations from 35% to 21%, a limitation on the deduction of interest expense, U.S. federal income taxes on foreign earnings was eliminated (subject to several exceptions) and new provisions designed to tax currently global intangible low taxed income and a new base erosion anti-abuse tax were added. Although the Trust and the Company are treated as partnerships for U.S. income tax purposes and are therefore not subject to net income taxes, we consolidate the results of the businesses in which we own or control more than a 50% share of the voting interest. The income tax benefit in 2017 reflects the accounting for the effect of the changes resulting from the new tax legislation at our consolidated subsidiaries.\nResults of Operations - Our Businesses\nWe categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups of businesses (i) branded consumer businesses, and (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are characterized as those businesses that we believe\ncapitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular category. Niche industrial businesses are characterized as those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling particular products or services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sector.\nBranded Consumer Businesses\n5.11\nOverview\n5.11 is a leading provider of purpose-built tactical apparel and gear for law enforcement, firefighters, EMS, and military special operations as well as outdoor and adventure enthusiasts. 5.11 is a brand known for innovation and authenticity, and works directly with end users to create purpose-built apparel and gear designed to enhance the safety, accuracy, speed and performance of tactical professionals and enthusiasts worldwide. 5.11 operates sales offices and distribution centers globally, and 5.11 products are widely distributed in uniform stores, military exchanges, outdoor retail stores, its own retail stores and on 511tactical.com.\nResults of Operations\nIn the following results of operations, we provide (i) the actual consolidated results of operations for 5.11 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and (ii) comparative results of operations for 5.11 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as if we had acquired the business on January 1, 2016, including relevant pro forma adjustments for the pre-acquisition period and explanations where applicable.\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Pro forma)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,852\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPro forma results of operations for 5.11 for the annual period ended December 31, 2016 include the following pro forma adjustments applied to historical results:\n(1) Gross profit was increased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to reflect the increase in the depreciable lives for machinery and equipment.\n(2) Selling, general and administrative expense was increased by approximately $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to stock compensation expense for stock options that were granted to 5.11 employees as a result of the acquisition.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $347.9 million, an increase of $37.9 million, or 12.2%, compared to the same period in 2017. This increase is due primarily to retail and e-commerce sales growth of $25.4 million or 51%, driven by growing demand in direct to consumer channels. Retail sales grew largely due to eighteen new retail store openings since December 2017 (bringing the total store count to forty-five as of December 31, 2018). The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was offset by a $17.6 million decline in Direct-to-Agency sales. Direct-to-agency sales represent large contracts consisting primarily of SMU (special make-up) custom uniform product designed for large law enforcement divisions. The Direct-to-agency contract process is driven primarily by lengthy governmental approval processes and can take upwards of 18 to 36 months, therefore revenue streams are not consistent year-over-year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.2% in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 46.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $21.7 million in expense related to a $39.1 million inventory step-up resulting from the acquisition purchase price allocation. The total inventory\nstep-up amount of $39.1 million was expensed to cost of goods sold over the expected turns of 5.11's inventory. Excluding the effect of the expense associated with the inventory step-up in 2017, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 48.2%. The decrease in gross profit percentage in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a higher level of chargebacks incurred and discretionary discounts granted to customers while working through the backlog associated with challenges experienced while implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $147.1 million or 42.3% of net sales compared to $125.0 million or 40.3% of net sales in the same period in 2017. This increase in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to eighteen new retail stores that were not open in the prior comparable period, higher temporary labor costs associated with the ERP implementation, higher software maintenance costs related to the ERP system and costs to move into 5.11's new Manteca warehouse facility, which occurred in the second quarter of 2018.\nIncome (loss) from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.9 million, an increase of $11.0 million when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the amortization of the inventory step-up resulting from the purchase price allocation and the increase in selling, general and administrative expense as noted above.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Pro Forma Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $310.0 million, an increase of $14.7 million, or 5.0%, compared to the same period in 2016. This increase is due primarily to an $8.2 million increase in international direct-to-agency business, and increased retail and e-commerce sales. Direct-to-agency sales represent large non-recurring contracts consisting primarily of SMU (special make-up) custom uniform product designed for large law enforcement divisions. Retail and e-commerce sales grew $16.3 million, or 50%, driven by growing demand in direct to consumer channels. Retail sales grew largely due to seventeen new retail store openings in 2017 (bringing the total store count to 27 as of December 31, 2017). The consumer wholesale channel experienced a $4.6 million decrease due primarily to the bankruptcy of a large outdoor retail customer. 5.11 implemented a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and as part of the go-live process 5.11 shut down its warehouse as planned on September 28, 2017 to begin the cut-over activities. Upon reopening the warehouse on October 9, 2017, 5.11 encountered shipping challenges due to the ERP system not functioning as designed. This resulted in lost orders and an order backlog that reached over $20.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 38.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016 to 41.2% in the year ended December 31, 2017. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $21.7 million in expense related to a $39.1 million inventory step-up resulting from the acquisition purchase price allocation, while cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $17.4 million in expense related to the purchase price allocation. The total inventory step-up amount of $39.1 million was expensed to cost of goods sold over the expected turns of 5.11's inventory. Excluding the effect of the expense associated with the inventory step-up in both periods, gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 420 basis points to 48.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 44.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in gross profit percentage is due to lower product costs from efficiency in sourcing operations, improved gross margins on new product introductions, and a larger proportion of revenues from the higher margin retail and e-commerce distribution channels as compared to the same period in 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $125.0 million or 40.3% of net sales compared to $107.1 million or 36.3% of net sales in the same period in 2016. This increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to seventeen new retail stores that were not open in the prior comparable period, strategic investments into sales and marketing, and integration service fees billed by CGM to 5.11 ($1.2 million in 2016 compared to $2.3 million in 2017).\nLoss from operations\nLoss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7.1 million, a decrease of $3.3 million when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the amortization of the inventory step-up resulting from the purchase price allocation, as well as the other factors noted above.\nErgobaby\nOverview\nErgobaby, headquartered in Los Angeles, California, is a designer, marketer and distributor of wearable baby carriers and accessories, blankets and swaddlers, nursing pillows, and related products.

Net sales from Baby Tula for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $19.4 million, compared to $22.4 million in net sales in the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, international sales were approximately $58.0 million, representing a decrease of $4.6 million over the corresponding period in 2017. Baby Tula international sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $1.0 million from the corresponding period in 2017. Domestic sales were $32.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting a decrease of $7.8 million compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease in domestic sales was primarily the result of the disruption in the retail landscape during 2018, including the continuing effect of the liquidation of a large U.S. retail customer.\nCost of sales\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 65.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 67.0% for the same period in 2017. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to changes in product mix and increased production costs as a result of the launch of a new stroller product.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to approximately $40.2 million or 44.4% of net sales compared to $33.4 million or 32.4% of net sales for the same period of 2017. Selling, general and administrative expense in the prior year included the reversal of the fair value of the contingent consideration related to Ergobaby's acquisition of Baby Tula of $3.8 million. Eliminating the effect of the contingent consideration, the increase in Ergobaby's selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to increases in employee related costs, additional marketing for the new stroller product category launch, additional expense related to the closure of a large retail account, higher distribution and fulfillment costs, commissions due to the mix of sales, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $13.0 million, to $11.5 million, compared to $24.5 million for the same period of 2017, primarily as a result of the factors described above.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $103.0 million, a decrease of $0.4 million or 0.4% compared to the same period in 2016. Net sales from Baby Tula for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $22.4 million, compared to $16.3 million in sales in the post-May acquisition period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, international sales were approximately $62.6 million, representing an increase of $5.2 million over the corresponding period in 2016. International sales of baby carriers and accessories increased by approximately $7.2 million and international sales of infant travel systems decreased by approximately $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the comparable period in 2016. Baby Tula international sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $3.3 million from the corresponding period in 2016. Domestic sales were $40.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting a decrease of $6.4 million compared to the corresponding period in 2016. The decrease in domestic sales is attributable to a $6.1 million decrease in domestic infant travel systems and accessories sales, a $2.1 million decrease in sales of Ergo branded baby carrier and accessories to national and specialty retail accounts, partially offset by a $1.8 million increase in Baby Tula domestic sales. The decrease in baby carrier and accessories sales was attributable to the overall weakness in the U.S. retail market during 2017, as well as the bankruptcy of a large national retailer. The decrease in infant travel systems and accessories sales was primarily attributable to exiting the Orbit Baby business during 2016. Baby carriers, sleep products and accessories represented 100% of sales in 2017 compared to 93% in 2016.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 67.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 61.3% for the same period in 2016. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 included expense of $4.7 million related to the inventory step-up at Baby Tula resulting from the purchase price allocation. Excluding the step-up in inventory at Baby Tula 2016, gross margin would have been 66.0% in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to approximately $33.4 million or 32.4% of net sales compared to $37.7 million or 36.5% of net sales for the same period of 2016. The $4.3 million decrease in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily attributable to the reversal of the fair value of the contingent consideration related to Ergobaby's acquisition of Baby Tula. The contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Baby Tula had a fair value of $3.8 million and was reversed as of December 31, 2017, when the metrics related to the earnout were not met. The decrease in expense was also due to lower professional fees and marketing expenses, due to the timing of marketing spend, and to lower acquisition costs, related to the 2016 Baby Tula acquisition.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $7.4 million, to $24.5 million, compared to $17.2 million for the same period of 2016, primarily as a result of a $5.9 million loss on disposal of assets recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to its decision to dispose of the Orbit Baby product line.\nLiberty Safe\nOverview\nFounded in 1988 and based in Payson, Utah, Liberty Safe is the premier designer, manufacturer and marketer of home and gun safes in North America.

Non-Dealer sales were approximately $32.9 million in 2018 compared to $42.3 million in 2017, representing a decrease of $9.4 million or 22.2%. Dealer sales totaled approximately $49.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $49.5 million in the same period in 2017, representing an increase of $0.2 million or 0.4%. Liberty continues to face negative trends in the U.S. outdoor retail market, including the bankruptcy filing by a national retailer in the prior year, slower ordering and reductions of inventory levels as a result of the merger of two major outdoor retailers and softer sales at retailers dealing in sporting goods. Liberty Safe's sales backlog was approximately $6.0 million at December 31, 2018 compared to approximately $6.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales totaled approximately 23.8% in 2018 compared to 27.9% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 is attributable primarily to cost increases in raw materials. Liberty has continued to see a rise in raw material costs, particularly the cost of steel, during 2018 as the tariffs on imported steel has led to rising domestic steel prices. On average, materials account for approximately 60% of the total costs of a safe, with steel accounting for 45% of material costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to approximately $13.2 million or 15.9% of net sales compared to $15.4 million or 16.7% of net sales for the same period of 2017. The $2.2 million decrease is primarily attributable to a nonrecurring $1.9 million reserve recorded in the first quarter of 2017 against the outstanding accounts receivable of a retail customer that filed for bankruptcy.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations decreased $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.9 million compared to income from operations of $9.5 million during the same period in 2017, principally as a result of the decrease in sales and gross profit in 2018, as described above.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $11.9 million or 11.4%, to $92.0 million, compared to the corresponding period ended December 31, 2016. Non-Dealer sales were approximately $42.3 million in 2017 compared to $52.5 million in 2016, representing a decrease of $10.2 million or 19.4%. Dealer sales totaled approximately $49.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $51.3 million in the same period in 2016, representing a decrease of $1.8 million or 3.5%. The decrease in sales is attributable to lower overall market demand during the current year as compared to 2016, when uncertainty surrounding the 2016 domestic elections and regulatory environment led to an increased level of demand for safes. The Non-Dealer channel also saw a decrease in sales due to the bankruptcy of a large outdoor retailer in the first quarter of 2017. Liberty Safe's sales backlog was approximately $6.2 million at December 31, 2017 compared to approximately $8.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales totaled approximately 27.9% in 2017 compared to 28.4% in 2016. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 is attributable primarily to higher material costs related to the cost of steel, which is Liberty's primary raw material, partially offset by gains in manufacturing efficiencies.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to approximately $15.4 million or 16.7% of net sales compared to $14.7 million or 14.2% of net sales for the same period of 2016. The $0.6 million increase is primarily attributable to a $1.9 million reserve established against the outstanding accounts receivable of a retail customer that filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2017, offset by a reduction in administrative expenses.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations decreased $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $9.5 million compared to income from operations of $13.2 million during the same period in 2016, principally as a result of the decrease in sales and gross profit in 2017, as described above.\nManitoba Harvest\nOverview\nHeadquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Manitoba Harvest is a pioneer and leader in branded, hemp-based foods and ingredients. Manitoba Harvest's products, which management believes are one of the fastest growing in the hemp food market and among the fastest growing in the natural foods industry, are currently carried in approximately 16,500 retail stores across the United States and Canada. The company's hemp-based, 100% all-natural consumer products include hemp hearts, protein powder, hemp oil and snacks.\nResults of Operations\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,754\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(16.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $67.4 million, an increase of $11.7 million, or 21.1%, compared to the same period in 2017. During 2018, Manitoba Harvest experienced strong growth across both the branded and ingredient product lines. Consumer awareness programs, new distribution gains, and consumer demand for plant-based protein continue to drive sales of their shelled hemp seed and hemp oil products.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ending December 31, 2018 was $28.9 million, an increase of $3.8 million compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 45.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the current year was primarily driven by protein powder work in process inventory adjustments, incremental third party warehousing to support customer service and consumer demand, and costs related to the realignment of logistics between our Winnipeg and St. Agathe facilities.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to approximately $25.7 million or 38.2% of net sales compared to $21.1 million or 37.9% of net sales for the same period of 2017. The $4.6\nmillion increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to ongoing investments in key operating capability initiatives such as creative production, digital media, public relations, creative production, field sales and research and development.\nLoss from operations\nLoss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $1.8 million, as compared to a loss from operations of $9.3 million for the same period in 2017. Manitoba Harvest performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and its indefinite lived trade name in the fourth quarter of 2017, which resulted in the recording of impairment expense of $8.5 million. Approximately $6.2 million of the impairment expense related to goodwill, and $2.3 million of the impairment expense related to the Manitoba Harvest trade name. While Manitoba Harvest saw a significant increase in net sales and gross profit compared to the prior year, the ongoing investment in their business has led to an offsetting increase in selling, general and administrative expense in the current year, resulting in the loss from operations.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $55.7 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 6.1%, compared to the same period in 2016. Manitoba Harvest experienced declines in bulk hemp seed ingredient sales to international markets in the current year, which was partially offset by growth in their Canadian retail, U.S. club and online businesses, driven by sales of branded hemp heart products and hemp oil.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 45.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the decrease in sales of ingredients, which have historically had lower margins than the branded Manitoba Harvest products. Gross profit margins in our branded business increased due to improving product mix and lower material costs. Gross profit margins in our ingredient business declined due to a more competitive pricing environment and less fixed cost leverage.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to approximately $21.1 million or 37.9% of net sales compared to $21.3 million or 35.9% of net sales for the same period of 2016. The $0.2 million decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to lower customer shipping costs, and more efficient field selling operations.\nIncome (loss) from operations\nLoss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $9.3 million, as compared to income of $0.3 million for the same period in 2016. Manitoba Harvest performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and its indefinite lived trade name in the fourth quarter of 2017, which resulted in the recording of impairment expense of $8.5 million. $6.2 million of the impairment expense related to goodwill, and $2.3 million of the impairment expense related to the Manitoba Harvest trade name. The impairment expense recognized in 2017 was the primary factor contributing to the loss from operations.\nVelocity Outdoor\nOverview\nVelocity Outdoor is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of airguns, archery products, laser aiming devices and related accessories.

The increase in net sales is primarily a result of increased demand across various product sectors and markets. PMAG sales represented 74% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 and 72% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2017. International sales were $47.8 million and $42.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $5.5 million, primarily as a result of the increased sales at PMAG.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $26.7 million for the same period in 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 25.3% in 2017 to 25.8% in 2018. The increase is principally attributable to an increase in sales volume and manufacturing efficiencies.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $19.0 million as compared to approximately $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in expense is primarily attributable to non-recurring legal and environmental expenses and reduced consulting fees. Selling, general and administrative expense represented 16.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 18.5% for the same period in 2017.\nIncome (loss) from operations\nArnold had income from operations of approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to a loss from operations of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, with the loss in the prior year primarily as a result of the impairment expense.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $105.6 million, a decrease of $2.6 million compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in net sales is primarily a result of decreases in the PMAG ($2.1 million), and Flexmag ($1.5 million) product sectors. PMAG sales represented 72% of net sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in PMAG sales is mainly attributable to lower sales of reprographic products. The decrease in Flexmag sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 is largely due to decreased customer demand. International sales were $42.3 million and $42.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 21.9% in 2016 to 25.3% in 2017 despite lower sales. The increase is principally attributable to an increase in Precision Thin Metals margins partially offset by the impact of PMAG volume reductions. Flexmag margin in 2017 was consistent with 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $19.6 million as compared to approximately $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in expense is primarily attributable to a one-time increase in legal, professional and environmental fees.\nImpairment expense\nArnold performed an interim impairment test at each of its reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in the recording of preliminary impairment expense of the PMAG reporting unit of $16.0 million. In the first quarter of 2017, Arnold completed the impairment testing of the PMAG reporting unit and recorded an additional $8.9 million impairment expense based on the results of the Step 2 impairment testing.\nLoss from operations\nArnold had a loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $5.7 million, as compared to a loss from operations of $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, with the loss in both years primarily as a result of the impairment expense.\nClean Earth\nOverview\nFounded in 1990, Clean Earth is a provider of environmental services for a variety of contaminated materials. Clean Earth provides a one-stop shop solution that analyzes, treats, documents and recycles waste streams generated in multiple end-markets such as utilities, infrastructure, chemicals, aerospace and defense, non-public/ private development, medical, industrial and dredging. Historically, the majority of Clean Earth's revenues have been generated by contaminated soils, which includes environmentally impacted soils and other materials which are treated at one of its eleven permitted soil treatment facilities. Clean Earth also operates six RCRA Part B hazardous waste facilities, and a water waste treatment facility. The remaining revenue has been generated by dredge material, which consists of sediment removed from the floor of a body of water for navigational purposes and/or environmental remediation of contaminated waterways and is treated at one of its two permitted dredge processing facilities. Approximately 98% of the material processed by Clean Earth is beneficially reused for such purposes as infrastructure projects, daily landfill cover, industrial and brownfield redevelopment projects.\nResults of Operations\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet revenues\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $266.9 million, an increase of $55.7 million or 26.4% compared to the same period in 2017. Contaminated soil revenue increased 20% as compared to the same period last year, which is principally attributable to large project awards and the impact of recent acquisitions. Hazardous waste revenue increased 21% in the current year as compared to the prior year as a result of recent acquisitions and growth in the base business. Net revenues from dredge increased $14.3 million in 2018 as compared to the prior year, due to the timing of projects. Contaminated soils represented approximately 53% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 55% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGross profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $75.5 million compared to approximately $61.2 million in the same period of 2017, an increase of $14.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in the gross profit at each of Clean Earths' service lines. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased from 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 28.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is due to increased back-end costs for certain soil facilities.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to approximately $46.7 million or 17.5% of net revenues compared to $35.9 million or 17.0% of net revenues for the same period in 2017. The $10.8 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily attributable to Clean Earth's recent acquisitions.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $14.4 million as compared to income from operations of $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.4 million, primarily as a result of those factors described above.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet revenues\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $211.2 million, an increase of $22.3 million or 11.8% compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in service revenues is principally due to two acquisitions in 2016 and one in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, contaminated soil volumes increased 11% as compared to the same period last year principally attributable to commercial development activity in the New York City area, and the acquisition of Phoenix Soil in April 2016. Revenue from dredged material decreased during 2017 as compared to 2016 due to the timing and flow of new maintenance contracts in our core markets. Contaminated soils represented approximately 55% of net revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nGross profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $61.2 million compared to approximately $54.3 million in the same period of 2017, an increase of $6.9 million, primarily as a result of the two acquisitions in 2016 and one acquisition in 2017.

The historical results of Foam Fabricators for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from January 1, 2018 through February 15, 2018 have been adjusted to reflect the purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the acquisition. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $1.0 million in stock compensation expense, $0.2 million reduction in depreciation expense and $8.0 million in amortization expense, as well as $0.8 million in management fees that would have been incurred by Foam Fabricators if we owned the company during this period. The historical results of Foam Fabricators for the period from January 1, 2018 through February 15, 2018 have been adjusted to reflect $0.2 million in stock compensation expense, $0.1 million in depreciation expense, and $1.0 million in amortization expense, as well as $0.1 million in management fees that would have been incurred by Foam Fabricators if we owned the company during this period.\nPro Forma Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Pro Forma Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $128.5 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net sales was due to organic growth with the existing customer base, primarily related to the appliance and other packaging categories.\nGross profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 27.1% and 30.8%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $0.7 million related to the inventory step-up resulting from the acquisition purchase price allocation. Excluding the effect of the inventory step-up, the gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 27.6%, a decrease of 320 basis points compared to the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to due to increased raw material costs and, to a lesser degree, increased compensation, benefits and other plant expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $14.0 million as compared to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.3 million. Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $2.0 million in integration service fees paid to CGM and $1.5 million in transaction costs paid in relation to the acquisition of Foam Fabricators. Excluding the integration fees and transaction costs, selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.2 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year due to lower management bonus expenses and nonrecurring expenses related to the compensation of the previous owner.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $5.3 million based on the factors noted above.\nSterno\nOverview\nSterno is a manufacturer and marketer of portable food warming fuel and creative ambience solutions for the hospitality and consumer markets.

The historical results of Sterno for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from January 1, 2018 through February 28, 2018 have been adjusted to reflect the purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the acquisition. In the year ended December 31, 2017, $0.1 million reduction in depreciation expense and $9.6 million in amortization expense. The historical results of Sterno for the period from January 1, 2018 through February 15, 2018 have been adjusted to reflect $0.1 million in depreciation expense, and $1.6 million in amortization expense.\nPro Forma Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Pro Forma Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $405.9 million, an increase of $22.5 million or 5.9% compared to the same period in 2017. The net sales variance reflects increased Rimports sales relating to harvest promotions, scented wax products and essential oils, as well as stronger Sterno Home candle and outdoor sales.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 25.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 24.0% for the same period ended December 31, 2018. Sterno recognized $4.6 million in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2018 and $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2018 related to the amortization of the inventory step-up resulting from the purchase price allocation of the Rimports acquisition. After eliminating the effect of the inventory step-up, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in gross profit percentage during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflects an increase in chemical and other material costs, as well as higher freight and carrier costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $37.1 million as compared to $37.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.8 million or 2.0%. Selling, general and administrative expense represented 9.1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 9.9% of net sales for the same period in 2017. The decrease as a percentage of net sales in 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 reflects the reversal of the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Rimports of $4.8 million, the increase in sales during the current period, and lower marketing costs, commissions, and development expense.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $42.5 million, a decrease of $1.3 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to the increased costs associated with the Rimports acquisition, including the inventory step-up expense noted above.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $226.1 million, an increase of $7.3 million or 3.3% compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in net sales is a result of the acquisition of Sterno Home in January 2016, partially offset by sales shortfall at Sterno Home's candle division due to reduced demand and non-repeating orders. Sterno Home had net sales of $9.0 million in the period prior to acquisition in January 2016.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 24.7% for the same period ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in gross margin during 2017 primarily reflects an increase in chemical material costs, and a reclassification of certain expenses at Sterno Home from selling, general and administrative expense to cost of goods sold. The reclassification was approximately $3.2 million and was made to align costs related to quality assurance and engineering with the classification used by Sterno Products.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $28.7 million as compared to $34.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $5.7 million or 16.6%. Selling, general and administrative expense represented 12.7% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 15.7% of net sales for the same period in 2016. The decrease as a percentage of net sales in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 reflects the increase in sales during the period and Sterno Home reorganization efforts to reduce staff, as well as the reclassification of certain expenses related to Sterno Home from selling, general and administrative expense to cost of goods sold. The reclassification was approximately $3.2 million and was made to align costs related to quality assurance and engineering with the classification used by Sterno Products. Sterno also recognized a reversal of the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Sterno Home $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $19.2 million, a decrease of $0.4 million when compared to the same period in 2016, due primarily to the increase in material costs in 2017 as described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows:\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(604,080\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(363,021\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>500,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,588\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>2,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,792\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents an increase of $32.7 million compared to cash flow from operating activities of $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash used in operating activities for working capital for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $6.3 million as compared to cash used for working capital of $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our working capital cash flows in the current year reflect a significant decrease in the cash flows from accounts receivable as well as a significant increase in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to the prior year, resulting in an overall decrease in the cash used for working capital. This decrease mostly reflects timing of collections and payments in the current year.\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a decrease of $29.6 million compared to cash flow from operating activities of $111.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash used in operating activities for working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $40.4 million as compared to cash provided by working capital of $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to cash used for inventory by our branded consumer businesses during 2017, as well as a full year of operations at 5.11 (acquired in August 2016) and the acquisition of Velocity in June 2017. The change in cash used to purchase inventory in 2017 was approximately $31.1 million as compared to the prior year, with $29.8 million of the variance related to the branded consumer businesses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities (from both continuing and discontinued operations) totaled approximately $111.4 million, which represents a $26.8 million increase compared to cash flow from operating activities of $84.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by discontinued operations totaled $3.7 million in 2016 as compared to $15.5 million in 2015, with the decrease due to the number of dispositions reflected in each year as well as the timing of the dispositions. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of $38.7 million, which is principally the result of higher net income in 2016 and changes in cash provided by working capital in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 (an increase of $13.2 million), as a result of the acquisitions completed during 2016.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $604.1 million, compared to $77.3 million used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $526.8 million. In the current year, we had a platform acquisition in the first quarter, Foam Fabricators, and several add-on acquisitions at our subsidiaries. Sterno acquired Rimports in February 2018, Clean Earth has had several add-on acquisitions throughout the year, and our Velocity Outdoor subsidiary acquired Ravin in September 2018. The total total cash paid for these current year acquisitions was $552.1 million, while in the prior year, we spent approximately $165.0 million related to our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor and two smaller add-on acquisitions. Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $5.5 million, due primarily to expenditures at our 5.11 business related to investments in various infrastructure\nand systems projects to position them for future growth. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be approximately $45 million to $55 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $77.3 million, compared to $363.0 million used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $285.7 million. During 2016, we completed our acquisition of 5.11 in August, and several add-on acquisitions including the acquisition of Baby Tula by Ergobaby and Sterno Home by Sterno for a total of $536.2 million in cash investment, while in 2017, our total cash paid for acquisitions of $165.0 million related to our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor and two smaller add-on acquisitions. Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $20.8 million, due primarily to expenditures at our 5.11 business related to investments in various infrastructure and systems projects to position them for future growth. The cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures was offset in both years by proceeds from the sale of our investment in FOX, $136.1 million in 2017 and $182.5 million in 2016, as well as the sale of our Tridien business in 2016. The sale of our FOX shares in 2017 represented our remaining investment in FOX.\nCash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled approximately $363.0 million, compared to $233.9 million provided by investing activities in the same period of 2015. The 2016 investing activities primarily reflect the acquisition of 5.11 in the third quarter and the add-on acquisition of Sterno Home, Baby Tula, Phoenix Soil and EWS ($536.2 million) and net proceeds from the sale of Tridien in September 2016 ($11.2 million in net proceeds). Capital expenditures from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2016 increased approximately $8.3 million, from $15.7 million in 2015 to $24.0 million in 2016. The increase in capital expenditures is attributable to our acquisition of 5.11 in August 2016, and additional investment in Sterno, Advanced Circuits and Liberty during 2016 compared to the prior year. The 2016 investing activities also reflect proceeds from the sale of FOX shares during the year of $182.5 million.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled approximately $500.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our financing cash flows in 2018 primarily related to the financing of our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018, which were financed through draws on our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by net proceeds of $96.5 million from the Series B Preferred Shares offering in March 2018 which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding amount on the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. In April 2018, we issued $400 million in Senior Notes and amended our credit facility. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were used to pay down outstanding amounts under our credit facility. Concurrently with the issuance of our Senior Notes, we refinanced our 2014 Credit Facility and reduced the amount outstanding on our term loan from $558.6 million to $500 million. In addition to activity on our credit facility, financing activities reflect the payment of our quarterly common share distributions ($86.3 million in 2018 and 2017) and preferred share distributions ($12.2 million in 2018 and $2.5 million in 2017).\nCash flows used in financing activities totaled approximately $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $208.7 million. Our financing cash flows in 2017 principally reflect the following:\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The payments of our shareholder distributions of $86.3 million related to our common shares and $2.5 million related to our Series A Preferred Shares;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distributions of $39.2 million paid during 2017 to Holders of the allocation interest related to the sale of our FOX shares;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Proceeds of $96.4 million from a preferred stock offering completed in June 2017;

A component of our acquisition financing strategy that we utilize in acquiring the businesses we own and manage is to provide both equity capital and debt capital, raised at the parent level through our existing credit facility. Our strategy of providing intercompany debt financing within the capital structure of the businesses that we acquire and manage allows us the ability to distribute cash to the parent company through monthly interest payments and amortization of the principle on these intercompany loans. Each loan to our businesses has a scheduled maturity and each business is entitled to repay all or a portion of the principal amount of the outstanding loans, without penalty, prior to maturity. Certain of our businesses have paid down their respective intercompany debt balances through the cash flow generated by these businesses and we have recapitalized, and expect to continue to recapitalize, these businesses in the normal course of our business. The recapitalization process involves funding the intercompany debt using either cash on hand at the parent or our revolving credit facility, and serves the purpose of optimizing the capital structure at our subsidiaries and providing the noncontrolling shareholders with a distribution on their ownership interest in a cash flow positive business.\nIn January 2018, the Company completed a recapitalization at Sterno whereby the Company entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with Sterno (the \"Sterno Loan Agreement\"). The Sterno Loan Agreement was amended to (i) provide for term loan borrowings of $56.8 million to fund a distribution to the Company,\nwhich owned 100% of the outstanding equity of Sterno at the time of the recapitalization, and (ii) extend the maturity dates of the term loans. In connection with the recapitalization, Sterno's management team exercised all of their vested stock options, which represented 58,000 shares of Sterno. The Company then used a portion of the distribution to repurchase the 58,000 shares from management for a total purchase price of $6.0 million. In addition, Sterno issued new stock options to replace the exercised options, thus maintaining the same percentage of fully diluted non-controlling interest that existed prior to the recapitalization. In February 2018, Sterno completed the acquisition of Rimports (refer to \"Note C - Acquisition of Businesses\" for a description of the transaction) for a purchase price of approximately $145 million. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of Rimports, we amended the Sterno Loan Agreement to provide for the advance of additional term loans in the aggregate amount of $136 million, and revolving loans in the amount of $10 million.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we amended the credit facility with Arnold whereby the maturity date of the Term A loan was extended to February 2024, the maturity date of the Term B loan was extended to February 2025, and the financial covenants were updated to reflect changes in the company subsequent to acquisition in March 2012. Additionally, due to significant capital expenditures related to the implementation of a new ERP system, warehouse expansion and retail roll out, we have granted 5.11 waivers under their intercompany debt agreement effective as of the quarter ended September 30, 2017 through December 31, 2018. The waivers permit 5.11 to increase its allowable capital expenditure limits and exclude certain capital expenditures associated with the ERP system and warehouse expansion from the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio. We further amended the 5.11 intercompany debt agreement during 2018 to allow for an additional $5.0 million outstanding debt to be permitted under 5.11's Term B loan. Manitoba Harvest was not in compliance with the financial covenants under their intercompany loan agreement at December 31, 2017, and we amended the Manitoba Harvest intercompany debt agreement to grant a waiver to them through the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2018, we amended the Sterno Loan Agreement to increase the amount available to Sterno under their intercompany revolving credit facility. Liberty was not in compliance with the financial covenants under their intercompany loan agreement at December 31, 2018, and we amended the Liberty intercompany debt agreement to grant a waiver to them through the quarter ended December 31, 2019. Clean Earth was not in compliance with the financial covenants under their intercompany loan agreement at December 31, 2018 as a result of financing various add-on acquisitions during the year, and we amended the Clean Earth intercompany debt agreement to grant a waiver to them through the quarter ended December 31, 2019. Except as previously noted, all of our subsidiaries were in compliance with the financial covenants included within their intercompany credit arrangements at December 31, 2018.\nOur primary source of cash is from the receipt of interest and principal on our outstanding loans to our businesses. Accordingly, we are dependent upon the earnings and cash flow of these businesses, which are available for (i) operating expenses; (ii) payment of principal and interest under our Credit Facility; (iii) payments to CGM due or potentially due pursuant to the revised MSA and the LLC Agreement; (iv) cash distributions to our shareholders; and (v) investments in future acquisitions. Payments made under (i) through (iii) above are required to be paid before distributions to shareholders and may be significant and exceed the funds held by us, which may require us to dispose of assets or incur debt to fund such expenditures.\nWe believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our existing obligations, including quarterly distributions to our shareholders, as approved by our board of directors, over the next twelve months.\nFinancing Arrangements\n2018 Credit Facility\nIn April 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to amend and restate the 2014 Credit Facility. The 2018 Credit Facility provides for (i) revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit (the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) up to a maximum aggregate amount of $600 million, and (ii) a $500 million term loan.\nUnder the 2018 Term Loan, advances under term loans can be either Eurodollar rate loans or base rate loans. Eurodollar rate term loans bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each interest period at a rate per annum based on the Eurodollar Rate for such interest period plus a margin of either 2.25% or 2.50%, based on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. Base rate term loans bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus either 1.25% or 1.50%, based on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. The initial 2018 Term Loan was advanced as a Eurodollar rate loan. Advances under the 2018 Revolving Line of Credit can be either Eurodollar rate loans or base rate loans. Eurodollar rate revolving loans bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each interest period at a rate per annum based on the London Interbank Offered Rate approved by the Agent (the Eurodollar Rate\u201d) for such interest period plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50%, based on the ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before\ninterest expense, tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses for such period (the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio\u201d). Base rate revolving loans bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the Agent as its prime rate\u201d, and (iii) Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0% (the Base Rate\u201d), plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50%, based on its Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.\n(Refer to \"Note H - Debt\" of the consolidated financial statements for a complete description of our 2018 Credit Facility.)\nAt December 31, 2018, we had Letters of Credit totaling $0.3 million outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. We had approximately $371.7 million in borrowing base availability under this facility at December 31, 2018.\n2014 Credit Facility\nThe 2014 Credit Facility, as amended, provided for (i) a revolving credit facility of $550 million, (ii) a $325 million term loan (the \"2014 Term Loan\"), and (iii) a $250 million incremental term loan. The 2018 Credit Facility amended and restated the 2014 Credit Facility.\nSenior Notes\nOn April 18, 2018, we consummated the issuance and sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes offered pursuant to a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S under the Securities Act. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay debt under our existing credit facilities in connection with a concurrent refinancing transaction described above. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 18, 2018 (the Indenture\u201d), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 8.000% per annum and will mature on May 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes is payable in cash on May 1st and November 1st of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018. The Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries.\nThe Indenture contains several restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on the following: (i) the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (ii) restricted payments, (iii) dividends and other payments affecting restricted subsidiaries, (iv) the issuance of preferred stock of restricted subsidiaries, (v) transactions with affiliates, (vi) asset sales and mergers and consolidations, (vii) future subsidiary guarantees and (viii) liens, subject in each case to certain exceptions.\nThe following table reflects required and actual financial ratios as of December 31, 2018 included as part of the affirmative covenants in our 2018 Credit Facility:\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description of Required Covenant Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Covenant Ratio Requirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Greater than or equal to 1.50:1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.81:1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Secured Debt to EBITDA Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than or equal to 3.50:1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.54:1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than or equal to 5.00:1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.96:1.00\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to use the availability under our Credit Facility and cash on hand to pursue acquisitions of additional businesses, to fund distributions and to provide for other working capital needs. We believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity and capital resources, which include amounts available under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, to meet our existing obligations, including quarterly distributions to our shareholders, as approved by our board of directors, over the next twelve months.\nOn September 16, 2014, we purchased an interest rate swap ( Swap\u201d) with a notional amount of $220 million effective April 1, 2016 through June 6, 2021. The agreement requires us to pay interest on the notional amount at the rate of 2.97% in exchange for the three-month LIBOR rate. At December 31, 2018, the Swap had a fair value loss of $2.1 million, principally reflecting the present value of future payments and receipts under the agreement. $0.6 million of Swap is reflected as a component of current liabilities and $1.5 million is reflected as a component of noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018.\nInterest Expense\nWe incurred interest expense totaling $55.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $27.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 and $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The agreement requires us to pay interest on the notional amount at the rate of 2.97% in exchange for the three-month LIBOR rate.\nIncome Taxes\nCompass Diversified Holdings and Compass Group Diversified Holdings LLC are classified as partnerships for U.S. Federal income tax purposes and are not subject to income taxes. Each of the Company's majority owned subsidiaries are subject to Federal, state and in some cases, foreign income taxes. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the Tax Act on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax as of December 31, 2017. The Company substantially completed its accounting for the revaluation of its net U.S. federal deferred tax liabilities and recorded a tax benefit of approximately $34.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The one-time transition tax under the Tax Act is based on earnings and profits (\"E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes included provisional tax expense of $4.9 million related to the one-time transition tax liability of our foreign subsidiaries. The Company completed the calculation of the total E&P for these foreign subsidiaries during 2018 and recorded additional adjustments to the provisional amounts of $0.4 million that is recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe Tax Act also subjects the Company to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost in the year the tax is incurred.\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $6.5 million with an annual effective rate of 187.1% during the year ended December 31, 2018, an income tax benefit of $40.7 million with an annual effective tax rate of (549.2)% during the year ended December 31, 2017, and $9.5 million in income tax expense with an effective tax rate of 15% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our gains and losses incurred at the Company's parent, which is an LLC, are not tax deductible at the corporate level as those costs are passed through to the shareholders.\nThe components of our income tax (benefit) expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States Federal Statutory Rate\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income taxes (net of Federal benefits)\n</td> <td>(22.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign income taxes\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses of Compass Group Diversified Holdings LLC\nrepresenting a pass through to shareholders (1)\n</td> <td>84.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of gain on investment in FOX\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of subsidiary employee stock options\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic production activities deduction\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-deductible acquisition costs\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of undistributed foreign earnings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recognition of NOL carryforwards at subsidiaries\n</td> <td>27.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to uncertain tax positions (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(124.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization of tax credits\n</td> <td>(15.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Tax Act - GILTI tax\n</td> <td>49.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Tax Act - remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities (3)\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(468.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Tax Act - transition tax on non-U.S. subsidiaries' earnings (3)\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>187.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(549.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The effective income tax rate for each of the years presented includes losses at the Company's parent, which is taxed as a partnership.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents the effect of the reversal of an uncertain tax position at our 5.11 business that existed as of the acquisition date and was settled during the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a tax benefit of $9.2 million in our 2017 tax provision.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>The effect of the enactment of the Tax Act on our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a benefit of $34.7 million related to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and tax expense of $4.9 million related to the one-time transition tax liability of our foreign subsidiaries. Our income before income taxes for 2017 was a loss of $7.4 million, and as a result, the effect from the Tax Act on the reconciliation in the table above was significant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nFrom time to time we may publicly disclose certain non-GAAP\u201d financial measures in the course of our investor presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls or other venues. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future performance, financial position or cash flow that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts, included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements, and vice versa for measures that include amounts, or are subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure as calculated and presented. GAAP or US GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. These measures are not meant to be a substitute for GAAP, and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe tables below reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Flow Available for Distribution and Reinvestment ( CAD\u201d).\nReconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA - Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is calculated as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation expense and amortization expense. Amortization expenses consist of amortization of intangibles and debt charges, including debt issuance costs, discounts, etc.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Is calculated utilizing the same calculation as described above in arriving at EBITDA further adjusted by: (i) non-controlling shareholder compensation, which generally consists of non-cash stock option expense; (ii) successful acquisition costs, which consist of transaction costs (legal, accounting, due diligences, etc.) incurred in connection with the successful acquisition of a business expensed during the period in compliance with ASC 805; (iii) management fees, which reflect fees due quarterly to our Manager in connection with our MSA; (iv) impairment charges, which reflect write downs to goodwill or other intangible assets; (v) gains or losses recorded in connection with changes in the fair value of our investment in FOX; (vi) gains or losses recorded in connection with the sale of fixed assets; and (vii) gains or losses recognized upon the sale of a business.\nWe believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and reflect important financial measures as they exclude the effects of items which reflect the impact of long-term investment decisions, rather than the performance of near term operations. When compared to net income (loss) these financial measures are limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capital assets used in generating revenues of our businesses or the non-cash charges associated with impairments. This presentation also allows investors to view the performance of our businesses in a manner similar to the methods used by us and the management of our businesses, provides additional insight into our operating results and provides a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition.\nWe believe these measurements are also useful in measuring our ability to service debt and other payment obligations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not meant to be a substitute for GAAP, and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe following tables reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), which we consider to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nTable 261: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

and Reinvestment\nThe table below details cash receipts and payments that are not reflected on our income statement in order to provide an additional measure of management's estimate of cash CAD. CAD is a non-GAAP measure that we believe provides additional information to our shareholders in order to enable them to evaluate our ability to make anticipated quarterly distributions. Because other entities do not necessarily calculate CAD the same way we do, our presentation of CAD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other entities. We believe that our historic and future CAD, together with our cash balances and access to cash via our debt facilities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated distributions over the next twelve months. The table below reconciles CAD to net income and to cash flow provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 264: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The MSA provides for, among other things, CGM to perform services for us in exchange for a management fee paid quarterly and equal to 0.5% of our adjusted net assets. The management fee is required to be paid prior to the payment of any distributions to shareholders. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we incurred $44.3 million, $32.7 million, and $29.4 million, respectively, in management fees to CGM (excludes offsetting fees paid by Tridien in 2016).\nPursuant to the MSA, CGM is entitled to enter into off-setting management service agreements with each of our segments. The amount of the fee is negotiated between CGM and the operating management of each segment and is based upon the value of the services to be provided. The fees paid directly to CGM by the segments offset on a dollar for dollar basis the amount due to CGM by the Company under the MSA. During the current year, the Company paid CGM $0.4 million representing the management fee due from Manitoba Harvest in 2018. At December 31, 2018, Manitoba Harvest has accrued $0.4 million due to the Company to reimburse us for the management fee paid on their behalf. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2018, CGM waived $0.6 million in management fees attributable to the assets acquired in September related to the acquisitions by Velocity Outdoor and Clean Earth.\nLLC Agreement\nAs distinguished from its provision of providing management services to us, pursuant to the amended MSA, members of CGM are owners of 49.0% of the Allocation Interests in us through their ownership in Sostratus LLC. The LLC agreement gives the holders of Allocation Interests the right to distributions pursuant to a profit allocation formula upon the occurrence of a Sale Event or a Holding Event. The Allocation Interest Holders are entitled to receive and as such can elect to receive the positive contribution-based profit allocation payment for each of the business acquisitions during the 30-day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in that business (Holding Event) and upon the sale of the business (Sale Event). During the year ended December 31, 2017, Holders received $39.2 million in distributions related to Sale Events in November 2016 and March 2017 of FOX shares. At December 31, 2016, we accrued a distribution payable to the Allocation Interest Holders of $13.4 million related to our November 2016 sale of FOX shares. This distribution was paid in the first quarter of 2017. Holders received $25.8 million related to the March 2017 sale of FOX shares. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Holders received $23.8 million in total distributions related to Sale Events of FOX shares in March and August 2016, a fifth year anniversary Holding Event of our ACI business, and the sale of Tridien in September 2016. No Sale or Holding Events occurred during 2018.\nCertain persons who are employees and partners of the Manager, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, beneficially own 49.0% of the Allocation Interests, through Sostratus LLC, at December 31, 2018. Of the remaining 51.0% non-voting ownership of the Allocation Interests, 5.0% is held by CGI Diversified Holdings LP, 5.0% is held by the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, and the remaining 41.0% is held by the former founding partners of the Manager.\nIntegration Services Agreement\nIntegration services represent fees paid by newly acquired companies to the Manager for integration services performed during the first year of ownership. Foam Fabricators, which was acquired in 2018, Velocity Outdoor, which was acquired in June 2017, and 5.11, which was acquired in 2016, each entered into Integration Services Agreements (\"ISA\") with CGM. The ISA provides for CGM to provide services for new platform acquisitions to, amongst other things, assist the management at the acquired entities in establishing a corporate governance program, including the retention of independent board members to serve on their board of directors, implement compliance and reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") and align the acquired entity's policies and procedures with our other subsidiaries. Each ISA is for the twelve month period subsequent to the acquisition and is payable quarterly. Foam paid or will pay CGM a total integration service fee of $2.3 million, with $2.0 million paid in 2018, and the remainder to be paid in the first quarter of 2019. Velocity paid CGM a total integration service fee of $1.5 million, with $0.75 million paid in 2017, and $0.75 million paid in 2018. 5.11 paid CGM $3.5 million under the agreement, with $1.2 million paid in 2016, and $2.3 million paid in 2017.\nConsulting Agreement\nDuring 2018, one of our directors was engaged by our Manager to provide certain consulting services to our Manager. The director was paid $0.2 million by our Manager for the provision of such services to our Manager. Our Manager is\nentitled to receive certain payments from us as set forth in our Management Services Agreement. The Company did not pay the Manager for any payments to the director and was not a participant in the transaction.\nCost Reimbursement and Fees\nWe reimbursed CGM approximately $4.1 million, $3.8 million, and $3.8 million, principally for occupancy and staffing costs incurred by CGM on our behalf during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nInvestment in FOX\nAs of July 10, 2014, our ownership interest in FOX decreased from 53% to approximately 41% after we sold shares in a secondary offering by FOX. Since we no longer held a majority interest in FOX, we began accounting for our investment in FOX at fair value utilizing the equity method of accounting. We elected to measure our investment in FOX using the fair value option fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as income (loss). In November 2016, our ownership interest in FOX decreased to approximately 14%. In March 2017, FOX closed on a secondary offering through which we sold our remaining 5,108,718 shares in FOX for total net proceeds of $136.1 million, after the underwriter's discount of $8.9 million. Subsequent to the sale of FOX shares in March 2017, we no longer hold an ownership interest in FOX.\nThe following table reflects the 2017 and 2016 activity from our investment in FOX (in thousands):\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance January 1st\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of FOX shares, net - March\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(136,147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,685\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of FOX shares, net - August\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of FOX shares, net - November\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,785\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mark-to-market adjustment - investment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,620\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance December 31st\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The mark-to-market adjustment represents the change in the fair value of the FOX common shares for the period indicated. The 2017 mark-to-market adjustment represents the unrealized loss on the investment in FOX as of the date of the FOX secondary offering through which we sold our remaining shares in FOX.\nThe Company and its businesses have the following significant related party transactions:\n5.11\nRelated Party Vendor Purchases - 5.11 purchases inventory from a vendor who is a related party to 5.11 through one of the executive officers of 5.11 via the executive's 40% ownership interest in the vendor. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, 5.11 purchased approximately $5.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively, in inventory from the vendor.\nACI\nRecapitalization - During the second quarter of 2016, the Company completed a recapitalization at ACI whereby the Company entered into an amendment to the intercompany debt agreement with ACI (the \"ACI Loan Agreement\"). The ACI loan agreement was amended to provide for additional term loan borrowings of $61.0 million to fund a cash distribution to shareholders totaling $60.1 million. Minority interest shareholders of Advanced Circuits, including certain members of management at Advanced Circuits, received total distribution proceeds of $18.4 million. The Company used cash on hand to fund the distribution to minority shareholders.\nLiberty\nRecapitalization - During the first quarter of 2016, we completed a recapitalization at Liberty whereby we entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with Liberty (the Liberty Loan Agreement\u201d). The Liberty Loan Agreement was amended to (i) provide for term loan borrowings of $38.0 million and revolving credit facility borrowings of $5.0 million to fund cash distributions totaling $35.3 million to its shareholders, including the Company, and (ii) extend the maturity dates of the term loans and revolving credit facility. Liberty's noncontrolling shareholders received approximately $5.3 million in distributions as a result of the recapitalization. Immediately prior to the recapitalization,\nmanagement exercised stock options for 75,095 shares of Liberty common shares, resulting in net proceeds from stock options at Liberty of $3.8 million. Liberty recognized $0.3 million in compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of a portion of management's stock options at the time of exercise. We then purchased $1.5 million in Liberty common shares from members of Liberty management, resulting in Liberty's noncontrolling shareholders holding 11.4% of Liberty's outstanding shares subsequent to the recapitalization. The purchase of the Liberty common stock from noncontrolling shareholders and issuance of Liberty common stock related to the exercise of stock options by noncontrolling shareholders were at fair value and resulted in no change in control of Liberty. The difference between the consideration paid for the noncontrolling interest and the adjustment to the carrying amount of our noncontrolling interest in Liberty was recognized in our equity. Subsequent to the purchase of Liberty common shares and the exercise of the options, we own 88.6% of Liberty on a primary basis and 84.7% on a fully diluted basis.\nLiberty Related Party Vendor Purchases - Liberty purchases inventory raw materials from two vendors who are related parties to Liberty through two of the executive officers of Liberty via the employment of family members at the vendors. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Liberty purchased approximately $2.1 million, $2.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in raw materials from the two vendors.\nSterno\nRecapitalization - In January 2018, the Company completed a recapitalization at Sterno whereby the Company entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with Sterno (the \"Sterno Loan Agreement\"). The Sterno Loan Agreement was amended to (i) provide for term loan borrowings of $56.8 million to fund a distribution to the Company, which owned 100% of the outstanding equity of Sterno at the time of the recapitalization, and (ii) extend the maturity dates of the term loans. In connection with the recapitalization, Sterno's management team exercised all of their vested stock options, which represented 58,000 shares of Sterno. The Company then used a portion of the distribution to repurchase the 58,000 shares from management for a total purchase price of $6.0 million. In addition, Sterno issued new stock options to replace the exercised option, thus maintaining the same percentage of fully diluted non-controlling interest that existed prior to the recapitalization.\nClean Earth\nIn January 2018, Clean Earth purchased a permit and some tangible property consisting primarily of machinery and equipment from an officer of the company for approximately $2 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no special purpose entities or off balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nContractual Obligations\nLong-term contractual obligations, except for our long-term debt obligations, are generally not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet. Non-cancelable purchase obligations are obligations we incur during the normal course of business, based on projected needs.\nThe table below summarizes the payment schedule of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018:\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,505,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>964,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>153,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>862,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,521,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>344,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>489,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>678,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,008,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Reflects commitment fees and letter of credit fees under our Revolving Credit Facility and amounts due, together with interest on our Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Reflects various operating leases for office space, manufacturing facilities and equipment from third parties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Reflects non-cancelable commitments as of December 31, 2018, including: (i) shareholder distributions of $101.4 million; (ii) estimated management fees of $46.6 million per year over the next five years; and (iii) other obligations, including amounts due under employment agreements.

Such estimates and judgments may involve varying degrees of uncertainty. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and changes in other facts and circumstances, and potentially could result in materially different results. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed below. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those policies discussed below, refer to \"Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard. The new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard, and all related amendments, was effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 and was adopted using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.\nThe adoption of the new revenue guidance represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the transfer of control of our goods and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures. In accordance with the new revenue guidance, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services, and excludes any sales incentives or taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to government authorities.\nThe Company's contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products to a customer. Determining whether the promises are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once the performance obligations are identified, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative stand-alone selling price method. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied as discussed above. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately and therefore observable.\nUpon adoption of the new revenue guidance, the Company's policy around estimating variable consideration related to sales incentives (early pay discounts, rights of return, rebates, chargebacks, and other discounts) included in certain customer contracts remained consistent with previous guidance. These incentives are recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Under the new guidance, variable consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method or the most likely outcome method. The method was applied consistently among each type of variable consideration and the Company applies the expected value method to estimate variable consideration. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and the Company's best judgment at the time and as a result, reflect applicable constraints. The Company includes in the transaction price an amount of variable consideration estimated in accordance with the new guidance only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Accounting for business combinations requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to allocate the purchase price. The estimates of fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable using established valuation methods, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information. The determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by our management team and, when appropriate, valuations by independent third-party appraisers. We amortize intangible assets, such as trademarks and customer\nrelationships, as well as property, plant and equipment, over their economic useful lives, unless those lives are indefinite. We consider factors such as historical information, our plans for the asset and similar assets held by our previously acquired portfolio companies. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess amount of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired. Our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of March 31st, and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. Each of our businesses represents a reporting unit except Arnold, which we determined comprised three reporting units when it was acquired in March 2012. As a result of changes implemented by Arnold management during 2016 and 2017, we reassessed the reporting units at Arnold as of the annual impairment testing date in 2018. After evaluating changes in the operation of the reporting units that led to increased integration and altered how the financial results of the Arnold operating segment were assessed by Arnold management, the Company determined that the previously identified reporting units no longer operate in the same manner as they did when the Company acquired Arnold. As a result, the separate Arnold reporting units were determined to only comprise one reporting unit at the Arnold operating segment level as of March 31, 2018. As part of the exercise of combining the separate Arnold reporting units into one reporting unit, we performed \"before\" and \"after\" goodwill impairment testing, whereby we performed the annual impairment testing for each of the existing reporting units of Arnold and then subsequent to the completion of the annual impairment testing of the separate reporting units, we performed a quantitative impairment test of the Arnold operating segment, which will represent the reporting unit for future impairment tests.\nWe use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment testing. The qualitative factors we consider include, in part, the general macroeconomic environment, industry and market specific conditions for each reporting unit, financial performance including actual versus planned results and results of relevant prior periods, operating costs and cost impacts, as well as issues or events specific to the reporting unit. As part of the assessment of the Arnold reporting units at March 31, 2018, we performed impairment testing on the three separate reporting units. Two of the Arnold reporting units, PMAG and PTM, were tested qualitatively, while a quantitative impairment test was performed on the Flexmag reporting unit because we could not determine that it was more-likely than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. We then performed a quantitative impairment test of the Arnold operating segment, which combined the three reporting units. The results of the quantitative impairment testing of the Arnold reporting unit indicated that the fair value of the Arnold reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 254%. For the reporting units that were tested qualitatively, the results of the qualitative analysis indicated that the fair value exceeded their carrying value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\nWe use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names with a carrying value of approximately $70.4 million. The Manitoba Harvest trade name was tested for impairment as part of the interim impairment testing for Manitoba Harvest at December 31, 2017 as noted above. The results of the qualitative analysis of our other reporting unit's indefinite-lived intangible assets, which we completed as of March 31, 2018, indicated that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying value.\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nLong-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, including customer relationships, non-compete agreements, permits and technology are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service. We evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and is greater than its fair value, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized.\nThe determination of fair values and estimated useful lives requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process. This judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to our reporting units and intangible assets. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or the incurrence of an impairment charge.\nIncome taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act. Among other important changes in the Tax Act, the tax rate on corporations was reduced from 35% to 21%; a limitation on the deduction of interest expense was enacted; gain from the sale of a partnership interest by a foreign person will be subject to U.S. tax to the extent that the partnership is engaged in a trade or business; a special deduction for qualified business income from pass-through entities was added; U.S. federal income taxes on foreign earnings were eliminated (subject to several important exceptions), and new provisions designed to tax currently global intangible low taxed income (\"GILTI\") and a new base erosion anti-abuse tax were added.\nFor taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a deduction for interest will generally be allowed for any entity only up to 30% of adjusted taxable income (determined without regard to interest income or expense) plus the amount of interest income. Only interest income and expense incurred in a trade or business is taken into account, i.e., investment interest income and deductions are ignored. For partnerships, the limitation is applied at the partnership level and then adjustments are made at the partner level to avoid double counting and to allow an owner to use any excess income in calculating the interest deduction at his or her level. The provision will not limit the deduction of interest by the Company but it may have an impact the deduction for certain of the portfolio companies.\nSeveral of our majority owned subsidiaries have deferred tax assets recorded at December 31, 2018 which in total amount to approximately $55.2 million. This deferred tax asset is net of $6.9 million of valuation allowance primarily associated with net operating losses and foreign tax credits and the limitation on the deduction of interest expense at Arnold and 5.11. These deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of reserves not currently deductible for tax purposes. The temporary differences that have resulted in the recording of these tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods, reducing the amount of taxes required to be paid. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income at those subsidiaries with deferred tax assets. Based upon the expected future results of operations, the Company believes it is more likely than not that those subsidiaries with deferred tax assets will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of existing temporary differences, although there can be no assurance of this. The impact of not realizing these deferred tax assets would result in an increase in income tax expense for such period when the determination was made that the assets are not realizable. (Refer to \"Note L - Income Taxes\" in the notes to consolidated financial statements.)\nProfit Allocation Interests\nAt the time of our Initial Public Offering, we issued Allocation Interests governed by our LLC agreement that entitle the holders (the \"Holders\") to receive distributions pursuant to a profit allocation formula upon the occurrence of certain events. The Holders are entitled to receive and as such can elect to receive the positive contribution based profit allocation payment for each of the business acquisitions during the 30-day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in that business (Holding Event) and upon the sale of that business (Sale Event).\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to \"Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of Compass Diversified Holdings and its financial operations, acquisitions, and dispositions. It includes financial data and analysis of the company's performance. The company acquired several businesses, contributing to an increase in net revenues.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Our actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently deem immaterial could also cause our actual results to differ, including those discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nCompass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust, was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company, was also formed on November 18, 2005. In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust is sole owner of 100% of the Trust Interests (as defined in the LLC Agreement) of the Company and, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Company has outstanding, the identical number of Trust Interests as the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. Sostratus LLC owns all of our Allocation Interests. The Company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities, similar to that of a Delaware corporation.\nThe Trust and the Company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. We characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to $60 million. We focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more susceptible to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow.\nIn pursuing new acquisitions, we seek businesses with the following characteristics:\n \u2022 North American base of operations; \n \u2022 stable and growing earnings and cash flow; \n \u2022 maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche (i.e., has a reason to exist\u201d); \n \u2022 solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives; \n \u2022 low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and \n \u2022 a diversified customer and supplier base.  Our management team's strategy for our subsidiaries involves:\n \u2022 utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract, recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses; \n \u2022 regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals; \n \u2022 assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies (both revenue and cost related); \n \u2022 identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and \n \u2022 forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors, including independent directors, to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives.  Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well- positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses. Our management team has a large network of approximately 2,000 deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team's active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. In consummating transactions, our management team has, in the past, been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations. We believe the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.\nIn addition, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our Revolving Credit Facility, we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate.\nInitial public offering and Company formation\nOn May 16, 2006, we completed our initial public offering of 13,500,000 shares of the Trust at an offering price of $15.00 per share (the IPO\u201d). Subsequent to the IPO the Company's board of directors engaged our Manager to externally manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company, oversee the management and operations of the businesses and to perform those services customarily performed by executive officers of a public company.\nFrom May 16, 2006 through December 31, 2018, we purchased nineteen businesses (each of our businesses is treated as a separate operating segment) and disposed of seven businesses. The tables below reflect summarized information relating to our acquisitions and dispositions from the date of our IPO through December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nAcquisitions\n\n(1) The total purchase price for CBS Holdings includes the acquisition of Staffmark Investment LLC in January 2008 for a purchase price of $128.6 million. The Company renamed its CBS Personnel business Staffmark subsequent to the acquisition.\n(2) FOX completed an IPO of its common stock in August 2013 in which we sold a 22% interest in FOX, reducing our ownership interest to 53%. In July 2014, FOX completed a secondary offering in which we sold a 12% interest in FOX, reducing our ownership interest to 41% and resulting in the deconsolidation of FOX from our financial results. We subsequently sold our remaining shares of FOX and now hold no ownership interest in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sale of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million.\n(3) The total purchase price does not reflect add-on acquisitions made by our businesses subsequent to their purchase by CODI unless indicated.\n(4) The total purchase price of Sterno includes the acquisition of Rimports, Inc. in February 2018 for a purchase price of $154.4 million.\n(5) Velocity Outdoor (formerly \"Crosman Corp.\") was purchased by the Company in May 2006 and subsequently sold in January 2007. We reacquired Velocity Outdoor in June 2017.\nDispositions\n\n(1) CODI portion of the net proceeds from disposition includes debt and equity proceeds and reflects the accounting for the redemption of the sold business's minority shareholders and transaction expenses.\n(2) Gain (loss) recognized on sale of our businesses is calculated by deducting our total invested capital from the net sale proceeds received.\n* We made loans to and purchased a controlling interest in FOX on January 4, 2008, for approximately $80.4 million. In August 2013, FOX completed an initial public offering of its common stock. As a result of the initial public offering, our ownership interest in FOX was reduced to approximately 53.9%. No gain was reflected as a result of the sale of our FOX shares in the initial public offering because our majority classification of FOX did not change. FOX used a portion of their net proceeds received from the sale of their shares as well as proceeds from a new external FOX credit facility to repay $61.5 million in outstanding indebtedness to us under their existing credit facility with us. In July 2014, through a secondary offering, our ownership in FOX was lowered from approximately 53% to approximately 41%, and as a result we deconsolidated FOX as of July 10, 2014. In March and August 2016, through two more secondary offerings and a share repurchase by FOX, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 23% as of September 30, 2016. In November 2016, through another secondary offering, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 14%. On March 13, 2017, FOX closed on a secondary public offering of 5,108,718 shares of FOX common stock held by CODI, which represented CODI's remaining investment in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sales of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million, plus proceeds from the repayment of the FOX credit facility of $61.5 million upon completion of their initial public offering, and a total gain of $428.7 million.\nWe are dependent on the earnings of, and cash receipts from, the businesses that we own in order to meet our corporate overhead and management fee expenses and to pay distributions. The earnings and distributions of our businesses are generally lowest in the first quarter, and strongest in the third and fourth quarter, of each fiscal year. These earnings and distributions, net of any non-controlling interest in these businesses, are available to:\n \u2022 meet capital expenditure requirements, management fees and corporate overhead charges; \n \u2022 fund distributions from the businesses to the Company; and \n \u2022 be distributed by the Trust to shareholders.  2018 Highlights and Recent Events\nAcquisition of Foam Fabricators\nOn February 15, 2018, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary FFI Compass, Inc., acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Foam Fabricators, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Foam Fabricators\u201d), for a purchase price of approximately $253.4 million. Foam Fabricators is a leading designer and manufacturer of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components made from expanded polymers such as expanded polystyrene and expanded polypropylene. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, it operates 13 molding and fabricating facilities across North America and provides products to a variety of end-markets, including appliances and\nelectronics, pharmaceuticals, health and wellness, automotive, building products and others. We funded our acquisition of Foam Fabricators with a draw on our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility.\nAcquisition of Rimports\nOn February 26, 2018, our Sterno subsidiary acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Rimports, Inc.,, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated January 23, 2018. Sterno purchased a 100% controlling interest in Rimports. Headquartered in Provo, Utah, Rimports is a manufacturer and distributor of branded and private label scented wickless candle products used for home d\u00e9cor and fragrance. Rimports offers an extensive line of wax warmers, scented wax cubes, essential oils and diffusers, and other home fragrance systems, through the mass retailer channel. The purchase price, net of transaction costs, was approximately $154.4 million, subject to any working capital adjustment. The purchase price of Rimports includes a potential earn-out of up to $25 million contingent on the attainment of certain future performance criteria of Rimports. At December 31, 2018, the earn-out was not expected to be paid. Sterno funded the acquisition through their intercompany credit facility with the Company.\nAcquisition of ESMI\nOn May 23, 2018, Clean Earth acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Environmental Soil Management, Inc.( ESMI\u201d), located in Fort Edward, New York and Loudon, New Hampshire. The acquisition provided Clean Earth the opportunity to geographically expand their soil and hazardous waste solutions in the New York and New England market. The purchase price was approximately $31.0 million.\nAcquisition of Ravin\nOn September 4, 2018, Velocity Outdoor (formerly \"Crosman Corp.\") acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Ravin for a purchase price of approximately $98.0 million, net of transaction costs, plus a potential earn-out of up to $25.0 million based on gross profit levels as of December 31, 2018. Headquartered in Superior, Wisconsin, Ravin Crossbows is a leading designer, manufacturer and innovator of crossbows and accessories. Ravin primarily focuses on the higher-end segment of the crossbow market and has developed significant intellectual property related to the advancement of crossbow technology. The acquisition of Ravin positions Velocity Outdoor to more fully capitalize on the sizeable crossbow market, further diversify its customer base and take advantage of the product and market expertise inside of Ravin.\nTrust Preferred Share Issuance\nOn March 13, 2018, the Trust issued 4,000,000 Series B Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $100.0 million, or $96.5 million net of underwriters' discount and issuance costs. Distributions on the Series B Preferred Shares will be payable quarterly in arrears, when and as declared by the Company's board of directors on January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30 of each year, beginning on July 30, 2018. Distributions on the Series B Preferred Shares are cumulative.\nSenior Notes and 2018 Credit Facility\nOn April 18, 2018, we consummated the issuance and sale of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.000% Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d or \"Senior Notes\") offered pursuant to a private offering. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay debt under our existing credit facilities in connection with a concurrent refinancing of our 2014 Credit Facility. The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 8.000% per annum and will mature on May 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes is payable in cash on May 1st and November 1st of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018. The Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries.\nConcurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2018 Credit Facility\") to amend and restate the 2014 Credit Facility, originally dated as of June 6, 2014 (as previously amended) among the Company, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The 2018 Credit Facility provides for (i) revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit (the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) up to a maximum aggregate amount of $600 million, and (ii) a $500 million term loan (the 2018 Term Loan\u201d). The 2018 Term Loan was issued at an original issuance discount of 99.75%. We used the proceeds from the 2018 Credit Facility and the proceeds from the Notes offering to pay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit agreement and to pay the fees, original issue discount and expenses incurred in connection with the 2018 Credit Facility and Notes.\n2018 Distributions\nCommon shares - For the 2018 fiscal year we declared distributions to our common shareholders totaling $1.44 per share.\nPreferred shares - For the 2018 fiscal year we declared distributions to our preferred shareholders totaling $1.8125 per share on our Series A Preferred Shares and $1.724375 on our Series B Preferred Shares.\nSubsequent Event\nManitoba Harvest\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Tilray, Inc. (\"Tilray\") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tilray, 1197879 B.C. Ltd. ( Tilray Subco\u201d), to sell to Tilray, Inc., through Tilray Subco, all of the issued and outstanding securities of Manitoba Harvest for total consideration of up to C$419 million. Subject to certain customary adjustments, the shareholders of Manitoba Harvest, including the Company, may receive the following from Tilray as consideration for their shares of Manitoba Harvest: (i) C$150 million in cash to the holders of preferred shares of Manitoba Harvest and the holders of common shares of Manitoba Harvest ( Common Holders\u201d) and C$127.5 million in shares of class 2 Common Stock of Tilray ( Common Stock\u201d) to the Common Holders on the closing date of the sale (the Closing Date Consideration\u201d), (ii) C$50 million in cash and C$42.5 million in Common Stock to the Common Holders on the date that is six months after the closing date of the Arrangement (the Deferred Consideration\u201d) and (iii) C$49 million in Common Stock to the Common Holders, which amount may be reduced, potentially to zero, if Manitoba Harvest fails to attain certain levels of U.S. branded gross sales of edible or topical products containing broad spectrum hemp extracts or cannabidiols prior to December 31, 2019. The cash portion of the Closing Date Consideration will be reduced by the amount of the net indebtedness of Manitoba Harvest on the closing date and transaction expenses expected to be approximately $5 million. The Common Stock consideration is expected to be issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and pursuant to exemptions from applicable securities laws of any state of the United States, such that any shares of Common Stock received by the Common Holders will be freely tradeable. The sale of Manitoba Harvest will occur pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Business Operations Act (British Columbia). The completion of the plan of arrangement was subject to approval by the British Columbia Supreme Court, which occurred on February 21, 2019. The sale is expected to close as soon as practicable following receipt of court approval.\n2019 Outlook and Significant Trends\nDuring 2018, the middle market continued to be an active segment for deal flow, with further acceleration of deal flow expected in 2019. High valuation levels continue to be driven by the availability of debt capital with favorable terms and financial and strategic buyers seeking to deploy available equity capital. We believe that companies will focus on expanding their customer bases by diversifying their products and services in existing geographic areas during 2019.\nWe remain focused on marketing the Company's attractive ownership and management attributes to potential sellers of middle market businesses and intermediaries. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for add-on acquisitions by certain of our existing subsidiary companies, which can be particularly attractive from a strategic perspective.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor 2019, we anticipate our niche industrial companies, combined as a whole, will continue to grow revenue and earnings as a result of the overall health of the economy. Our branded consumer companies, combined as a whole, may be impacted in 2019 by the continued weakening in the U.S. retail landscape, specifically, lower consumer foot traffic in brick and mortar retail, and the related shift to more online shopping. We believe our branded consumer companies' combined as a whole, with their strong positions in their respective markets and powerful brands, remain well positioned to grow revenue and earnings in 2019, notwithstanding this difficult landscape.\nThe areas of focus for 2019, which are generally applicable to each of our businesses, include:\n \u2022 Achieving sales growth through a combination of new product development, increasing distribution and international expansion; \n \u2022 Taking market share, where possible, in each of our niche market leading companies, generally at the expense of less well capitalized competitors; \n \u2022 Striving for excellence in supply chain management, manufacturing and technological capabilities; \n \u2022 Continuing to pursue expense reduction and cost savings in lower margin business lines or in response to lower production volume; \n \u2022 Continuing to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions and rigorous integration processes; and \n \u2022 Driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management, enabling continued investment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, and distributions to our shareholders. \nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion reflects a comparison of the historical results of operations of our consolidated business for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and components of the results of operations as well as those components presented as a percent of net revenues, for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis.\nWe acquired Foam Fabricators in February 2018, Velocity Outdoor in June 2017, 5.11 in August 2016 and our Sterno business acquired Rimports in February 2018. In the following results of operations, we provide (i) our actual Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, which includes the historical results of operations of each of our businesses (operating segments) from the date of acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and (ii) comparative historical components of the results of operations for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis ( Results of Operations - Our Businesses\u201d), for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, where all years presented include relevant pro-forma adjustments for pre-acquisition periods and explanations where applicable. For the 2018 acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased these businesses on January 1, 2017. The historical operating results of Rimports have been added to the previously reported Sterno results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Sterno results of operations for the 2018 period prior to acquisition by Sterno. For the 2017 acquisition of Velocity Outdoor and the 2016 acquisition of 5.11, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased these businesses on January 1, 2016. We believe this presentation enhances the discussion and provides a more meaningful comparison of operating results. The following operating results of our businesses are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, going forward.\nAll dollar amounts in the financial tables are presented in thousands. References in the financial tables to percentage changes that are not meaningful are denoted by \"NM.\"\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Compass Diversified Holdings\n\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet revenues\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by approximately $421.9 million or 33.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $113.4 million and $145.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue, while our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor in June 2017 contributed $52.9 million to the increase, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018. We also saw notable sales increases at Clean\nEarth ($55.7 million), 5.11 ($37.9 million), Manitoba ($11.7 million), Arnold ($12.3 million) and our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports ($9.4 million). These increases in revenue were partially offset by decreases in net revenue at Liberty ($9.3 million) and Ergo ($12.4 million) in 2018 as compared to 2017. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of net revenue by business segment.\nWe do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and, in some cases, dividends on our equity ownership. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated.\nCost of revenues\nOn a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately $295.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $82.6 million and $110.5 million, respectively, to the increase in cost of revenues, while our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor in June 2017 contributed $35.3 million to the increase, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018. Clean Earth's cost of revenue increased $41.4 million, in line with the increase in revenues during 2018, while our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports had an increase in cost of revenues of $9.3 million, Manitoba Harvest ($8.0 million) and Arnold had an increase in cost of revenues of $8.6 million, both in line with the increase in revenues at these entities. These increases were offset by decreases in cost of revenues at other operating segments, particularly Ergo ($3.1 million decrease) and Liberty ($3.3 million decrease).\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 33.9% in year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 35.3% in 2017. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately $74.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase in expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 is principally the result of the acquisition of Foam Fabricators ($12.3 million including $1.6 million in acquisition costs), Rimports ($4.0 million, including $0.6 million in acquisition costs) and Velocity Outdoor ($10.4 million) reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018 and acquisition costs related to Ravin of $1.4 million. We also saw notable increases in selling, general and administrative year-over-year at 5.11 ($22.2 million) and Clean Earth ($10.8 million). Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense increased from $12.7 million in 2017 to $14.3 million in 2018, primarily due to increased professional fees associated with governance and compliance costs related to the implementation of new accounting standards.\nFees to manager\nPursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred approximately $44.3 million in expense for these fees compared to", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Our actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently deem immaterial could also cause our actual results to differ, including those discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nCompass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust, was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company, was also formed on November 18, 2005. In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust is sole owner of 100% of the Trust Interests (as defined in the LLC Agreement) of the Company and, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Company has outstanding, the identical number of Trust Interests as the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. Sostratus LLC owns all of our Allocation Interests. The Company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities, similar to that of a Delaware corporation.\nThe Trust and the Company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. We characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to $60 million. We focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more susceptible to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow.\nIn pursuing new acquisitions, we seek businesses with the following characteristics:\n \u2022 North American base of operations; \n \u2022 stable and growing earnings and cash flow; \n \u2022 maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche (i.e., has a reason to exist\u201d); \n \u2022 solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives; \n \u2022 low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and \n \u2022 a diversified customer and supplier base.  Our management team's strategy for our subsidiaries involves:\n \u2022 utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract, recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses; \n \u2022 regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals; \n \u2022 assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies (both revenue and cost related); \n \u2022 identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and \n \u2022 forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors, including independent directors, to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives.  Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well- positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses. Our management team has a large network of approximately 2,000 deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team's active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. In consummating transactions, our management team has, in the past, been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations. We believe the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.\nIn addition, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our Revolving Credit Facility, we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate.\nInitial public offering and Company formation\nOn May 16, 2006, we completed our initial public offering of 13,500,000 shares of the Trust at an offering price of $15.00 per share (the IPO\u201d). Subsequent to the IPO the Company's board of directors engaged our Manager to externally manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company, oversee the management and operations of the businesses and to perform those services customarily performed by executive officers of a public company.\nFrom May 16, 2006 through December 31, 2018, we purchased nineteen businesses (each of our businesses is treated as a separate operating segment) and disposed of seven businesses. The tables below reflect summarized information relating to our acquisitions and dispositions from the date of our IPO through December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nAcquisitions\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ownership Interest - December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CODI Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Diluted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CBS Holdings (Staffmark) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crosman (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advanced Circuits (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silvue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tridien (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 1, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aeroglide\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Halo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>American Furniture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 31, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FOX (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 4, 2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liberty Safe (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ergobaby (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 16, 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CamelBak\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 24, 2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arnold Magnetics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 5, 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clean Earth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 7, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sterno (3) (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 10, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manitoba Harvest (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 10, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Velocity Outdoor (3) (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foam Fabricators\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The total purchase price for CBS Holdings includes the acquisition of Staffmark Investment LLC in January 2008 for a purchase price of $128.6 million.

In July 2014, FOX completed a secondary offering in which we sold a 12% interest in FOX, reducing our ownership interest to 41% and resulting in the deconsolidation of FOX from our financial results. We subsequently sold our remaining shares of FOX and now hold no ownership interest in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sale of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million.\n(3) The total purchase price does not reflect add-on acquisitions made by our businesses subsequent to their purchase by CODI unless indicated.\n(4) The total purchase price of Sterno includes the acquisition of Rimports, Inc. in February 2018 for a purchase price of $154.4 million.\n(5) Velocity Outdoor (formerly \"Crosman Corp.\") was purchased by the Company in May 2006 and subsequently sold in January 2007.

In August 2013, FOX completed an initial public offering of its common stock. As a result of the initial public offering, our ownership interest in FOX was reduced to approximately 53.9%. No gain was reflected as a result of the sale of our FOX shares in the initial public offering because our majority classification of FOX did not change. FOX used a portion of their net proceeds received from the sale of their shares as well as proceeds from a new external FOX credit facility to repay $61.5 million in outstanding indebtedness to us under their existing credit facility with us. In July 2014, through a secondary offering, our ownership in FOX was lowered from approximately 53% to approximately 41%, and as a result we deconsolidated FOX as of July 10, 2014. In March and August 2016, through two more secondary offerings and a share repurchase by FOX, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 23% as of September 30, 2016. In November 2016, through another secondary offering, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 14%. On March 13, 2017, FOX closed on a secondary public offering of 5,108,718 shares of FOX common stock held by CODI, which represented CODI's remaining investment in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sales of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million, plus proceeds from the repayment of the FOX credit facility of $61.5 million upon completion of their initial public offering, and a total gain of $428.7 million.\nWe are dependent on the earnings of, and cash receipts from, the businesses that we own in order to meet our corporate overhead and management fee expenses and to pay distributions. The earnings and distributions of our businesses are generally lowest in the first quarter, and strongest in the third and fourth quarter, of each fiscal year. These earnings and distributions, net of any non-controlling interest in these businesses, are available to:\n \u2022 meet capital expenditure requirements, management fees and corporate overhead charges; \n \u2022 fund distributions from the businesses to the Company; and \n \u2022 be distributed by the Trust to shareholders.  2018 Highlights and Recent Events\nAcquisition of Foam Fabricators\nOn February 15, 2018, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary FFI Compass, Inc., acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Foam Fabricators, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Foam Fabricators\u201d), for a purchase price of approximately $253.4 million. Foam Fabricators is a leading designer and manufacturer of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components made from expanded polymers such as expanded polystyrene and expanded polypropylene. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, it operates 13 molding and fabricating facilities across North America and provides products to a variety of end-markets, including appliances and\nelectronics, pharmaceuticals, health and wellness, automotive, building products and others. We funded our acquisition of Foam Fabricators with a draw on our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility.\nAcquisition of Rimports\nOn February 26, 2018, our Sterno subsidiary acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Rimports, Inc.,, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated January 23, 2018. Sterno purchased a 100% controlling interest in Rimports. Headquartered in Provo, Utah, Rimports is a manufacturer and distributor of branded and private label scented wickless candle products used for home d\u00e9cor and fragrance. Rimports offers an extensive line of wax warmers, scented wax cubes, essential oils and diffusers, and other home fragrance systems, through the mass retailer channel. The purchase price, net of transaction costs, was approximately $154.4 million, subject to any working capital adjustment. The purchase price of Rimports includes a potential earn-out of up to $25 million contingent on the attainment of certain future performance criteria of Rimports. At December 31, 2018, the earn-out was not expected to be paid. Sterno funded the acquisition through their intercompany credit facility with the Company.\nAcquisition of ESMI\nOn May 23, 2018, Clean Earth acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Environmental Soil Management, Inc.( ESMI\u201d), located in Fort Edward, New York and Loudon, New Hampshire. The acquisition provided Clean Earth the opportunity to geographically expand their soil and hazardous waste solutions in the New York and New England market. The purchase price was approximately $31.0 million.\nAcquisition of Ravin\nOn September 4, 2018, Velocity Outdoor (formerly \"Crosman Corp.\") acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Ravin for a purchase price of approximately $98.0 million, net of transaction costs, plus a potential earn-out of up to $25.0 million based on gross profit levels as of December 31, 2018. Headquartered in Superior, Wisconsin, Ravin Crossbows is a leading designer, manufacturer and innovator of crossbows and accessories. Ravin primarily focuses on the higher-end segment of the crossbow market and has developed significant intellectual property related to the advancement of crossbow technology. The acquisition of Ravin positions Velocity Outdoor to more fully capitalize on the sizeable crossbow market, further diversify its customer base and take advantage of the product and market expertise inside of Ravin.\nTrust Preferred Share Issuance\nOn March 13, 2018, the Trust issued 4,000,000 Series B Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $100.0 million, or $96.5 million net of underwriters' discount and issuance costs. Distributions on the Series B Preferred Shares will be payable quarterly in arrears, when and as declared by the Company's board of directors on January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30 of each year, beginning on July 30, 2018. Distributions on the Series B Preferred Shares are cumulative.\nSenior Notes and 2018 Credit Facility\nOn April 18, 2018, we consummated the issuance and sale of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.000% Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d or \"Senior Notes\") offered pursuant to a private offering. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay debt under our existing credit facilities in connection with a concurrent refinancing of our 2014 Credit Facility. The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 8.000% per annum and will mature on May 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes is payable in cash on May 1st and November 1st of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018. The Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries.\nConcurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2018 Credit Facility\") to amend and restate the 2014 Credit Facility, originally dated as of June 6, 2014 (as previously amended) among the Company, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders\u201d), and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The 2018 Credit Facility provides for (i) revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit (the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) up to a maximum aggregate amount of $600 million, and (ii) a $500 million term loan (the 2018 Term Loan\u201d). The 2018 Term Loan was issued at an original issuance discount of 99.75%. We used the proceeds from the 2018 Credit Facility and the proceeds from the Notes offering to pay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit agreement and to pay the fees, original issue discount and expenses incurred in connection with the 2018 Credit Facility and Notes.\n2018 Distributions\nCommon shares - For the 2018 fiscal year we declared distributions to our common shareholders totaling $1.44 per share.\nPreferred shares - For the 2018 fiscal year we declared distributions to our preferred shareholders totaling $1.8125 per share on our Series A Preferred Shares and $1.724375 on our Series B Preferred Shares.\nSubsequent Event\nManitoba Harvest\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Tilray, Inc. (\"Tilray\") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tilray, 1197879 B.C. Ltd. ( Tilray Subco\u201d), to sell to Tilray, Inc., through Tilray Subco, all of the issued and outstanding securities of Manitoba Harvest for total consideration of up to C$419 million. Subject to certain customary adjustments, the shareholders of Manitoba Harvest, including the Company, may receive the following from Tilray as consideration for their shares of Manitoba Harvest: (i) C$150 million in cash to the holders of preferred shares of Manitoba Harvest and the holders of common shares of Manitoba Harvest ( Common Holders\u201d) and C$127.5 million in shares of class 2 Common Stock of Tilray ( Common Stock\u201d) to the Common Holders on the closing date of the sale (the Closing Date Consideration\u201d), (ii) C$50 million in cash and C$42.5 million in Common Stock to the Common Holders on the date that is six months after the closing date of the Arrangement (the Deferred Consideration\u201d) and (iii) C$49 million in Common Stock to the Common Holders, which amount may be reduced, potentially to zero, if Manitoba Harvest fails to attain certain levels of U.S. branded gross sales of edible or topical products containing broad spectrum hemp extracts or cannabidiols prior to December 31, 2019. The cash portion of the Closing Date Consideration will be reduced by the amount of the net indebtedness of Manitoba Harvest on the closing date and transaction expenses expected to be approximately $5 million. The Common Stock consideration is expected to be issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and pursuant to exemptions from applicable securities laws of any state of the United States, such that any shares of Common Stock received by the Common Holders will be freely tradeable. The sale of Manitoba Harvest will occur pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Business Operations Act (British Columbia). The completion of the plan of arrangement was subject to approval by the British Columbia Supreme Court, which occurred on February 21, 2019. The sale is expected to close as soon as practicable following receipt of court approval.\n2019 Outlook and Significant Trends\nDuring 2018, the middle market continued to be an active segment for deal flow, with further acceleration of deal flow expected in 2019. High valuation levels continue to be driven by the availability of debt capital with favorable terms and financial and strategic buyers seeking to deploy available equity capital. We believe that companies will focus on expanding their customer bases by diversifying their products and services in existing geographic areas during 2019.\nWe remain focused on marketing the Company's attractive ownership and management attributes to potential sellers of middle market businesses and intermediaries. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for add-on acquisitions by certain of our existing subsidiary companies, which can be particularly attractive from a strategic perspective.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor 2019, we anticipate our niche industrial companies, combined as a whole, will continue to grow revenue and earnings as a result of the overall health of the economy. Our branded consumer companies, combined as a whole, may be impacted in 2019 by the continued weakening in the U.S. retail landscape, specifically, lower consumer foot traffic in brick and mortar retail, and the related shift to more online shopping. We believe our branded consumer companies' combined as a whole, with their strong positions in their respective markets and powerful brands, remain well positioned to grow revenue and earnings in 2019, notwithstanding this difficult landscape.\nThe areas of focus for 2019, which are generally applicable to each of our businesses, include:\n \u2022 Achieving sales growth through a combination of new product development, increasing distribution and international expansion; \n \u2022 Taking market share, where possible, in each of our niche market leading companies, generally at the expense of less well capitalized competitors; \n \u2022 Striving for excellence in supply chain management, manufacturing and technological capabilities; \n \u2022 Continuing to pursue expense reduction and cost savings in lower margin business lines or in response to lower production volume; \n \u2022 Continuing to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions and rigorous integration processes; and \n \u2022 Driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management, enabling continued investment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, and distributions to our shareholders. \nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion reflects a comparison of the historical results of operations of our consolidated business for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and components of the results of operations as well as those components presented as a percent of net revenues, for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis.\nWe acquired Foam Fabricators in February 2018, Velocity Outdoor in June 2017, 5.11 in August 2016 and our Sterno business acquired Rimports in February 2018. In the following results of operations, we provide (i) our actual Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, which includes the historical results of operations of each of our businesses (operating segments) from the date of acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and (ii) comparative historical components of the results of operations for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis ( Results of Operations - Our Businesses\u201d), for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, where all years presented include relevant pro-forma adjustments for pre-acquisition periods and explanations where applicable. For the 2018 acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased these businesses on January 1, 2017. The historical operating results of Rimports have been added to the previously reported Sterno results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Sterno results of operations for the 2018 period prior to acquisition by Sterno. For the 2017 acquisition of Velocity Outdoor and the 2016 acquisition of 5.11, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased these businesses on January 1, 2016. We believe this presentation enhances the discussion and provides a more meaningful comparison of operating results. The following operating results of our businesses are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, going forward.\nAll dollar amounts in the financial tables are presented in thousands.

Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $113.4 million and $145.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue, while our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor in June 2017 contributed $52.9 million to the increase, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018. We also saw notable sales increases at Clean\nEarth ($55.7 million), 5.11 ($37.9 million), Manitoba ($11.7 million), Arnold ($12.3 million) and our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports ($9.4 million). These increases in revenue were partially offset by decreases in net revenue at Liberty ($9.3 million) and Ergo ($12.4 million) in 2018 as compared to 2017. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of net revenue by business segment.\nWe do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and, in some cases, dividends on our equity ownership. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated.\nCost of revenues\nOn a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately $295.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $82.6 million and $110.5 million, respectively, to the increase in cost of revenues, while our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor in June 2017 contributed $35.3 million to the increase, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018. Clean Earth's cost of revenue increased $41.4 million, in line with the increase in revenues during 2018, while our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports had an increase in cost of revenues of $9.3 million, Manitoba Harvest ($8.0 million) and Arnold had an increase in cost of revenues of $8.6 million, both in line with the increase in revenues at these entities. These increases were offset by decreases in cost of revenues at other operating segments, particularly Ergo ($3.1 million decrease) and Liberty ($3.3 million decrease).\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 33.9% in year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 35.3% in 2017. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately $74.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase in expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 is principally the result of the acquisition of Foam Fabricators ($12.3 million including $1.6 million in acquisition costs), Rimports ($4.0 million, including $0.6 million in acquisition costs) and Velocity Outdoor ($10.4 million) reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018 and acquisition costs related to Ravin of $1.4 million. We also saw notable increases in selling, general and administrative year-over-year at 5.11 ($22.2 million) and Clean Earth ($10.8 million). Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense increased from $12.7 million in 2017 to $14.3 million in 2018, primarily due to increased professional fees associated with governance and compliance costs related to the implementation of new accounting standards.\nFees to manager\nPursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred approximately $44.3 million in expense for these fees compared to"}
