MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Overview\nWe provide a wide range of well site services to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies, including completion and remedial services, fluid services, well servicing and contract drilling services. Our results of operations reflect the impact of our acquisition strategy as a leading consolidator in the domestic land-based well services industry. Our acquisitions during 2014 and 2015 increased our breadth of service offerings at the well site and expanded our market presence. Our hydraulic horsepower capacity for pumping services increased from 291,000 at January 1, 2014 to 444,000 at December 31, 2016. Our weighted average number of fluid service trucks decreased from 1,006 in the first quarter of 2014 to 944 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our weighted average number of well servicing rigs decreased from 425 in the first quarter of 2014 to 421 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our weighted average number of drilling rigs remained constant at 12 from the first quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOur operating revenues from each of our segments, and their relative percentages of our total revenues, consisted of the following (dollars in millions):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Completion and remedial services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>698.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fluid services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well servicing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>547.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>805.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,491.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur core businesses depend on our customers' willingness to make expenditures to produce, develop and explore for oil and natural gas in the United States. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry, and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity, has adversely impacted the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers. This volatility also affected the demand for our services and the price of our services in 2016. In addition, the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have an impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices. For a more comprehensive discussion of our industry trends, see General Industry Overview\u201d included in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting production from existing oil and natural gas operations. Demand for these production-related services, including well servicing and fluid services, tends to remain relatively stable, even in moderate oil and natural gas price environments, as ongoing maintenance spending is required to sustain production. As oil and natural gas prices reach higher levels, demand for all of our services generally increases as our customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production from those wells. Because our services are required to support drilling and workover activities, our revenues will vary based on changes in capital spending by our customers as oil and natural gas prices increase or decrease.\nOil prices had remained relatively stable until the fourth quarter of 2014 when an extended period of significant decline began. The downward trend in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 has caused utilization and pricing for our services in our operating areas to decline throughout 2015. An extended period of lower pricing caused overcapacity and continued pricing pressure on all service lines in 2016.\nOur revenues generally increased in 2014 due to an increase in activity during the first nine months the year. This increase was most notable in our completion and remedial services segment, due to significant amount of capital expansion during the first half of the year. These increases were somewhat offset by the drop in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continued to decline throughout 2015 and stayed low all throughout 2016. Oil prices increased gradually in the fourth quarter of 2016, upon decisions by Saudi Arabia and OPEC to limit production. We anticipate our customer base to increase their 2017 capital programs and, as a result, expect modestly higher activity levels and pricing in 2017.\nWe will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our business through selective acquisitions and internal growth initiatives. Our capital investment decisions are determined by an analysis of the projected return on capital employed of each of those alternatives, which is substantially driven by the cost to acquire existing assets from a third party, the capital required to\nbuild new equipment and the point in the oil and natural gas commodity price cycle. Based on these factors, we make capital investment decisions that we believe will support our long-term growth strategy. While we believe our costs of integration for prior acquisitions have been reflected in our historical results of operations, integration of acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention.\nWe believe the most important performance measures for our business segments are as follows:\n\u2022Completion and Remedial Services - segment profits as a percent of revenues;\n\u2022Fluid Services - trucking hours, revenue per truck, segment profits per truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues;\n\u2022Well Servicing - rig hours, rig utilization rate, revenue per rig hour, profits per rig hour and segment profits as a percent of revenues; and\n\u2022Contract Drilling - rig operating days, revenue per drilling day, profits per drilling day and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nSegment profits are computed as segment operating revenues less direct operating costs. These measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business. For a detailed analysis of these indicators for our company, see Segment Overview\u201d below.\nRecent Strategic Acquisitions and Expansions\nDuring the period from 2014 through 2015, we grew through acquisitions and capital expenditures. We completed one acquisition in 2014 and three acquisitions in 2015 none of which were considered significant.\nSelected 2014 Acquisitions\nDuring 2014, we made one acquisition that complemented our existing completion and remedial services business segment. On September 17, 2014, we acquired all of the assets of Pioneer Fishing and Rental, Inc. for total cash consideration of $16.1 million. This acquisition is included in our completion and remedial services segment.\nSelected 2015 Acquisitions\nDuring 2015, we made three acquisitions that complemented our existing business segments, including GreyRock Pressure Pumping, LLC. On August 31, 2015, we acquired all of the assets of GreyRock Pressure Pumping, LLC, for total cash consideration of $10.2 million. This acquisition is included in our completion and remedial services segment.\nSegment Overview\nCompletion and Remedial Services\nIn 2016, our completion and remedial services segment represented 34% of our revenues. Revenues from our completion and remedial services segment are derived from a variety of services designed to stimulate oil and natural gas production or place cement slurry within the wellbores. Our completion and remedial services segment includes pumping services, rental and fishing tool operations, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, cased-hole wireline services, snubbing and underbalanced drilling.\nOur pumping services concentrate on providing single truck, lower-horsepower cementing and acidizing services, as well as various fracturing services in selected markets. Our total hydraulic horsepower capacity for our pumping services was approximately 444,000 horsepower at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nOur rental and fishing tool business operates 16 rental and fishing tool stores in selected markets as of December 31, 2016.\nOur snubbing services operate 36 units throughout our geographic footprint as of December 31, 2016.\nWe have operations in the wireline, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, water treatment and the underbalanced drilling services businesses. For a description of our wireline, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, water treatment, and snubbing operations, please read Overview of Our Segments and Services - Completion and Remedial Services Segment\u201d included in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn this segment, we derive our revenues on a project-by-project basis in a competitive bidding process. Our bids are based on the amount and type of equipment and personnel required, with the materials consumed billed separately. During periods of decreased spending by oil and gas companies, we may be required to discount our rates to remain competitive, which would cause lower segment profits.\nThe following is an analysis of our completion and remedial services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Completion & Remedial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profits %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$137,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$164,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$193,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$203,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$698,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$112,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$69,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$67,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$58,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$307,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$39,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$36,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$49,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$59,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$184,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe gauge the performance of our completion and remedial services segment based on the segment's operating revenues and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nFluid Services\nIn 2016, our fluid services segment represented 35% of our revenues. Revenues in our fluid services segment are earned from the sale, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids used in the drilling, production and maintenance of oil and natural gas wells. Revenues also include water treatment, well site construction and maintenance services. The fluid services segment has a base level of business consisting of transporting and disposing of salt water produced as a by-product of the production of oil and natural gas. These services are necessary for our customers and have a stable demand but typically produce lower relative segment profits than other parts of our fluid services segment. Fluid services for completion and workover projects typically require fresh or brine water for making drilling mud, circulating fluids or fracturing fluids used during a job, and all of these fluids require storage tanks and hauling and disposal. Because we can provide a full complement of fluid sales, trucking, storage and disposal required on most drilling and workover projects, the add-on services associated with drilling and workover activity enable us to generate higher segment profits. The higher segment profits are due to the relatively small incremental labor costs associated with providing these services in addition to our base fluid services operations. Revenues from our well site construction services are derived primarily from preparing and maintaining access roads and well locations, installing small diameter gathering lines and pipelines, constructing foundations to support drilling rigs and providing maintenance services for oil and natural gas facilities. Revenue from water treatment services results from the treatment and reselling of produced water and flowback to customers for the purposes of reusing as fracturing water. We typically price fluid services by the job, by the hour or by the quantities sold, disposed of or hauled.\nThe following is an analysis of our fluid services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue Per\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment Profits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Fluid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fluid Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Fluid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fluid Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Service Trucks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Truck Hours\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Truck\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Service Truck\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profits %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>607,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>645,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>661,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,545,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>595,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>565,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>557,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,291,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,999,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe gauge activity levels and profitability in our fluid services segment based on trucking hours, revenue per fluid service truck, segment profits per fluid service truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nWell Servicing\nIn 2016, our well servicing segment represented 30% of our revenues. Revenue in our well servicing segment is derived from maintenance, workover, completion and plugging and abandonment services, as well as rig manufacturing operations. We provide maintenance-related services as part of the normal, periodic upkeep of producing oil and natural gas wells. Maintenance-related services represent a relatively consistent component of our business. Workover and completion services generate more revenue per hour than maintenance work due to the use of auxiliary equipment, but demand for workover and completion services fluctuates more with the overall activity level in the industry.\nWe typically charge our well servicing rig customers for services on an hourly basis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required, market conditions in the region in which the rig operates, the ancillary equipment provided on the rig and the necessary personnel. We measure the activity level of our well servicing rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a 55-hour work week per rig.\nWe acquired our rig manufacturing business in May 2010. We manufacture workover rigs for internal purposes as well as to sell to outside companies. Our rig manufacturing operation also performs large scale refurbishments and maintenance services to used workover rigs.\nThe following is an analysis of our well servicing segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Revenues from our contract drilling segment are derived primarily from the drilling of new wells.\nWithin this segment, we typically charge our drilling rig customers a daily rate or a rate based on footage at an established rate per number of feet drilled. Depending on the type of job, we may also charge by the project. We measure the activity level of our drilling rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a seven-day work week per rig.\nThe following is an analysis of our contract drilling segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rig\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract Drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>of Rigs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Day\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Day\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profits %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$17,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$15,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$15,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-$600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$20,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$17,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$17,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe gauge activity levels and profitability in our drilling operations based on rig operating days, revenue per drilling day, profits per drilling day and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nOperating Cost Overview\nOur operating costs are comprised primarily of labor costs, including workers' compensation and health insurance, repair and maintenance, fuel and insurance. A majority of our employees are paid on an hourly basis. We also employ personnel to supervise our activities, sell our services and perform maintenance on our fleet. These costs are not directly tied to our level of business activity. Repair and maintenance is performed by our crews, company maintenance personnel and outside service providers. Insurance is generally a fixed cost regardless of utilization and can vary depending on the number of rigs, trucks and other equipment in our fleet, as well as employee payroll, and our safety record. Compensation for administrative personnel in local operating yards and our corporate office is accounted for as general and administrative expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. We have identified below accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 5. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost, or at estimated fair value at acquisition date if acquired in a business combination. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We also review the capitalization of refurbishment of workover rigs as described in Note 5. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairments. We review our assets including tangible assets, intangible assets and goodwill, for impairment at a minimum annually, or whenever, in management's judgment, events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recovered over its remaining service life. Impairment is indicated when the sum of the estimated\nfuture cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, is less than the asset's carrying amount. When impairment is identified and fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded to income based on an estimate of future cash flows on a discounted basis.\nSelf-Insured Risk Accruals. We are self-insured up to retention limits with regard to workers' compensation, general liability claims, and medical and dental coverage of our employees. We generally maintain no physical property damage coverage on our rig fleet, with the exception of certain rigs, newly manufactured rigs and pumping services equipment. We have deductibles per occurrence for workers' compensation, auto & general liability claims, and medical and dental coverage of $5 million, $1 million, and $400,000, respectively. We maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self-insurance retentions by using third-party actuarial data and claims history.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenues when the services are performed, collection of the relevant receivables is probable, persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable. Rig manufacturing revenue is recognized by individual rig based on the completed contract method.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will be more likely more than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.Based on this evaluation, as of December 31, 2016, a valuation allowance of approximately $189.2 million has been recorded on the net deferred tax assets for all federal and state tax jurisdictions in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized. The valuation allowance is recognized as a result of the Company being in a cumulative three year pre-tax book loss position and absence of other objectively verifiable positive evidence including reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in federal and state tax jurisdictions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. We analyze our estimates based on experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ from such estimates. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates.\nDepreciation and Amortization. In order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment and our intangible assets with finite lives, we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of these items. Our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry.\nImpairment of Property and Equipment. We analyze the potential impairment of property and equipment annually as of December 31 or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair values of the assets have decreased below the carrying value. Our analysis for potential impairment of property and equipment requires us to estimate undiscounted future cash flows. Actual impairment charges are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows. The determination of future cash flows requires us to estimate rates and utilization in future periods and such estimates can change based on market conditions, technological advances in industry or changes in regulations governing the industry.\nInventories. For rental and fishing tools, inventories consisting mainly of grapples, controls, and drill bits are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the average cost method. Other inventories, consisting mainly of manufacturing raw materials, rig components, repair parts, drilling and completion materials and gravel, are held for use in the operations of Basic and are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of past collection activity and specific identification of overdue accounts. Factors that may affect this estimate include (1) changes in the financial positions of significant customers and (2) a decline in commodity prices that could affect the entire customer base.\nLitigation and Self-Insured Risk Reserves. We estimate our reserves related to litigation and self-insured risk based on the facts and circumstances specific to the litigation and self-insured risk claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of litigation and insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. As discussed in Self-Insured Risk Accruals\u201d above with respect to our critical accounting policies, we maintain accruals on our balance sheet to cover self-insured retentions. These accruals are based on a third-party analysis developed using historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon reported claims and actual claim settlements.\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed. We estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, which involves the use of various assumptions. These estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. The most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most judgment, involve the estimated fair value of property and equipment, intangible assets and the resulting amount of goodwill, if any.\nCash Flow Estimates. Our estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent available market and operating data for the applicable asset or reporting unit at the time the estimate is made. Our cash flow estimates are used for asset impairment analyses.\nStock-Based Compensation. We have historically compensated our directors, executives and employees through the awarding of stock options and restricted stock. We accounted for stock option and restricted stock awards in 2016, 2015 and 2014 using a grant date fair-value based method, resulting in compensation expense for stock-based awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. For performance-based restricted stock awards, compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on their grant date fair value. We utilize (i) the closing stock price on the date of the grant to determine the fair value of vesting restricted stock awards and (ii) a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards with a combination of market and service vesting criteria. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award. The expected volatility utilized in the model was estimated using our historical volatility and the historical volatilities of our peer companies. The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. treasury rate for a term commensurate with the expected life of the grant. Stock options have not been issued since 2007 but were valued on the grant date using Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model and restricted stock issued is valued based on the fair value of our common stock at the grant date. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Because the determination of these various assumptions is subject to significant management judgment and different assumptions could result in material differences in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of stock options are critical.\nIncome Taxes. The amount and availability of our loss carryforwards (and certain other tax attributes) are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests. The utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or lost upon certain changes in ownership and the passage of time. Accordingly, although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us, no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards, or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future.\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations between periods may not be comparable, primarily due to fluctuations in the oil and natural gas industry throughout 2016, 2015 and 2014, as well as the Company's growth in asset base through capital expenditures during 2014. The asset base decreased in 2015 and 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues. Revenues decreased by 32% to $547.5 million in 2016 from $805.6 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in crude oil prices resulting in lower demand for our services by our customers, particularly from our completion and remedial services and contract drilling segments.\nCompletion and remedial services revenue decreased by 40% to $184.6 million in 2016 as compared to $307.6 million in 2015. The decrease in revenue between these periods was primarily due to lower pumping and fracturing revenues driven by the overall decrease in new well completion activity, as well as pricing concessions given to customers. Total hydraulic horsepower was approximately 444,000 at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nFluid services revenue decreased by 26% to $191.7 million in 2016 compared to $258.6 million in 2015. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in trucking hours and lower pricing for our services. Revenue per fluid service truck decreased 22% to $199,000 in 2016 compared to $254,000 in 2015, due to decreased disposal activities and lower pricing. Our weighted average number of fluid service trucks decreased to 966 in 2016 from 1,018 in 2015.\nWell servicing revenues decreased by 25% to $164.0 million in 2016 compared to $217.2 million in 2015. Rig utilization decreased to 42% in 2016 from 49% during 2015, reflecting lower activity levels and the competitive market in oil-dominated areas. Our weighted average number of well servicing rigs remained constant at 421 during 2016 and 2015. We experienced a decrease of 11% in revenue per rig hour to $310 during 2016 from $348 during 2015, due to pricing competition, especially from smaller service companies.\nContract drilling revenues decreased by 67% to $7.2 million in 2016 compared to $22.2 million in 2015. The decrease was driven mainly by a decrease in drilling activity, which caused a decline in rig operating days. The number of rig operating days decreased to 413 in 2016 compared to 1,361 in 2015. The average revenue per rig day increased to $17,500 in 2016 from $16,300 in 2015, due to improved utilization in the second half of 2016.\nDirect Operating Expenses. Direct operating expenses, which primarily consist of labor costs, including workers' compensation and health insurance, and maintenance and repair costs, decreased by 27% to $467.7 million in 2016 from $642.9 million in 2014. This decrease was due to the lower activity levels in all our segments.\nDirect operating expenses for the completion and remedial services segment decreased by 35% to $158.8 million in 2016 as compared to $245.1 million in 2015, due primarily to decreased activity levels and reduction in headcount. Segment profits decreased to 14% of revenues in 2016 compared to 20% in 2015, due to decremental margins on a lower revenue base in all operating areas as well as significant pricing discounts for our pumping services.\nDirect operating expenses for the fluid services segment decreased by 18% to $161.5 million in 2016 as compared to $196.2 million in 2015. Segment profits were 16% of revenues in 2016 and 24% of revenues in 2015, due to high levels of competition for trucking services and lower skim oil sales and disposal activity.\nDirect operating expenses for the well servicing segment decreased by 24% to $140.3 million in 2016 as compared to $185.0 million in 2015, due primarily to decreased personnel costs and reduced demand for our services. Segment profits remained constant at 14% of revenues in 2016 and 2015, with competitive pricing pressures and the impact of decremental margins on a lower revenue base impacting both years.\nDirect operating expenses for the contract drilling segment decreased by 58% to $7.1 million in 2016 as compared to $16.7 million in 2015, due to a significant decrease in the North American on-shore drilling rig count. Segment profits were 2% of revenues in 2016 compared to 25% in 2015, due to an overall decline in drilling activity.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by 5.7% to $135.3 million in 2016 from $143.5 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower payroll and incentive compensation costs due to a reduction in workforce in 2015, plus additional cost saving initiatives implemented in late 2014 and 2015. G&A expense included $17.7 million and $13.7 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nReorganization Costs. Reorganization costs consist of $20.7 million in 2016 related to pre-petition reorganization and bankruptcy related expenses including legal, accounting, and consulting fees.\nReorganization Items, Net. Reorganization Items, net were $264.3 million in 2016. Reorganization items primarily consist of $540.3 million gain on debt discharge partially offset by $220.5 million loss on fresh start accounting revaluations, $23.3 million write-off of deferred financing costs and debt premiums and discounts, and $19.7 million of post-petition professional fees incurred in connection with our emergence from voluntary reorganization, $8.5 million fair value of warrants issued, $1.4 million in Successor equity to Predecessor equity holders, and $2.8 million in other costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $218.2 million in 2016, as compared to $241.5 million in 2015, reflecting the increase in the size of and investment in our asset base during 2014. During 2016, we invested $32.7 million for cash capital expenditures and $5.7 million for capital leases.\nGoodwill Impairment. In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a non-cash charge totaling $646,000 for impairment of all of the goodwill associated with our 2015 acquisitions.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $96.6 million in 2016 compared to $68.0 million in 2015. The increase in interest expense in 2016 was primarily due to our new term and debtor-in-possession loan facilities.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Income tax benefit was $3.9 million and $131.3 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively. Our effective tax benefit rate was approximately 3.1% in 2016 compared to an effective tax benefit rate of 35.2% in 2015. The change in the effective tax rate is due to the deferred tax valuation allowances related to net operating loss carryforwards available to be used in future periods.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues. Revenues decreased by 46% to $805.6 million in 2015 from $1.5 billion in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in crude oil prices resulting in lower demand for our services by our customers, particularly from our completion and remedial services and contract drilling segments.\nCompletion and remedial services revenue decreased by 56% to $307.6 million in 2015 as compared to $698.9 million in 2014. The decrease in revenue between these periods was primarily due to lower pumping and fracturing revenues driven by the overall decrease in new well completion activity, as well as pricing concessions given to customers. Total hydraulic horsepower was approximately 444,000 and 443,000 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nFluid services revenue decreased by 30% to $258.6 million in 2015 compared to $369.8 million in 2014. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in trucking hours and lower pricing for our services. Revenue per fluid service truck decreased 30% to $254,000 in 2015 compared to $362,000 in 2014, due to decreased disposal activities and lower pricing. Our weighted average number of fluid service trucks decreased to 1,018 in 2015 from 1,022 in 2014.\nWell servicing revenues decreased by 40% to $217.2 million in 2015 compared to $361.7 million in 2014. Rig utilization decreased to 49% in 2015 from 71% during 2014, reflecting lower activity levels and the competitive market in oil-dominated areas. Our weighted average number of well servicing rigs decreased to 421 during 2015 compared to 422 in 2014 due to the sale of four barge rigs in the first quarter of 2014. We experienced a decrease of 16% in revenue per rig hour to $348 during 2015 from $412 during 2014, due to pricing competition, especially from smaller service companies.\nContract drilling revenues decreased by 64% to $22.2 million in 2015 compared to $60.9 million in 2014. The decrease was driven mainly by a decrease in drilling activity, which caused a decline in rig operating days. The number of rig operating days decreased to 1,361 in 2015 compared to 3,679 in 2014. The average revenue per rig day decreased to $16,300 in 2015 from $16,600 in 2014, due to pricing competition.\nDirect Operating Expenses. Direct operating expenses, which primarily consist of labor costs, including workers' compensation and health insurance, and maintenance and repair costs, decreased by 36% to $642.9 million in 2015 from $1.0 billion in 2014. This decrease was due to the lower activity levels in all our segments.\nDirect operating expenses for the completion and remedial services segment decreased by 44% to $245.1 million in 2015 as compared to $434.5 million in 2014, due primarily to decreased activity levels and reduction in headcount. Segment profits decreased to 20% of revenues in 2015 compared to 38% in 2014, due to decremental margins on a lower revenue base in all operating areas as well as significant pricing discounts for our pumping services.\nDirect operating expenses for the fluid services segment decreased by 26% to $196.2 million in 2015 as compared to $265.1 million in 2014. Segment profits were 24% of revenues in 2015 and 28% of revenues in 2014, due to high levels of competition for trucking services and lower skim oil sales and disposal activity.\nDirect operating expenses for the well servicing segment decreased by 32% to $185.0 million in 2015 as compared to $270.3 million in 2014, due primarily to decreased personnel costs and reduced demand for our services. Segment profits decreased to 15% of revenues in 2015 compared to 25% in 2014, due to competitive pricing pressures and the impact of decremental margins on a lower revenue base.\nDirect operating expenses for the contract drilling segment decreased by 60% to $16.7 million in 2015 as compared to $41.5 million in 2014, due to a significant decrease in the North American on-shore drilling rig count. Segment profits were 25% of revenues in 2015 compared to 32% in 2014, due to decline in drilling activity.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by 14% to $143.5 million in 2015 from $167.3 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower payroll and incentive compensation costs due to a reduction in workforce in 2015, plus additional cost saving initiatives implemented in late 2014 and 2015. G&A expense included $13.7 million and $14.7 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $241.5 million in 2015, as compared to $217.5 million in 2014, reflecting the increase in the size of and investment in our asset base during 2014. During 2015, we invested $56.9 million for cash capital expenditures, $16.0 million for capital leases and an additional $16.7 million for acquisitions.\nGoodwill Impairment. In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash charge totaling $81.9 million for impairment of all of the goodwill associated with our completion and remedial services segment.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense remained relatively flat at $68.0 million in 2015 compared to $67.0 million in 2014.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax benefit was $131.3 million in 2015, as compared to tax expense of $521,000 in 2014. Our effective tax benefit rate was approximately 35% in 2015 compared to an effective tax expense rate of 7% in 2014. The change in the effective tax rate is due to the tax impact associated with the impairment of goodwill in 2015 and 2014 and the impact of permanent items on a higher pre-tax loss amount in 2015. Our effective tax benefit in 2015 approximates the federal statutory rate of 35%. The 2014 effective tax rate of 7% differed from the statutory tax rate due to state taxes and goodwill impairment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCurrently, our primary capital resources are net cash flows from our operations, utilization of capital leases and our $75.0 million revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $98.9 million compared to $46.7 million as of December 31, 2015. We have utilized, and expect to utilize in the future, bank and capital lease financing and sales of equity to obtain capital resources. When appropriate, we will consider public or private debt and equity offerings and non-recourse transactions to meet our liquidity needs.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. This assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Management believes the implementation of the Prepackaged Plan and our emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings on the Effective Date have resolved the substantial doubt and the related uncertainty about our application of the going concern basis of accounting.\nCancellation of Indebtedness\nOn February 15, 2011, we issued $275.0 million aggregated principal amount of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes\u201d). On June 13, 2011, we issued an additional $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes, resulting in outstanding 2019 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $475.0 million. On October 16, 2012, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes,\u201d and together with the 2019 Notes, the Unsecured Notes\u201d). In connection with the Prepackaged Plan, on the Effective Date, all of the Unsecured Notes were cancelled and discharged, along with associated accrued interest amounts pursuant to the Prepackaged Plan.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash flow used in operating activities was $151.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to cash provided by operations of $95.5 million in 2015 and $224.5 million in 2014. The decrease in 2016 was due primarily to a decrease in operating income offset by an increase in working capital. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in operating income and an increase in accounts receivable.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures are the main component of our investing activities. Cash capital expenditures (including acquisitions) for 2016 were $32.7 million as compared to $70.6 million in 2015, and $252.4 million in 2014. Cash capital expenditures decreased in 2016 from 2015 due to a decrease in expansionary capital expenditures to $5.0 million in 2016 from $21.4 million in 2015. Through our capital lease program, we also added assets of approximately $5.7 million, $16.0 million and $75.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn 2017, we have currently planned capital expenditures of approximately $115.0 million including capital leases of $70.0 million. We do not budget acquisitions in the normal course of business, and we regularly engage in discussions related to potential acquisitions related to the well services industry.\nCapital Resources and Financing\nOur current primary capital resources are cash flow from our operations, our $75.0 million revolving credit facility, and the ability to enter into capital leases, the ability to incur additional secured indebtedness, and a cash balance of $98.9 million at December 31, 2016. We had no borrowings and $51.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Second A&R Credit Agreement as defined below, as of December 31, 2016, giving us $23.4 million of available borrowing capacity. In 2016, we financed activities in excess of cash flow from operations primarily through the use of bank debt and capital leases. The A&R Term Loan Agreement had $164.2 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of loans as of December 31, 2016 and no additional borrowing capacity. See -Second A&R Revolving Credit Facility\u201dand -Term Loan Agreement\u201d below.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have significant contractual obligations in the future that will require capital resources. Our primary contractual obligations are (1) our capital leases, (2) our operating leases, (3) our asset retirement obligations and (4) our other long-term liabilities. The following table outlines our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Obligations Due in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Periods Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018-2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan Credit Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur long-term debt as of December 31, 2016, excluding capital leases, consisted of $164.2 million under our Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement. Interest on long-term debt relates to our future contractual interest obligations under our Amended and Restated Term Loan agreement. Our capital leases relate primarily to light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles and trailers. Our operating leases relate primarily to real estate. Our asset retirement obligation relates to disposal wells.\nOur ability to access additional sources of financing will be dependent on our operating cash flows and demand for our services, which could be negatively impacted due to the extreme volatility of commodity prices.\nSecond Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility\nOn November 26, 2014, we entered into an amended and restated $300.0 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders. On the Effective Date, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders, a collateral management agent, the swing line lender and an letter of credit issuer. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as a collateral management agent and syndication agent, and the financial institutions party thereto, as lenders (the \"Second A&R Credit Agreement\")\nThe Second A&R Credit Agreement provides for a $75 million revolving credit loan facility with a $65 million letter of credit sublimit and $10 million swing line sublimit. The obligations under the Second A&R Credit Agreement are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of our current subsidiaries, other than our immaterial subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of our and our guarantors' assets as collateral under the Third Amended and Restated Security Agreement dated as of the Effective Date (the Security Agreement\u201d).\nBorrowings under the Second A&R Credit Agreement will mature on December 23, 2019. The Second A&R Credit Agreement requires Basic to repay to the lenders the aggregate principal amount of all revolving credit loans on the Effective Date. The Company may voluntarily prepay loans under the Second A&R Credit Agreement, subject to customary notice requirements and minimum prepayment amounts. Basic must prepay loans under the Second A&R Credit Agreement if, for any reason, the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans and letter of credit obligations at any time exceed the borrowing base at such time. In this event, Basic must immediately prepay revolving credit loans, swing line loans and letter of credit borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to the excess.\nLoans under the Second A&R Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate equal to either (i) the London interbank offered rate (the Eurodollar Rate\u201d) plus a rate of 2.5% to 4.5% depending on the consolidated leverage ratio at the time of the determination or (ii) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50%, (b) the prime rate then in effect publicly announced by Bank of America and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%, the highest is then is added to a rate ranging from 1.5% to 3.5% depending on the consolidated leverage ratio at the time of the determination.\nThe Second A&R Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, subject to agreed upon exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022incur indebtedness;\n\u2022grant liens;\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022make loans, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022change the nature of business;\n\u2022acquire or sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022declare or pay dividends;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022enter into burdensome agreements;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or modify or terminate other indebtedness;\n\u2022change accounting policies and reporting practices;\n\u2022amend organizational documents; and\n\u2022use proceeds to fund any activities of or business with any person that is the subject of governmental sanctions.\nThe Second A&R Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Second A&R Credit Agreement further requires that Basic maintain a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Second A&R Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 for any time period during which a Financial Covenant Trigger Period (as defined in the Second A&R Credit Agreement) is in effect.\nIf an event of default occurs under the Second A&R Credit Agreement, then the lenders may (i) terminate their commitments under the Second A&R Credit Agreement, (ii) declare any outstanding loans under the Second A&R Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, (iii) require that we cash collateralize our letter of credit obligations and (iv) foreclose on the collateral secured by the Security Agreement.\nWe had no borrowings and $51.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Second A&R Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2016, giving us $23.4 million of available borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our covenants under the Second A&R Credit Agreement.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn February 17, 2016, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Original Term Loan Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders and U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent for the lenders. The Original Term Loan Agreement included two categories of borrowings: (a) the closing date term loan borrowings in an aggregate amount of $165.0 million, and (b) the delayed draw term loan borrowings in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $ 15.0 million. The making of the term loans under the Original Term Loan Agreement was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including, with respect to the delayed draw term loans, the consent of the lenders providing the delayed draw term loans. On the Effective Date, we entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of lenders and U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent for the lenders, which amended and restated the Original Term Loan Agreement. Under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement, on the Effective Date, (i) the outstanding principal amount of pre-petition term loans of each pre-petition term lender were exchanged for loans under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement in an amount equal to such pre-petition term lender's aggregate outstanding principal\namount of pre-petition term loans as of the Effective Date, as determined immediately prior to such exchange and (ii) all accrued and unpaid interest on such pre-petition term loans as of the Effective Date are deemed to be accrued and unpaid interest on the loans. Following such exchange, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the loans under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement was $164,175,000.\nBorrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement will mature on February 26, 2021 unless, such date is not a business day, in which case the borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement will mature on the next preceding business day. We may voluntarily prepay the loans under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement in whole or in part without premium or penalty, provided that certain conditions set forth therein are met. We are required to prepay the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement in the case of a change of control, certain sales of our assets, certain issuances of indebtedness and under certain other circumstances, in which case such prepayment may be subject to an applicable premium.\nEach loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to 13.50%. In addition, we will be responsible for the applicable lenders' fees, including a closing payment equal to 7.00% of the aggregate principal amount of commitments of each lender under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement as of the effective date, and administrative agent fees.\nThe Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement contains various covenants that, subject to agreed upon exceptions, limit Basic's ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022incur indebtedness;\n\u2022grant liens;\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022make loans, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022change the nature of business;\n\u2022acquire or sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022declare or pay dividends;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022enter into burdensome agreements;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or modify or terminate other indebtedness;\n\u2022change accounting policies and reporting practices;\n\u2022amend organizational documents; and\n\u2022use proceeds to fund any activities of or business with any person that is the subject of governmental sanctions.\nIf an event of default occurs under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement, then the term loan administrative agent may, with the consent of the required lenders , or shall, at the direction of, the required lenders, (i) declare any outstanding loans under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement to be immediately due and payable, and (ii) exercise on behalf of itself and the lenders all rights and remedies available to it and the lenders under the applicable loan documents or applicable law or equity. The default rate under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement is 16.50% per annum.\nOn the Effective Date, Basic entered into an Amended and Restated Security Agreement with certain of its subsidiaries and the term loan administrative agent (the Term Loan Security Agreement\u201d). The collateral under the Term Loan Security Agreement includes (as defined therein): (a) all Chattel Paper, all Collateral Accounts, all commercial tort claims, all Contracts, all Deposit Accounts, all Documents, all Equipment, all Fixtures, all General Intangibles, all Instruments, all Intellectual Property, all Inventory, all Investment Property (including without limitation the Pledged Equity and all Securities Accounts), all Letter of Credit Rights, all Liquid Assets, all Receivables, all Records, and all Supporting Obligations; (b) any and all additions, accessions and improvements to, all substitutions and replacements for and all products of or derived from the foregoing; and (c) all Proceeds of the foregoing. Under mortgages and deeds of trust, Basic and certain of its subsidiaries previously granted to the term loan administrative agent liens on a substantial portion of their real properties to secure Basic's obligations under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement of the Company in effect at the time of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. These liens continue to secure the obligations of Basic under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement. Basic has also agreed to provide to the term loan administrative agent liens on additional real properties, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our covenants under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement.\nDIP Facility\nOn October 27, 2016, in connection with the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company and its debtor subsidiaries entered into the Superpriority Secured Debtor-in-Possession Term Loan Credit Agreement (the DIP Facility\u201d) with U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The DIP Facility included commitments from the lenders thereto to provide delayed draw term loans of up to $90.0 million. The Company drew $30.0 million from the DIP Facility after the Court entered its order approving the DIP Facility. Borrowings under the DIP Facility were paid in full on or prior to the Effective Date. The DIP Facility provided the Company with interim financing during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and terminated as of the Effective Date.\nOther Debt\nWe have a variety of other capital leases and notes payable outstanding that are customary in our business. None of these debt instruments are individually material. Our leases with Bank of America Leasing & Capital, LLC require us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.05 to 1.00. There is a minimum liquidity covenant requiring unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balances to be at or above $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had total capital leases of approximately $70.3 million.\nPreferred Stock\nAt December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had 5,000,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock authorized, of which none was designated, issued or outstanding.\nOther Matters\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nNet Operating Losses\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $567.5 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards. Based on the weight of all available evidence including the future reversal of existing U.S. taxable temporary differences as of December 31, 2016, we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $189.2 million on the net deferred tax asset as a result of the company being in a cumulative three year pre-tax book loss position and absence of other objectively verifiable positive evidence including reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in these certain state tax jurisdictions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently adopted\nIn August, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d which requires management to assess a company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Under the new standard, disclosures are required when conditions give rise to substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date. The Update applies to all companies and is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter. Basic has adopted this pronouncement, which resulted in additional disclosures which have been included in Note 2. Going Concern, to these consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\u201d ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Basic has adopted this pronouncement, which resulted in a reclassification of deferred debt costs related to long-term debt from an asset to an offset of the related liability. The adoption of the ASU did not affect our method of amortizing debt issuance costs, and will not affect the statement of operations.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.\u201d The main provision of this Update is to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position. This Update is effective for Basic in annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, however early adoption is permitted. Basic has elected to adopt this ASU beginning in the interim period ended March 31, 2016, and retrospectively for all periods presented. See Note: 14 for discussion of Basic's adoption of this Update.\nNot yet adopted\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d The purpose of this Update to is to simplify overly complex areas of GAAP, while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This Update is effective for Basic in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\u201d to simplify the measurement of inventory, which requires inventory measured using the first in, first out (FIFO) or average cost methods to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal and transportation. Currently, these inventory methods are required to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or market. \"Market\" could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. This update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and will be applied prospectively. Basic has evaluated this new accounting standard and determined it will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers-Deferral of the Effective Date,\u201d that defers by one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" represented a comprehensive revenue recognition standard to supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and align GAAP more closely with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nThe core principle of the new guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to match the delivery of goods or services to customers to the consideration the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard creates a five step model that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering the terms of a contract and all relevant facts and circumstances. The standard allows for several transition methods: (a) a full retrospective adoption in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or (b) a modified retrospective adoption in which the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements, including additional disclosures of the standard's application impact to individual financial statement line items.\nWe are currently determining the impact of the new standard on the revenue streams from the services we provide. Our approach includes performing a detailed review of key contracts representative of our different businesses and comparing historical accounting policies and practices to the new standard. Our services are primarily short-term in nature, and our assessment at this stage is that we do not expect the new revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption. We currently intend to adopt the new standard as of January 1, 2018.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\u201d The purpose of this Update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This Update is effective for Basic in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Basic is in the process of determining if this pronouncement will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\" This standard is effective for Basic for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this update are intended to clarify cash flow treatment of certain cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Basic intends to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2018, and does not expect significant changes to the cash flow statement as a result.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.\" Under current U.S. GAAP, the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer is prohibited until the asset has been sold to an outside party. Under the new standard, an entity will recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Basic is in the process of determining the\nwhether this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn November 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-18- \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\" which clarifies the treatment of cash inflows into and cash payments from restricted cash. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents and are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The amendments in this ASU require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. GAAP currently does not include specific guidance on the cash flow classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents for public entities. The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows, thereby reducing the diversity in practice described above.\nThe amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Basic intends to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2018, and does not expect significant changes to the cash flow statement as a result.\nImpact of Inflation on Operations\nInflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it is still a factor in the U.S. economy, and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of our equipment, materials and supplies as increasing oil and natural gas prices also increase activity in our areas of operations.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a company's operations in the oil and natural gas industry, showcasing its well site services and acquisition strategy.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Overview\nWe provide a wide range of well site services to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies, including completion and remedial services, fluid services, well servicing and contract drilling services. Our results of operations reflect the impact of our acquisition strategy as a leading consolidator in the domestic land-based well services industry. Our acquisitions during 2014 and 2015 increased our breadth of service offerings at the well site and expanded our market presence. Our hydraulic horsepower capacity for pumping services increased from 291,000 at January 1, 2014 to 444,000 at December 31, 2016. Our weighted average number of fluid service trucks decreased from 1,006 in the first quarter of 2014 to 944 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our weighted average number of well servicing rigs decreased from 425 in the first quarter of 2014 to 421 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our weighted average number of drilling rigs remained constant at 12 from the first quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOur operating revenues from each of our segments, and their relative percentages of our total revenues, consisted of the following (dollars in millions):\n\nOur core businesses depend on our customers' willingness to make expenditures to produce, develop and explore for oil and natural gas in the United States. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry, and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity, has adversely impacted the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers. This volatility also affected the demand for our services and the price of our services in 2016. In addition, the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have an impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices. For a more comprehensive discussion of our industry trends, see General Industry Overview\u201d included in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting production from existing oil and natural gas operations. Demand for these production-related services, including well servicing and fluid services, tends to remain relatively stable, even in moderate oil and natural gas price environments, as ongoing maintenance spending is required to sustain production. As oil and natural gas prices reach higher levels, demand for all of our services generally increases as our customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production from those wells. Because our services are required to support drilling and workover activities, our revenues will vary based on changes in capital spending by our customers as oil and natural gas prices increase or decrease.\nOil prices had remained relatively stable until the fourth quarter of 2014 when an extended period of significant decline began. The downward trend in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 has caused utilization and pricing for our services in our operating areas to decline throughout 2015. An extended period of lower pricing caused overcapacity and continued pricing pressure on all service lines in 2016.\nOur revenues generally increased in 2014 due to an increase in activity during the first nine months the year. This increase was most notable in our completion and remedial services segment, due to significant amount of capital expansion during the first half of the year. These increases were somewhat offset by the drop in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continued to decline throughout 2015 and stayed low all throughout 2016. Oil prices increased gradually in the fourth quarter of 2016, upon decisions by Saudi Arabia and OPEC to limit production. We anticipate our customer base to increase their 2017 capital programs and, as a result, expect modestly higher activity levels and pricing in 2017.\nWe will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our business through selective acquisitions and internal growth initiatives. Our capital investment decisions are determined by an analysis of the projected return on capital employed of each of those alternatives, which is substantially driven by the cost to acquire existing assets from a third party, the capital required to\nbuild new equipment and the point in the oil and natural gas commodity price cycle. Based on these factors, we make capital investment decisions that we believe will support our long-term growth strategy. While we believe our costs of integration for prior acquisitions have been reflected in our historical results of operations, integration of acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention.\nWe believe the most important performance measures for our business segments are as follows:\n\u2022Completion and Remedial Services - segment profits as a percent of revenues;\n\u2022Fluid Services - trucking hours, revenue per truck, segment profits per truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues;\n\u2022Well Servicing - rig hours, rig utilization rate, revenue per rig hour, profits per rig hour and segment profits as a percent of revenues; and\n\u2022Contract Drilling - rig operating days, revenue per drilling day, profits per drilling day and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nSegment profits are computed as segment operating revenues less direct operating costs. These measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business. For a detailed analysis of these indicators for our company, see Segment Overview\u201d below.\nRecent Strategic Acquisitions and Expansions\nDuring the period from 2014 through 2015, we grew through acquisitions and capital expenditures. We completed one acquisition in 2014 and three acquisitions in 2015 none of which were considered significant.\nSelected 2014 Acquisitions\nDuring 2014, we made one acquisition that complemented our existing completion and remedial services business segment. On September 17, 2014, we acquired all of the assets of Pioneer Fishing and Rental, Inc. for total cash consideration of $16.1 million. This acquisition is included in our completion and remedial services segment.\nSelected 2015 Acquisitions\nDuring 2015, we made three acquisitions that complemented our existing business segments, including GreyRock Pressure Pumping, LLC. On August 31, 2015, we acquired all of the assets of GreyRock Pressure Pumping, LLC, for total cash consideration of $10.2 million. This acquisition is included in our completion and remedial services segment.\nSegment Overview\nCompletion and Remedial Services\nIn 2016, our completion and remedial services segment represented 34% of our revenues. Revenues from our completion and remedial services segment are derived from a variety of services designed to stimulate oil and natural gas production or place cement slurry within the wellbores. Our completion and remedial services segment includes pumping services, rental and fishing tool operations, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, cased-hole wireline services, snubbing and underbalanced drilling.\nOur pumping services concentrate on providing single truck, lower-horsepower cementing and acidizing services, as well as various fracturing services in selected markets. Our total hydraulic horsepower capacity for our pumping services was approximately 444,000 horsepower at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nOur rental and fishing tool business operates 16 rental and fishing tool stores in selected markets as of December 31, 2016.\nOur snubbing services operate 36 units throughout our geographic footprint as of December 31, 2016.\nWe have operations in the wireline, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, water treatment and the underbalanced drilling services businesses. For a description of our wireline, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, water treatment, and snubbing operations, please read Overview of Our Segments and Services - Completion and Remedial Services Segment\u201d included in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn this segment, we derive our revenues on a project-by-project basis in a competitive bidding process. Our bids are based on the amount and type of equipment and personnel required, with the materials consumed billed separately. During periods of decreased spending by oil and gas companies, we may be required to discount our rates to remain competitive, which would cause lower segment profits.\nThe following is an analysis of our completion and remedial services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\nWe gauge the performance of our completion and remedial services segment based on the segment's operating revenues and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nFluid Services\nIn 2016, our fluid services segment represented 35% of our revenues. Revenues in our fluid services segment are earned from the sale, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids used in the drilling, production and maintenance of oil and natural gas wells. Revenues also include water treatment, well site construction and maintenance services. The fluid services segment has a base level of business consisting of transporting and disposing of salt water produced as a by-product of the production of oil and natural gas. These services are necessary for our customers and have a stable demand but typically produce lower relative segment profits than other parts of our fluid services segment. Fluid services for completion and workover projects typically require fresh or brine water for making drilling mud, circulating fluids or fracturing fluids used during a job, and all of these fluids require storage tanks and hauling and disposal. Because we can provide a full complement of fluid sales, trucking, storage and disposal required on most drilling and workover projects, the add-on services associated with drilling and workover activity enable us to generate higher segment profits. The higher segment profits are due to the relatively small incremental labor costs associated with providing these services in addition to our base fluid services operations. Revenues from our well site construction services are derived primarily from preparing and maintaining access roads and well locations, installing small diameter gathering lines and pipelines, constructing foundations to support drilling rigs and providing maintenance services for oil and natural gas facilities. Revenue from water treatment services results from the treatment and reselling of produced water and flowback to customers for the purposes of reusing as fracturing water. We typically price fluid services by the job, by the hour or by the quantities sold, disposed of or hauled.\nThe following is an analysis of our fluid services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\nWe gauge activity levels and profitability in our fluid services segment based on trucking hours, revenue per fluid service truck, segment profits per fluid service truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nWell Servicing\nIn 2016, our well servicing segment represented 30% of our revenues. Revenue in our well servicing segment is derived from maintenance, workover, completion and plugging and abandonment services, as well as rig manufacturing operations. We provide maintenance-related services as part of the normal, periodic upkeep of producing oil and natural gas wells. Maintenance-related services represent a relatively consistent component of our business. Workover and completion services generate more revenue per hour than maintenance work due to the use of auxiliary equipment, but demand for workover and completion services fluctuates more with the overall activity level in the industry.\nWe typically charge our well servicing rig customers for services on an hourly basis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required, market conditions in the region in which the rig operates, the ancillary equipment provided on the rig and the necessary personnel. We measure the activity level of our well servicing rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a 55-hour work week per rig.\nWe acquired our rig manufacturing business in May 2010. We manufacture workover rigs for internal purposes as well as to sell to outside companies. Our rig manufacturing operation also performs large scale refurbishments and maintenance services to used workover rigs.\nThe following is an analysis of our well servicing segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The revenue per rig hour does not include revenues associated with rig manufacturing operations:\n\nWe gauge activity levels and profitability in our well servicing rig operations based on rig hours, rig utilization rate, revenue per rig hour, profits per rig hour and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nContract Drilling\nIn 2016, our contract drilling segment represented 1% of our revenues. Revenues from our contract drilling segment are derived primarily from the drilling of new wells.\nWithin this segment, we typically charge our drilling rig customers a daily rate or a rate based on footage at an established rate per number of feet drilled. Depending on the type of job, we may also charge by the project. We measure the activity level of our drilling rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a seven-day work week per rig.\nThe following is an analysis of our contract drilling segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nWe gauge activity levels and profitability in our drilling operations based on rig operating days, revenue per drilling day, profits per drilling day and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nOperating Cost Overview\nOur operating costs are comprised primarily of labor costs, including workers' compensation and health insurance, repair and maintenance, fuel and insurance. A majority of our employees are paid on an hourly basis. We also employ personnel to supervise our activities, sell our services and perform maintenance on our fleet. These costs are not directly tied to our level of business activity. Repair and maintenance is performed by our crews, company maintenance personnel and outside service providers. Insurance is generally a fixed cost regardless of utilization and can vary depending on the number of rigs, trucks and other equipment in our fleet, as well as employee payroll, and our safety record. Compensation for administrative personnel in local operating yards and our corporate office is accounted for as general and administrative expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. We have identified below accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 5. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost, or at estimated fair value at acquisition date if acquired in a business combination. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We also review the capitalization of refurbishment of workover rigs as described in Note 5. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairments. We review our assets including tangible assets, intangible assets and goodwill, for impairment at a minimum annually, or whenever, in management's judgment, events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recovered over its remaining service life. Impairment is indicated when the sum of the estimated\nfuture cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, is less than the asset's carrying amount. When impairment is identified and fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded to income based on an estimate of future cash flows on a discounted basis.\nSelf-Insured Risk Accruals. We are self-insured up to retention limits with regard to workers' compensation, general liability claims, and medical and dental coverage of our employees. We generally maintain no physical property damage coverage on our rig fleet, with the exception of certain rigs, newly manufactured rigs and pumping services equipment. We have deductibles per occurrence for workers' compensation, auto & general liability claims, and medical and dental coverage of $5 million, $1 million, and $400,000, respectively. We maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self-insurance retentions by using third-party actuarial data and claims history.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenues when the services are performed, collection of the relevant receivables is probable, persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable. Rig manufacturing revenue is recognized by individual rig based on the completed contract method.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will be more likely more than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.Based on this evaluation, as of December 31, 2016, a valuation allowance of approximately $189.2 million has been recorded on the net deferred tax assets for all federal and state tax jurisdictions in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized. The valuation allowance is recognized as a result of the Company being in a cumulative three year pre-tax book loss position and absence of other objectively verifiable positive evidence including reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in federal and state tax jurisdictions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. We analyze our estimates based on experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ from such estimates. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates.\nDepreciation and Amortization. In order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment and our intangible assets with finite lives, we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of these items. Our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry.\nImpairment of Property and Equipment. We analyze the potential impairment of property and equipment annually as of December 31 or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair values of the assets have decreased below the carrying value. Our analysis for potential impairment of property and equipment requires us to estimate undiscounted future cash flows. Actual impairment charges are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows. The determination of future cash flows requires us to estimate rates and utilization in future periods and such estimates can change based on market conditions, technological advances in industry or changes in regulations governing the industry.\nInventories. For rental and fishing tools, inventories consisting mainly of grapples, controls, and drill bits are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the average cost method. Other inventories, consisting mainly of manufacturing raw materials, rig components, repair parts, drilling and completion materials and gravel, are held for use in the operations of Basic and are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of past collection activity and specific identification of overdue accounts. Factors that may affect this estimate include (1) changes in the financial positions of significant customers and (2) a decline in commodity prices that could affect the entire customer base.\nLitigation and Self-Insured Risk Reserves. We estimate our reserves related to litigation and self-insured risk based on the facts and circumstances specific to the litigation and self-insured risk claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of litigation and insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. As discussed in Self-Insured Risk Accruals\u201d above with respect to our critical accounting policies, we maintain accruals on our balance sheet to cover self-insured retentions. These accruals are based on a third-party analysis developed using historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon reported claims and actual claim settlements.\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed. We estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, which involves the use of various assumptions. These estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. The most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most judgment, involve the estimated fair value of property and equipment, intangible assets and the resulting amount of goodwill, if any.\nCash Flow Estimates. Our estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent available market and operating data for the applicable asset or reporting unit at the time the estimate is made. Our cash flow estimates are used for asset impairment analyses.\nStock-Based Compensation. We have historically compensated our directors, executives and employees through the awarding of stock options and restricted stock. We accounted for stock option and restricted stock awards in 2016, 2015 and 2014 using a grant date fair-value based method, resulting in compensation expense for stock-based awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. For performance-based restricted stock awards, compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on their grant date fair value. We utilize (i) the closing stock price on the date of the grant to determine the fair value of vesting restricted stock awards and (ii) a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards with a combination of market and service vesting criteria. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award. The expected volatility utilized in the model was estimated using our historical volatility and the historical volatilities of our", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

These measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business. For a detailed analysis of these indicators for our company, see Segment Overview\u201d below.\nRecent Strategic Acquisitions and Expansions\nDuring the period from 2014 through 2015, we grew through acquisitions and capital expenditures. We completed one acquisition in 2014 and three acquisitions in 2015 none of which were considered significant.\nSelected 2014 Acquisitions\nDuring 2014, we made one acquisition that complemented our existing completion and remedial services business segment. On September 17, 2014, we acquired all of the assets of Pioneer Fishing and Rental, Inc. for total cash consideration of $16.1 million. This acquisition is included in our completion and remedial services segment.\nSelected 2015 Acquisitions\nDuring 2015, we made three acquisitions that complemented our existing business segments, including GreyRock Pressure Pumping, LLC. On August 31, 2015, we acquired all of the assets of GreyRock Pressure Pumping, LLC, for total cash consideration of $10.2 million. This acquisition is included in our completion and remedial services segment.\nSegment Overview\nCompletion and Remedial Services\nIn 2016, our completion and remedial services segment represented 34% of our revenues. Revenues from our completion and remedial services segment are derived from a variety of services designed to stimulate oil and natural gas production or place cement slurry within the wellbores. Our completion and remedial services segment includes pumping services, rental and fishing tool operations, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, cased-hole wireline services, snubbing and underbalanced drilling.\nOur pumping services concentrate on providing single truck, lower-horsepower cementing and acidizing services, as well as various fracturing services in selected markets. Our total hydraulic horsepower capacity for our pumping services was approximately 444,000 horsepower at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nOur rental and fishing tool business operates 16 rental and fishing tool stores in selected markets as of December 31, 2016.\nOur snubbing services operate 36 units throughout our geographic footprint as of December 31, 2016.\nWe have operations in the wireline, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, water treatment and the underbalanced drilling services businesses. For a description of our wireline, coiled tubing services, nitrogen services, water treatment, and snubbing operations, please read Overview of Our Segments and Services - Completion and Remedial Services Segment\u201d included in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn this segment, we derive our revenues on a project-by-project basis in a competitive bidding process. Our bids are based on the amount and type of equipment and personnel required, with the materials consumed billed separately. During periods of decreased spending by oil and gas companies, we may be required to discount our rates to remain competitive, which would cause lower segment profits.\nThe following is an analysis of our completion and remedial services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Completion & Remedial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profits %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$137,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$164,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$193,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$203,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$698,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$112,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$69,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$67,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$58,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$307,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$39,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$36,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$49,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$59,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$184,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe gauge the performance of our completion and remedial services segment based on the segment's operating revenues and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nFluid Services\nIn 2016, our fluid services segment represented 35% of our revenues. Revenues in our fluid services segment are earned from the sale, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids used in the drilling, production and maintenance of oil and natural gas wells. Revenues also include water treatment, well site construction and maintenance services. The fluid services segment has a base level of business consisting of transporting and disposing of salt water produced as a by-product of the production of oil and natural gas. These services are necessary for our customers and have a stable demand but typically produce lower relative segment profits than other parts of our fluid services segment. Fluid services for completion and workover projects typically require fresh or brine water for making drilling mud, circulating fluids or fracturing fluids used during a job, and all of these fluids require storage tanks and hauling and disposal. Because we can provide a full complement of fluid sales, trucking, storage and disposal required on most drilling and workover projects, the add-on services associated with drilling and workover activity enable us to generate higher segment profits. The higher segment profits are due to the relatively small incremental labor costs associated with providing these services in addition to our base fluid services operations. Revenues from our well site construction services are derived primarily from preparing and maintaining access roads and well locations, installing small diameter gathering lines and pipelines, constructing foundations to support drilling rigs and providing maintenance services for oil and natural gas facilities. Revenue from water treatment services results from the treatment and reselling of produced water and flowback to customers for the purposes of reusing as fracturing water. We typically price fluid services by the job, by the hour or by the quantities sold, disposed of or hauled.\nThe following is an analysis of our fluid services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue Per\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment Profits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Fluid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fluid Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Fluid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fluid Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Service Trucks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Truck Hours\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Truck\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Service Truck\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profits %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>607,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>645,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>661,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,545,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>595,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>565,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>557,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,291,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>521,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,999,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe gauge activity levels and profitability in our fluid services segment based on trucking hours, revenue per fluid service truck, segment profits per fluid service truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nWell Servicing\nIn 2016, our well servicing segment represented 30% of our revenues. Revenue in our well servicing segment is derived from maintenance, workover, completion and plugging and abandonment services, as well as rig manufacturing operations. We provide maintenance-related services as part of the normal, periodic upkeep of producing oil and natural gas wells. Maintenance-related services represent a relatively consistent component of our business. Workover and completion services generate more revenue per hour than maintenance work due to the use of auxiliary equipment, but demand for workover and completion services fluctuates more with the overall activity level in the industry.\nWe typically charge our well servicing rig customers for services on an hourly basis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required, market conditions in the region in which the rig operates, the ancillary equipment provided on the rig and the necessary personnel. We measure the activity level of our well servicing rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a 55-hour work week per rig.\nWe acquired our rig manufacturing business in May 2010. We manufacture workover rigs for internal purposes as well as to sell to outside companies. Our rig manufacturing operation also performs large scale refurbishments and maintenance services to used workover rigs.\nThe following is an analysis of our well servicing segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Revenues from our contract drilling segment are derived primarily from the drilling of new wells.\nWithin this segment, we typically charge our drilling rig customers a daily rate or a rate based on footage at an established rate per number of feet drilled. Depending on the type of job, we may also charge by the project. We measure the activity level of our drilling rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a seven-day work week per rig.\nThe following is an analysis of our contract drilling segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rig\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract Drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>of Rigs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Days\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Day\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Day\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Profits %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$17,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$5,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$15,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$15,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-$600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$20,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$1,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$17,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$17,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe gauge activity levels and profitability in our drilling operations based on rig operating days, revenue per drilling day, profits per drilling day and segment profits as a percent of revenues.\nOperating Cost Overview\nOur operating costs are comprised primarily of labor costs, including workers' compensation and health insurance, repair and maintenance, fuel and insurance. A majority of our employees are paid on an hourly basis. We also employ personnel to supervise our activities, sell our services and perform maintenance on our fleet. These costs are not directly tied to our level of business activity. Repair and maintenance is performed by our crews, company maintenance personnel and outside service providers. Insurance is generally a fixed cost regardless of utilization and can vary depending on the number of rigs, trucks and other equipment in our fleet, as well as employee payroll, and our safety record. Compensation for administrative personnel in local operating yards and our corporate office is accounted for as general and administrative expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. We have identified below accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 5. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost, or at estimated fair value at acquisition date if acquired in a business combination. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We also review the capitalization of refurbishment of workover rigs as described in Note 5. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairments. We review our assets including tangible assets, intangible assets and goodwill, for impairment at a minimum annually, or whenever, in management's judgment, events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recovered over its remaining service life. Impairment is indicated when the sum of the estimated\nfuture cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, is less than the asset's carrying amount. When impairment is identified and fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded to income based on an estimate of future cash flows on a discounted basis.\nSelf-Insured Risk Accruals. We are self-insured up to retention limits with regard to workers' compensation, general liability claims, and medical and dental coverage of our employees. We generally maintain no physical property damage coverage on our rig fleet, with the exception of certain rigs, newly manufactured rigs and pumping services equipment. We have deductibles per occurrence for workers' compensation, auto & general liability claims, and medical and dental coverage of $5 million, $1 million, and $400,000, respectively. We maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self-insurance retentions by using third-party actuarial data and claims history.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenues when the services are performed, collection of the relevant receivables is probable, persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable. Rig manufacturing revenue is recognized by individual rig based on the completed contract method.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will be more likely more than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.Based on this evaluation, as of December 31, 2016, a valuation allowance of approximately $189.2 million has been recorded on the net deferred tax assets for all federal and state tax jurisdictions in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized. The valuation allowance is recognized as a result of the Company being in a cumulative three year pre-tax book loss position and absence of other objectively verifiable positive evidence including reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in federal and state tax jurisdictions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. We analyze our estimates based on experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ from such estimates. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates.\nDepreciation and Amortization. In order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment and our intangible assets with finite lives, we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of these items. Our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry.\nImpairment of Property and Equipment. We analyze the potential impairment of property and equipment annually as of December 31 or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair values of the assets have decreased below the carrying value. Our analysis for potential impairment of property and equipment requires us to estimate undiscounted future cash flows. Actual impairment charges are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows. The determination of future cash flows requires us to estimate rates and utilization in future periods and such estimates can change based on market conditions, technological advances in industry or changes in regulations governing the industry.\nInventories. For rental and fishing tools, inventories consisting mainly of grapples, controls, and drill bits are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the average cost method. Other inventories, consisting mainly of manufacturing raw materials, rig components, repair parts, drilling and completion materials and gravel, are held for use in the operations of Basic and are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of past collection activity and specific identification of overdue accounts. Factors that may affect this estimate include (1) changes in the financial positions of significant customers and (2) a decline in commodity prices that could affect the entire customer base.\nLitigation and Self-Insured Risk Reserves. We estimate our reserves related to litigation and self-insured risk based on the facts and circumstances specific to the litigation and self-insured risk claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of litigation and insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. As discussed in Self-Insured Risk Accruals\u201d above with respect to our critical accounting policies, we maintain accruals on our balance sheet to cover self-insured retentions. These accruals are based on a third-party analysis developed using historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon reported claims and actual claim settlements.\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed. We estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, which involves the use of various assumptions. These estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. The most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most judgment, involve the estimated fair value of property and equipment, intangible assets and the resulting amount of goodwill, if any.\nCash Flow Estimates. Our estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent available market and operating data for the applicable asset or reporting unit at the time the estimate is made. Our cash flow estimates are used for asset impairment analyses.\nStock-Based Compensation. We have historically compensated our directors, executives and employees through the awarding of stock options and restricted stock. We accounted for stock option and restricted stock awards in 2016, 2015 and 2014 using a grant date fair-value based method, resulting in compensation expense for stock-based awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. For performance-based restricted stock awards, compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on their grant date fair value. We utilize (i) the closing stock price on the date of the grant to determine the fair value of vesting restricted stock awards and (ii) a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards with a combination of market and service vesting criteria. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award. The expected volatility utilized in the model was estimated using our historical volatility and the historical volatilities of our"}
