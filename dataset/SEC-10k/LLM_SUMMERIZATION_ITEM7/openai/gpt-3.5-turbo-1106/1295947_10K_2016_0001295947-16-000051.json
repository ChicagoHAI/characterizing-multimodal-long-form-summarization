MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or described by the forward-looking statements. Future results could differ materially from the discussion that follows for many reasons, including the factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as those described in future reports filed with the SEC.\nGeneral\nWe are engaged in the marketing, sales and distribution of well-recognized, brand name OTC healthcare and household cleaning products to mass merchandisers, drug stores, supermarkets, and club, convenience, and dollar stores in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets. We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage.\nWe have grown our brand portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. We develop our existing brands by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and strong advertising support. Acquisitions of OTC brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We have acquired strong and well-recognized brands from consumer products, pharmaceutical and private equity companies. While many of these brands have long histories of brand development and investment, we believe that, at the time we acquired them, most were considered non-core\u201d by their previous owners. As a result, these acquired brands did not benefit from adequate management focus and marketing support during the period prior to their acquisition, which created opportunities for us to reinvigorate these brands and improve their performance post-acquisition. After adding a core brand to our portfolio, we seek to increase its sales, market share and distribution in both existing and new channels through our established retail distribution network. We pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and promotional support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations, and innovative development of brand extensions.\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of DenTek\nOn February 5, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of DenTek, a privately-held marketer and distributor of specialty oral care products. The closing was finalized pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, announced November 23, 2015, under which the Company agreed to acquire DenTek from its stockholders, including TSG Consumer Partners, for a purchase price of $228.3 million. The acquisition expands the Company's portfolio of brands, strengthens its existing oral care platform and increases its geographic reach in parts of Europe. The Company financed the transaction with a combination of available cash on hand, available cash from its ABL revolver, and financing of an additional unsecured bridge loan. The DenTek brands are primarily included in our North American and International OTC Healthcare segments.\nThe DenTek acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes our preliminary allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the February 5, 2016 acquisition date.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>February 5, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash acquired\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>9,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>14,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>3,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaids and other current assets\n</td> <td>6,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, plant and equipment, net\n</td> <td>3,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>76,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>206,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets acquired\n</td> <td>321,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>3,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued expenses\n</td> <td>16,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax liabilities - long term\n</td> <td>73,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>93,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total purchase price\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on this preliminary analysis, we allocated $179.8 million to non-amortizable intangible assets and $26.9 million to amortizable intangible assets. We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 18.5 years. The weighted average remaining life for amortizable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 was 18.4 years.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $76.5 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe pro forma effect of this acquisition on revenues and earnings was not material. However, revenues recorded during the period ended March 31, 2016 were $10.7 million since the date of the acquisition.\nAcquisition of Insight Pharmaceuticals\nOn September 3, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Insight , a marketer and distributor of feminine care and other OTC healthcare products, for $745.9 million in cash after receiving a return of approximately $7.2 million from escrow related to an arbitrator's ruling. The closing followed the FTC approval of the acquisition and was finalized pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement announced on April 25, 2014. Pursuant to the Insight purchase agreement, the Company acquired 27 OTC brands sold in North America (including related trademarks, contracts and inventory), which extended the Company's portfolio of OTC brands to include a leading feminine care platform in the United States and Canada anchored by Monistat, the leading North American brand in OTC yeast infection treatment. The acquisition also added brands to the Company's cough & cold, pain relief, ear care and dermatological platforms. In connection with the FTC's approval of the Insight acquisition, we sold one of the competing brands that we acquired from Insight on the same day as the Insight closing. Insight is primarily included in our North American OTC Healthcare segment.\nThe Insight acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we adjusted the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by increasing goodwill for certain immaterial items that came to our attention subsequent to the date of acquisition. Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we reduced goodwill, as we received $7.2 million as a result of a finalized arbitration ruling relating to a disputed working capital calculation as determined under GAAP, as of the date of the Insight acquisition, which is clearly and directly related to the purchase price. The following table summarizes our allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the September 3, 2014 acquisition date, after giving effect of the adjustments noted above.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>September 3, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash acquired\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>26,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>23,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax assets - current\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaids and other current assets\n</td> <td>1,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>2,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>96,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible assets\n</td> <td>724,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets acquired\n</td> <td>878,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>16,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued expenses\n</td> <td>8,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax liabilities - long term\n</td> <td>107,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>132,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total purchase price\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on this analysis, we allocated $599.6 million to indefinite-lived intangible assets and $124.8 million to amortizable intangible assets. We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 16.2 years. The weighted average remaining life for amortizable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 was 14.6 years.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $96.3 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired after of the adjustments described above. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe operating results of Insight have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning September 3, 2014. On September 3, 2014, we sold one of the brands we acquired from the Insight acquisition for $18.5 million, for which we had allocated $17.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.2 million to intangible assets, inventory and property, plant and equipment, respectively.\nThe following table provides our unaudited pro forma revenues, net income and net income per basic and diluted common share had the results of Insight's operations been included in our operations commencing on April 1, 2013, based upon available information related to Insight's operations. This pro forma information is not necessarily indicative either of the combined results of operations that actually would have been realized by us had the Insight acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the period for which the pro forma information is presented, or of future results.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Unaudited)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>783,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>767,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisition of the Hydralyte brand\nOn April 30, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Hydralyte brand in Australia and New Zealand from The Hydration Pharmaceuticals Trust of Victoria, Australia, which was funded through a combination of cash on hand and our existing senior secured credit facility.\nHydralyte is the leading OTC brand in oral rehydration in Australia and is marketed and sold through our Care Pharma subsidiary. Hydralyte is available in pharmacies in multiple forms and is indicated for oral rehydration following diarrhea, vomiting, fever, heat and other ailments. Hydralyte is included in our International OTC Healthcare segment.\nThe Hydralyte acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe pro forma effect of this acquisition on revenues and earnings was not material.\nAcquisition of Care Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd.\nOn July 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Care Pharma, which was funded through a combination of our existing senior secured credit facility and cash on hand.\nThe Care Pharma brands include the Fess line of cold/allergy and saline nasal health products, which is the leading saline spray for both adults and children in Australia. Other key brands include Painstop analgesic, Rectogesic for rectal discomfort, and the Fab line of nutritional supplements. Care Pharma also carries a line of brands for children including Little Allergies, Little Eyes, and Little Coughs. The brands acquired are complementary to our OTC Healthcare portfolio.\nThis acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.

We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 15.1 years. The weighted average remaining life for amortizable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 was 12.5 years.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $23.1 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. The full amount of goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe pro forma effect of this acquisition on revenues and earnings was not material.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While all significant accounting policies are important to our Consolidated Financial Statements, certain of these policies may be viewed as being critical. Such policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results from operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses or the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The most critical accounting policies are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the selling price is fixed or determinable; (iii) the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss; and (iv) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We have determined that these criteria are met and the transfer of risk of loss generally occurs when product is received by the customer, and, accordingly we recognize revenue at that time. Provisions are made for estimated discounts related to customer payment terms and estimated product returns at the time of sale based on our historical experience.\nAs is customary in the consumer products industry, we participate in the promotional programs of our customers to enhance the sale of our products. The cost of these promotional programs varies based on the actual number of units sold during a finite period of time. These promotional programs consist of direct-to-consumer incentives, such as coupons and temporary price reductions, as well as incentives to our customers, such as allowances for new distribution, including slotting fees, and cooperative advertising. Estimates of the costs of these promotional programs are based on (i) historical sales experience, (ii) the current promotional offering, (iii) forecasted data, (iv) current market conditions, and (v) communication with customer purchasing/marketing personnel. We recognize the cost of such sales incentives by recording an estimate of such cost as a reduction of revenue, at the\nlater of (a) the date the related revenue is recognized, or (b) the date when a particular sales incentive is offered. At the completion of the promotional program, these estimated amounts are adjusted to actual amounts. Our related promotional expense for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $56.4 million, $53.2 million, and $33.4 million, respectively. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we participated in over 26,000, 14,000, and 10,000 promotional campaigns, respectively. Of those campaigns, approximately 1,300, 1,900, and 1,700 payments were in excess of $5,000 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. For all three years, the average cost per campaign was less than $5,000. We believe that the estimation methodologies employed, combined with the nature of the promotional campaigns, make the likelihood remote that our obligation would be misstated by a material amount. However, for illustrative purposes, had we underestimated the promotional program rate by 10% for each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, our operating income would have been reduced by approximately $5.6 million, $5.3 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. Net income would have been adversely affected by approximately $3.6 million, $3.4 million, and $2.1 million, respectively.\nWe also periodically run coupon programs in Sunday newspaper inserts, on our product websites, or as on-package instant redeemable coupons. We utilize a national clearing house to process coupons redeemed by customers. At the time a coupon is distributed, a provision is made based upon historical redemption rates for that particular product, information provided as a result of the clearing house's experience with coupons of similar dollar value, the length of time the coupon is valid, and the seasonality of the coupon drop, among other factors. During 2016, we had 395 coupon events. The amount recorded against revenues and accrued for these events during the year was $5.6 million. Cash settlement of coupon redemptions during the year was $3.5 million.\nAllowances for Product Returns\nDue to the nature of the consumer products industry, we are required to estimate future product returns. Accordingly, we record an estimate of product returns concurrent with recording sales. Such estimates are made after analyzing (i) historical return rates, (ii) current economic trends, (iii) changes in customer demand, (iv) product acceptance, (v) seasonality of our product offerings, and (vi) the impact of changes in product formulation, packaging and advertising.\nWe construct our returns analysis by looking at the previous year's return history for each brand. Subsequently, each month, we estimate our current return rate based upon an average of the previous twelve months' return rate and review that calculated rate for reasonableness, giving consideration to the other factors described above. Our historical return rate has been relatively stable; for example, for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, returns represented 3.7%, 4.2% and 2.2%, respectively, of gross sales. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for sales returns was $10.7 million and $8.6 million, respectively.\nWhile we utilize the methodology described above to estimate product returns, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, causing our future financial results to be adversely affected. Among the factors that could cause a material change in the estimated return rate would be significant unexpected returns with respect to a product or products that comprise a significant portion of our revenues. Based on the methodology described above and our actual returns experience, management believes the likelihood of such an event remains remote. As noted, over the last three years our actual product return rate has stayed within a range of 2.2% to 4.2% of gross sales. A hypothetical increase of 0.1% in our estimated return rate as a percentage of gross sales would have decreased our reported sales and operating income for 2016 by approximately $0.9 million. Net income would have been reduced by approximately $0.6 million.\nLower of Cost or Market for Obsolete and Damaged Inventory\nWe value our inventory at the lower of cost or market value. Accordingly, we reduce our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.\nMany of our products are subject to expiration dating. As a general rule, our customers will not accept goods with expiration dating of less than 12 months from the date of delivery. To monitor this risk, management utilizes a detailed compilation of inventory with expiration dating between zero and 15 months and reserves for 100% of the cost of any item with expiration dating of 12 months or less. Inventory obsolescence costs charged to operations for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $2.6 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, or 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively, of net sales.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIn the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, which is based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable. In an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers' receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer's outstanding receivable balance.\nWe establish specific reserves for those accounts which file for bankruptcy, have no payment activity for 180 days, or have reported major negative changes to their financial condition. The allowance for bad debts amounted to 0.8% and 1.3% of accounts receivable at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Bad debt expense in each of the years 2016, 2015, and 2014 was less than approximately $0.3 million, representing less than 0.1% of net sales for each of 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nWhile management believes that it is diligent in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, an unexpected event, such as the bankruptcy filing of a major customer, could have an adverse effect on our financial results. A hypothetical increase of 0.1% in our bad debt expense as a percentage of net sales in 2016 would have resulted in a decrease of less than $0.1 million in reported operating income and reported net income.\nValuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nGoodwill and intangible assets amounted to $2,682.9 million and $2,425.4 million at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, goodwill and intangible assets were apportioned among similar product groups within our three operating segments as follows:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td>

in goodwill of $69.5 million for 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of DenTek, which increased goodwill by $76.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $7.2 million discussed below. On September 3, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Insight and recorded goodwill of $96.3 million, reflecting the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the preliminary estimate of fair value of net assets acquired, after giving effect to the following adjustments. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we increased goodwill by $0.3 million for certain immaterial items. During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we decreased goodwill by $7.2 million, as we received that amount from escrow pursuant to an arbitrator's ruling in December 31, 2015 related to a disputed working capital calculation, as determined under GAAP, associated with the Insight acquisition, which is clearly and directly related to the purchase price. The increase in the indefinite-lived intangible assets of $146.6 million for 2016 was due to the acquisition of DenTek, which increased indefinite-lived intangible assets by $179.8 million, and was offset by a reclassification of the Ecotrin brand to finite-lived of $32.9 million and $0.3 million due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in the finite-lived intangible assets of $41.4 million for 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of DenTek, which increased finite-lived brands by $26.9 million, the reclassification of the Ecotrin brand of $32.9 million from indefinite-lived, and was partially offset by amortization of $18.4 million.\nAt March 31, 2016, our highest valued brands were, Monistat, BC/Goody's, DenTek, Clear Eyes and Chloroseptic, comprising 52.2% of the intangible assets within the OTC Healthcare segments. The Comet, Chore Boy, and Spic and Span brands comprised all of the intangible assets value within the Household Cleaning segment.\nGoodwill and intangible assets comprise substantially all of our assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Intangible assets generally represent our trademarks, brand names and patents. When we acquire a brand, we are required to make judgments regarding the value assigned to the associated intangible assets, as well as their respective useful lives. Management considers many factors both prior to and after the acquisition of an intangible asset in determining the value, as well as the useful life, assigned to each intangible asset that we acquire or continue to own and promote.\nThe most significant factors are:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Brand History\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A brand that has been in existence for a long period of time (e.g., 25, 50 or 100 years) generally warrants a higher valuation and longer life (sometimes indefinite) than a brand that has been in existence for a very short period of time. A brand that has been in existence for an extended period of time generally has been the subject of considerable investment by its previous owner(s) to support product innovation and advertising and promotion.\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Market Position\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Consumer products that rank number one or two in their respective market generally have greater name recognition and are known as quality product offerings, which warrant a higher valuation and longer life than products that lag in the marketplace.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recent and Projected Sales Growth\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Recent sales results present a snapshot as to how the brand has performed in the most recent time periods and represent another factor in the determination of brand value. In addition, projected sales growth provides information about the strength and potential longevity of the brand. A brand that has both strong current and projected sales generally warrants a higher valuation and a longer life than a brand that has weak or declining sales. Similarly, consideration is given to the potential investment, in the form of advertising and promotion, required to reinvigorate a brand that has fallen from favor.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>History of and Potential for Product Extensions\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Consideration is given to the product innovation that has occurred during the brand's history and the potential for continued product innovation that will determine the brand's future. Brands that can be continually enhanced by new product offerings generally warrant a higher valuation and longer life than a brand that has always followed the leader\u201d.\nAfter consideration of the factors described above, as well as current economic conditions and changing consumer behavior, management prepares a determination of an intangible asset's value and useful life based on its analysis. Under accounting guidelines, goodwill is not amortized, but must be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying amount. In a similar manner, indefinite-lived assets are not amortized. They are also subject to an annual impairment test, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Additionally, at each reporting period an evaluation must be made to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and must also be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\nOn an annual basis, during the fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered, management performs a review of both the values and, if applicable, useful lives assigned to goodwill and intangible assets and tests for impairment.\nWe report goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in three reportable segments: North American OTC Healthcare, International OTC Healthcare and Household Cleaning. We identify our reporting units in accordance with the FASB ASC Subtopic 280. The carrying value and fair value for intangible assets and goodwill for a reporting unit are calculated based on key assumptions and valuation methodologies previously discussed. As a result, any material changes to these assumptions could require us to record additional impairment in the future.\nIn the past, we have experienced declines in revenues and profitability of certain brands in the North American OTC Healthcare and Household Cleaning segments. Sustained or significant future declines in revenue, profitability, other adverse changes in expected operating results, and/or unfavorable changes in other economic factors used to estimate fair values of certain brands could indicate that fair value no longer exceeds carrying value, in which case a non-cash impairment charge may be recorded in future periods.\nGoodwill\nAs of February 29, our annual impairment review date, and March 31, 2016, we had 15 reporting units with goodwill. As part of our annual test for impairment of goodwill, management estimates the discounted cash flows of each reporting unit to estimate their respective fair values. In performing this analysis, management considers current information and future events, such as competition, technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names, that could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions. In the event that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, management would then be required to allocate the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the unit was acquired in a business combination, thereby revaluing the carrying amount of goodwill.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAt each reporting period, management analyzes current events and circumstances to determine whether the indefinite life classification for a trademark or trade name continues to be valid. If circumstances warrant a change to a finite life, the carrying value of the intangible asset would then be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life.\nManagement tests the indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. Since quoted market prices are seldom available for trademarks and trade names such as ours, we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value. Accordingly, management's projections are utilized to assimilate all of the facts, circumstances and expectations related to the trademark or trade name and estimate the cash flows over its useful life. In a manner similar to goodwill, future events, such as competition, technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names, could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions. Once that analysis is completed, a discount rate is applied to the cash flows to estimate fair value. In connection with this analysis, management:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reviews period-to-period sales and profitability by brand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Analyzes industry trends and projects brand growth rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Prepares annual sales forecasts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Evaluates advertising effectiveness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Analyzes gross margins;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reviews contractual benefits or limitations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Monitors competitors' advertising spend and product innovation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Prepares projections to measure brand viability over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Considers the regulatory environment, as well as industry litigation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, management performs a review similar to indefinite-lived intangible assets to ascertain the impact of events and circumstances on the estimated useful lives and carrying values of our trademarks and trade names.\nIf the analysis warrants a change in the estimated useful life of the intangible asset, management will reduce the estimated useful life and amortize the carrying value prospectively over the shorter remaining useful life. Management's projections are utilized to assimilate all of the facts, circumstances and expectations related to the trademark or trade name and estimate the cash flows over its useful life. Future events, such as competition, technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names, could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions. In the event that the long-term projections indicate that the carrying value is in excess of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible assets, management is required to record an impairment charge. Once that analysis is completed, a discount rate is applied to the cash flows to estimate fair value. The impairment charge is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over fair value, as calculated using the excess earnings method.\nImpairment Analysis\nDuring the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, we perform our annual impairment analysis. We utilized the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as part of the goodwill impairment test and the excess earnings method to estimate the fair value of our individual indefinite-lived intangible assets. The discount rate utilized in the analyses, as well as future cash flows, may be influenced by such factors as changes in interest rates and rates of inflation. Additionally, should the related fair values of goodwill and intangible assets be adversely affected as a result of declining sales or margins caused by competition, changing consumer preferences, technological advances or reductions in advertising and promotional expenses, we may be required to record impairment charges in the future. In addition, we considered our market capitalization at February 29, 2016, as compared to the aggregate fair values of our reporting units, to assess the reasonableness of our estimates pursuant to the discounted cash flow methodology. As a result of our analysis, we determined that the fair values exceeded the carrying values and as such, no impairment charge was recorded in 2016.\nBased on our analysis, the aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value by 76.4%, with no reporting unit's fair value exceeding the carrying value by less than 10%. The aggregate fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded the carrying value by 55.8%. Three of the individual indefinite-lived trade names exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%. The fair value of Beano, New Skin and Debrox, exceed their carrying values of $78.4 million, $37.2 million and $76.3 million, by 9.0%, 8.2% and 5.1%, respectively.\nGiven the competitive landscape, including private label, Beano has experienced declines in revenues in recent periods. However, we continue to believe that the fair value exceeds the carrying value of Beano. The significant assumptions supporting the fair value of Beano include a discount rate of 9.5%, and returning to revenue growth, coupled with advertising and promotion investments that are in line with historical performance. A decrease in the annual cash flow of approximately 21.6% compared to the projected cash flow utilized in our analysis, or an increase in the discount rate of approximately 82 basis points could result in the carrying value of our trade name exceeding its fair value, which would result in an impairment charge.\nThe significant assumptions supporting the fair value of New Skin and Debrox include a discount rate of 9.5%, coupled with modest revenue growth, and advertising and promotion investments that are in line with historical performance. Revenue declines in each of the brands or changes in assumptions utilized in our quantitative indefinite lived asset impairment analysis may result in the fair value no longer exceeding their respective carrying values. For example, a decrease in the annual cash flow of approximately 19.6% and 12.6% for New Skin and Debrox, respectively, compared to the projected cash flow utilized in our analysis, or an increase in the discount rate of approximately 73 and 45 basis points, respectively, could result in the carrying value of our trade name exceeding its fair value, which would result in an impairment charge. We will continue to review our results against forecasts and assess our assumptions to ensure they continue to be appropriate.\nBased on recent declines in the business and a strategic review of our brands during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2016 and our annual impairment review, we have reassessed the useful life of the Ecotrin brand as of February 29, 2016 and determined it to be 20 years. As such, we have reclassified $32.9 million from an indefinite-lived to a finite lived intangible asset. At the time of this change in useful life, the fair value exceeded its carrying value.\nAlthough we experienced revenue declines in Pediacare and in certain other brands in the past, we continue to believe that the fair value of our brands exceed their carrying values. However, sustained or significant future declines in revenue, profitability, lost distribution, other adverse changes in expected operating results, and / or unfavorable changes in economic factors used to estimate fair value of certain brands could indicate that the fair value no longer exceeds the carrying in which case a non-cash impairment charge may be recorded in future periods.\nAdditionally, certain of our North American OTC Healthcare and Household Cleaning brands, have experienced recent declines in revenues and profitability. While the fair value of these reporting units exceeds the carrying value by more than 10%, if we experience future declines in revenue or performance not in line with our expectations, the carrying value may no longer be recoverable, in which case a non-cash impairment charge may be recorded in future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Compensation and Equity topic of the FASB ASC 718 requires us to measure the cost of services to be rendered based on the grant-date fair value of the equity award. Compensation expense is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, generally referred to as the requisite service period. Information utilized in the determination of fair value includes the following:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Type of instrument (i.e., restricted shares, stock options, warrants or performance shares);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Strike price of the instrument;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Market price of our common stock on the date of grant;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Duration of the instrument; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Volatility of our common stock in the public market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, management must estimate the expected attrition rate of the recipients to enable it to estimate the amount of non-cash compensation expense to be recorded in our financial statements. While management prepares various analyses to estimate the respective variables, a change in assumptions or market conditions, as well as changes in the anticipated attrition rates, could have a significant impact on the future amounts recorded as non-cash compensation expense. We recorded net non-cash compensation expense of $10.0 million, $6.9 million and $5.1 million during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Assuming no changes in assumptions and no new awards authorized by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, we expect to record non-cash compensation expense of approximately $5.9 million during 2017.\nLoss Contingencies\nLoss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable. Contingent losses are often resolved over longer periods of time and involve many factors, including:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sufficiency of the evidence in support of our position;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Anticipated costs to support our position; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Likelihood of a positive outcome.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments in this update clarify the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing in FASB ASC 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09 described below. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this update involve several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments in this update clarify the implementation guidance on principals versus agent considerations in FASB ASC 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09 described below. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The amendments in this update include a new FASB ASC Topic 842, which supersedes Topic 840. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of interim or annual reporting periods. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. For public business entities, the amendments in this update include the elimination of the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, the requirement to use the exit price notion when measuring fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, the requirement to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments, the requirement for separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or accompanying notes to the financial statements, and the amendments clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is not permitted, except that early application by public business entities to financial statements of fiscal years or interim\nperiods that have not yet been issued or, by all other entities, that have not yet been made available for issuance are permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption for the following amendment: An entity should present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk if the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. An entity should apply the amendments to this update by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of interim or annual reporting periods. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments in this update eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The amendments in this update more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards, under which an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As permitted by the guidance, we have early adopted these provisions, as of the beginning of our first quarter of 2016. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, stating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. As a result, we reclassified $27.4 million of deferred financing costs as of March 31, 2015 from other long-term assets, and such costs are now presented as a direct deduction from the long-term debt liability.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. Update 2015-02 amended the process that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items. The amendments in this update eliminate the concept of extraordinary items in Subtopic 225-20, which required entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary. However, the amendments retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This amendment states that in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). The amendments in this update are effective for the annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period, which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the new guidance does not allow for a performance target that affects vesting to be reflected in estimating the fair value of the award at the grant date. The amendments to this update are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this update either prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. We currently do not have any outstanding share-based payments with a performance target. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Topic 606, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC 605. The new guidance primarily states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 from annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization's operations and financial results. Examples include a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment. In addition, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. The amendments in this update must be applied prospectively to all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\n2016 compared to 2015\nTotal Segment Revenues\nThe following table

$806.2 million, an increase of $91.6 million, or 12.8%, versus 2015. This increase was primarily related to an increase in the North American OTC Healthcare segment, largely due to the acquisitions of Insight and DenTek. The Insight and DenTek brands accounted for $74.1 million and $9.3 million, respectively, of revenues in the North American OTC Healthcare segment that were not included in the comparable period in the prior year.\nNorth American OTC Healthcare Segment\nRevenues for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased $91.0 million, or 16.0%, during 2016 versus 2015. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Insight, which contributed $74.1 million of revenues not included in the comparable period in the prior year, and included increases of $55.3 million, $11.3 million, $2.5 million, $2.4 million and $1.7 million to the women's health, dermatologicals, eye & ear care, cough & cold, and analgesics product groups, respectively. The increase was also due to the acquisition of DenTek, which contributed $9.3 million to the segment overall.\nIn addition to the revenue increases contributed by Insight and DenTek, there was an increase of $7.6 million in revenue included in the comparable period in prior year, primarily consisting of increases in the eye & ear care, dermatologicals, women's health and analgesics product groups, which was partially offset by decreases in the gastrointestinal and cough & cold product groups.\nThe decrease in the cough & cold product group and the gastrointestinal product group was partially due to Pediacare and Beano, respectively, which continue to experience declines in revenues and market share due to increasing competition. Although we experienced declines in revenues in Pediacare and Beano, we continue to believe that the carrying value of each of these brands is recoverable. However, if we experience future declines in revenue or performance not in line with our expectations, the carrying value may no longer be recoverable, in which case a non-cash impairment charge may be recorded in future periods.\nIn the past, in our women's health and analgesics product groups, a third-party manufacturer had failed to keep up with demand, leading to product being temporarily out of stock. However, in the third quarter of calendar 2015, those out of stock issues were resolved as a result of increased manufacturing. If these types of supply issues resurface in these or in other product groups that are not resolved timely, we may not have enough product to meet demand, which could adversely impact our business, result in a significant reduction of net sales and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInternational OTC Healthcare Segment\nRevenues for the International OTC Healthcare segment decreased $0.1 million, or 0.1%, during 2016 versus 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the cough & cold product group and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates during 2016 versus 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the gastrointestinal product group, which was largely attributable to the acquisition of Hydralyte.\nHousehold Cleaning Segment\nRevenues for the Household Cleaning segment increased by $0.7 million, or 0.8%, during 2016 versus 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased sales in certain distribution channels.\nCost of Sales\nThe following table represents our cost of sales and cost of sales as a percentage of total segment revenues, by segment for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Sales\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American OTC Healthcare\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International OTC Healthcare\n</td> <td>21,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,144\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Household Cleaning\n</td> <td>67,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,457\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales increased $30.6 million, or 9.9%, during 2016 versus 2015. This increase was largely due to increased sales volume associated with the acquisitions of DenTek, Insight, and Hydralyte. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of sales decreased to 42.1% in 2016 from 43.2% in 2015. This decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was the result of decreases in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in the International and Household Cleaning segments.\nNorth American OTC Healthcare Segment\nCost of sales for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased $33.2 million, or 15.3%, during 2016 versus 2015. This increase was due to higher overall sales volume primarily from the acquisitions of DenTek and Insight and to higher manufacturing costs for certain of our products. As a percentage of North American OTC Healthcare revenues, cost of sales in the North American OTC Healthcare segment remained relatively consistent in 2016 versus 2015.\nInternational OTC Healthcare Segment\nCost of sales for the International OTC Healthcare segment decreased $1.1 million, or 5.0%, during 2016 versus 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in cost of sales in the eye & ear care, gastrointestinal and cough & cold product groups, driven by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations year over year. As a percentage of the International OTC Healthcare revenues, cost of sales in the International OTC Healthcare segment decreased to 37.6% in 2016 from 39.5% during 2015. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the product groups discussed above.\nHousehold Cleaning Segment\nCost of sales for the Household Cleaning segment decreased $1.5 million, or 2.1%, during 2016 versus 2015. As a percentage of Household Cleaning revenues, cost of sales decreased to 74.3% during 2016 from 76.5% during 2015. This decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to a favorable product mix.\nGross Profit\nThe following table represents our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of total segment revenues, by segment for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American OTC Healthcare\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International OTC Healthcare\n</td> <td>36,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Household Cleaning\n</td> <td>23,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>467,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>406,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit for 2016 increased $61.0 million, or 15.0%, versus 2015. As a percentage of total revenues, gross profit increased to 57.9% in 2016 from 56.8% in 2015. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of higher gross margins associated with the acquired DenTek and Insight brands.\nNorth American OTC Healthcare Segment\nGross profit for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased $57.7 million, or 16.5%, during 2016 versus 2015. This increase was due to higher overall sales volume, primarily from the acquisitions of DenTek and Insight, slightly offset by higher manufacturing costs for certain of our products.

As a percentage of International OTC Healthcare revenues, gross profit increased to 62.4% during 2016 from 60.5% during 2015. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in gross margin in the eye & ear care and gastrointestinal product groups.\nHousehold Cleaning Segment\nGross profit for the Household Cleaning segment increased $2.2 million, or 10.3%, during 2016 versus 2015. As a percentage of Household Cleaning revenue, gross profit increased to 25.7% during 2016 from 23.5% during 2015.

It is defined as gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses. Contribution margin increased $49.8 million, or 16.3%, during 2016 versus 2015. The contribution margin increase was primarily related to the increase in gross profit in the North American OTC Healthcare segment.\nNorth American OTC Healthcare Segment\nContribution margin for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased $47.2 million, or 17.9%, during 2016 versus 2015. The contribution margin increase was primarily the result of higher sales volumes and gross profit attributable to the DenTek and Insight acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in advertising and promotional expenses. As a percentage of North American OTC Healthcare revenues, contribution margin for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased to 47.2% during 2016 versus 46.4% during 2015.\nInternational OTC Healthcare Segment\nContribution margin for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $0.9 million, or 3.6%, during 2016 versus 2015. As a percentage of International OTC Healthcare revenues, contribution margin from the International OTC Healthcare segment increased to 43.2% during 2016 from 41.6% during 2015. This contribution margin increase was primarily related to the increase in gross profit in the International OTC Healthcare segment discussed above.\nHousehold Cleaning Segment\nContribution margin for the Household Cleaning segment increased $1.7 million, or 8.9%, during 2016 versus 2015. As a percentage of Household Cleaning revenues, contribution margin from the Household Cleaning segment increased to 23.2% during 2016 from 21.5% during 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a favorable product mix in certain distribution channels.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $72.4 million for 2016 versus $81.3 million for 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition costs of $13.2 million associated with the acquisition and integration of Insight in the prior year. This decrease was also attributable to a lease termination charge of $0.8 million related to the remaining lease payments from the Insight office incurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in 2016 in compensation, stock based compensation and information technology costs of $3.5 million, $3.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $23.7 million for 2016 versus $17.7 million for 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization during 2016 related to the intangible assets acquired as a result of the DenTek and Insight acquisitions. Additionally, the increase in depreciation and amortization is partially due to higher intangible asset amortization during 2016 related to Pediacare, as this trade name was reclassified to a finite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment analysis conducted during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015.\nInterest Expense\nNet interest expense was $85.2 million during 2016 versus $81.2 million during 2015. The increase in net interest expense was primarily the result of a higher level of indebtedness, primarily related to the acquisitions of DenTek and Insight. The average indebtedness outstanding increased from $1.4 billion during 2015 to $1.5 billion during 2016. The increase in average indebtedness outstanding is the result of additional borrowings under our term loan facility and revolving credit facility to fund our acquisition of Insight and the 2016 Senior Notes to fund the acquisition of DenTek. The average cost of borrowing decreased to 5.4% during 2016, from 5.9% during 2015. The decrease in the average costs of borrowing is partially attributable to the issuance of the 2016 Senior Notes and the redemption of the 2012 Senior Notes during 2016; as the interest rate for the 2016 Senior Notes is 6.375% versus the interest rate of 8.125% for the 2012 Senior Notes, including the accelerated portion of debt origination costs incurred in 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes during 2016 was $57.3 million versus $49.2 million in 2015. The effective tax rate on income before income taxes was 36.4% during 2016 versus 38.6% during 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2016 versus 2015 was primarily due to the impact of certain non-deductible items related to acquisitions in the prior year and to the favorable tax deductions related to stock options, equity awards and certain foreign tax credits realized in the current year period.\nResults of Operations\n2015 compared to 2014\nTotal Segment Revenues\nThe

This increase was primarily related to an increase in the North American OTC Healthcare segment due to the acquisition of Insight and an increase in the International OTC Healthcare segment due to the acquisition of the Hydralyte brand. The increase was partially offset by a decline in some of the product groups within the North American OTC Healthcare segment.\nNorth American OTC Healthcare Segment\nRevenues for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased $84.0 million, or 17.4%, during 2015 versus 2014. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Insight, which contributed $96.9 million to the segment overall, and included increases of $69.9 million, $15.4 million, and $5.0 million to the women's health, dermatologicals, and cough & cold product groups, respectively. These increases were partially offset by declines of $7.1 million and $5.1 million in the dermatologicals and gastrointestinal product groups (exclusive of Insight), respectively, due to lower revenues for certain of our products in those product groups.\nAdditionally, in our women's health product group, a third-party manufacturer had failed to keep up with demand, leading to product being temporarily out of stock. However, in the third quarter of calendar 2015, those out of stock issues were resolved as a result of increased manufacturing If these types of supply issues resurface in this or in other product groups and are not\nresolved timely, we may not have enough product to meet demand, which could adversely impact our business, result in a significant reduction of net sales and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInternational OTC Healthcare segment\nRevenues for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $31.1 million, or 116.2%, during 2015 versus 2014. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the Hydralyte brand, which contributed $17.9 million to the gastrointestinal product group. The increase was also attributable to increases of $6.0 million and $4.7 million in the eye & ear care and cough & cold product groups (exclusive of Hydralyte), respectively.\nHousehold Cleaning Segment\nRevenues for the Household Cleaning segment increased $2.2 million, or 2.5%, during 2015 versus 2014.

This increase was largely due to increased sales volume associated with the acquisitions of Insight, Hydralyte and Care Pharma within the North American and International OTC Healthcare segments. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of sales decreased to 43.2% in 2015 from 43.8% in 2014 primarily due to the favorable impact from lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in the International OTC Healthcare segment.\nNorth American OTC Healthcare Segment\nCost of sales for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased $32.0 million, or 17.3%, during 2015 versus 2014. This increase was due to higher overall sales volume from the acquisition of Insight, partially offset by lower manufacturing product costs for certain of our products.

This increase was due to higher sales volumes in the products acquired from the acquisitions of Hydralyte and Care Pharma. As a percentage of International OTC Healthcare revenues, cost of sales in the International OTC Healthcare segment decreased to 39.5% in 2015 from 47.3% in 2014. This decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower costs associated with the Hydralyte and Care Pharma acquisitions.\nHousehold Cleaning Segment\nCost of sales for the Household Cleaning segment increased $4.4 million, or 6.9%, during 2015 versus 2014. As a percentage of Household Cleaning revenues, cost of sales increased to 76.5% during 2015 from 73.4% during 2014. This increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily related to an unfavorable product mix resulting from higher sales volumes at lower prices in certain distribution channels.\nGross Profit\nThe following table represents our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of total segment revenues, by segment for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American OTC Healthcare\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International OTC Healthcare\n</td> <td>34,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Household Cleaning\n</td> <td>21,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>406,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit for 2015 increased $70.7 million, or 21.1%, versus 2014. As a percentage of total revenues, gross profit increased to 56.8% in 2015 from 56.2% in 2014. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of higher gross margins recognized in the International OTC Healthcare segment due to the acquisition of Hydralyte.\nNorth American OTC Healthcare Segment\nGross profit for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased $52.0 million, or 17.5%, during 2015 versus 2014. This increase was due to higher overall sales volume, primarily from the acquisition of Insight, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs for certain of our products. As a percentage of North American OTC Healthcare revenues, gross profit remained consistent in 2015 versus 2014.\nInternational OTC Healthcare Segment\nGross profit for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $20.9 million, or 148.3%, during 2015 versus 2014. This increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Hydralyte and Care Pharma. As a percentage of International OTC Healthcare revenues, gross profit increased to 60.5% during 2015 from 52.7% during 2014. The increase was due to the higher gross profit percentage from the acquisition of Hydralyte and Care Pharma.\nHousehold Cleaning Segment\nGross profit for the Household Cleaning segment decreased $2.2 million, or 9.6%, during 2015 versus 2014. As a percentage of Household Cleaning revenue, gross profit decreased to 23.5% during 2015 from 26.6% during 2014. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily related to higher sales through certain distribution channels that have lower gross margins.\nContribution Margin\nThe following table represents our contribution margin and contribution margin as a percentage of total segment revenues, by segment for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contribution Margin\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North American OTC Healthcare\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International OTC Healthcare\n</td> <td>24,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Household Cleaning\n</td> <td>19,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,450\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContribution margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a primary measure for evaluating segment performance. It is defined as gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses. Contribution margin increased $56.0 million, or 22.3%, during 2015 versus 2014. The contribution margin increase was primarily the result of the increased gross profit in the North American and International OTC Healthcare segments discussed above.\nNorth American OTC Healthcare Segment\nContribution margin for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased $42.2 million, or 19.1%, during 2015 versus 2014. The contribution margin increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit discussed above, partially offset by higher advertising and promotional expenses. As a percentage of North American OTC Healthcare revenues, contribution margin for the North American OTC Healthcare segment increased to 46.4% during 2015 versus 45.8% during 2014. Advertising and promotional spending increased during 2015 versus 2014 due primarily to the Insight acquisition, partially offset by reduced spending on Pediacare, Beano, and Gaviscon.\nInternational OTC Healthcare Segment\nContribution margin for the International OTC Healthcare segment increased $15.2 million, or 172.7%, during 2015 versus 2014. The contribution margin increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit discussed above, partially offset by higher advertising and promotional expenses. As a percentage of International OTC Healthcare revenues, contribution margin from the International OTC Healthcare segment increased to 41.6% during 2015 from 33.0% during 2014. This increase was primarily related to the increased gross profit from the Hydralyte and Care Pharma acquisitions discussed above.\nHousehold Cleaning Segment\nContribution margin for the Household Cleaning segment decreased $1.5 million, or 7.0%, during 2015 versus 2014. As a percentage of Household Cleaning revenues, contribution margin from the Household Cleaning segment decreased to 21.5% during 2015 from 23.6% during 2014. The contribution margin decrease was the result of gross profit changes discussed above, partially offset by lower advertising and promotional spending.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $81.3 million for 2015 versus $48.5 million for 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase in compensation costs of $13.8 million due to increased headcount associated with the Insight and Hydralyte acquisitions, an increase of $12.8 million in acquisition costs related to the purchases of Insight and Hydralyte, and an increase in legal and other professional costs of $1.7 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $17.7 million for 2015 versus $13.5 million for 2014. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to slightly higher intangible asset amortization in the current period, primarily related to intangible assets associated with the Insight acquisition.\nInterest Expense\nNet interest expense was $81.2 million during 2015 versus $68.6 million during 2014. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of a higher level of indebtedness, primarily related to the acquisition of Insight. The average indebtedness outstanding increased from $976.7 million during 2014 to $1.4 billion during 2015. The increase in average indebtedness outstanding was the result of additional borrowings under our 2012 Term B-2 Loans and 2012 ABL Revolver to fund our acquisitions of the Hydralyte brand and Insight. The average cost of borrowing decreased to 5.9% for 2015, from 7.0% for 2014, which is attributed to the refinancing of debt in September 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes during 2015 was $49.2 million versus $29.1 million in 2014. The effective tax rate on pretax income was 38.6% during 2015 versus 28.6% during 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 was primarily due to the impact of certain non-deductible items related to acquisitions of $2.9 million, and a higher gain for tax purposes associated with the sale of the right to use of the Comet brand in certain Eastern European countries in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and a one-time benefit of $9.1 million due primarily to lower state income taxes enacted in the prior year period. This benefit was primarily related to a law change in the state where we have our major distribution center to tax earnings attributed to in-state revenues only.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur primary source of cash comes from our cash flow from operations. In the past, we have supplemented this source of cash with various debt facilities, primarily in connection with acquisitions. We have financed, and expect to continue to finance our operations over the next twelve months, with a combination of borrowings and funds generated from operations. Our principal uses of cash are for operating expenses, debt service, acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures. Based on our current levels of operations and anticipated growth, excluding acquisitions, we believe that our cash generated from operations, and our existing credit facilities, will be adequate to finance our working capital and capital expenditures through the next twelve months, although no assurance can be given in this regard.\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(222,971\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(805,258\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,976\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>54,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>643,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,153\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to 2015\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $174.4 million for 2016 compared to $156.3 million for 2015. The $18.1 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in non-cash charges of $31.6 million and an increase in net income of $21.6 million, partially offset by an increase in working capital of $35.1 million.\nWorking capital is defined as current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) minus current liabilities. Working capital increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to increases in the year-over-year change in inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $18.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively, and a decrease in the year-over-year change in accrued liabilities of $10.7 million. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the year-over-year change in accounts payable of $6.3 million. The year-over-year increase of $18.4 million in inventory is primarily the result of an inventory build of $3.0 million in the current year period primarily related to certain brands in anticipation of short-term requirements and a $15.4 million inventory usage in the prior year period primarily associated with certain brands selling through and holding less stock.\nNon-cash charges increased $31.6 million year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in deferred income taxes of $17.2 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $18.0 million in the current period, and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $5.9 million. The increase in non-cash charges was partially offset by a premium payment on the 2012 Senior Notes of $10.2 million in 2016 and a decrease in long term income taxes payable of $2.6 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $223.0 million for 2016 compared to $805.3 million for 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the cash for the acquisition of Insight in September 2014 of $749.7 million, the acquisition of the Hydralyte brand in April 2014 of $78.0 million, and the proceeds received from the escrow following the arbitrator's ruling related to the working capital dispute of the Insight acquisition of $7.2 million in the current year. This change was partially offset by the cash used for the acquisition of DenTek in February 2016 of $227.0 million. Additionally, the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015, was partially attributable to $18.5 million of proceeds from the sale of one brand we acquired from the Insight acquisition, and $10.0 million received as proceeds from the sale of certain rights to sell our Comet brand in certain Eastern European countries to a third-party licensee, both in the prior year.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $54.0 million for 2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $643.3 million for 2015. This change was primarily due to net borrowings under our credit facilities of $656.1 million in the prior year primarily to acquire Insight, repayment in the current year of $250.0 million in 2016 for the 2012 Senior Notes, and net repayments under our existing credit facilities of $41.1 million in the current year. This change was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance in 2016 of the 2016 Senior Notes of $350.0 million.\n2015 compared to 2014\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $156.3 million for 2015 compared to $111.6 million for 2014. The $44.7 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in working capital of $25.3 million, an increase in non-cash charges of $13.8 million, and an increase in net income of $5.6 million.\nWorking capital is defined as current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) minus current liabilities. The working capital decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to decreases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $18.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, and an increase in accrued liabilities of $21.4 million. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $13.0 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $8.1 million.\nNon-cash charges increased $13.8 million primarily due to a premium payment on the 2010 Senior Notes tendered in fiscal 2014 of $15.5 million, and increases in deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and long term income taxes payable of $9.9 million, $4.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The increase in non-cash charges was partially offset by a $18.3 million loss on the extinguishment of debt incurred in fiscal 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $805.3 million for 2015 compared to $58.0 million for 2014. This was primarily due to the use of cash for the acquisition of Insight in September 2014 of $749.7 million and for the acquisition of the Hydralyte brand in April 2014 of $78.0 million, compared to $55.2 million for the acquisition of Care in July 2014. This was slightly offset by proceeds from the sale of one of the brands we acquired from the Insight acquisition of $18.5 million and $10.0 million received as proceeds from the sale of certain rights to use our Comet brand in certain Eastern European countries to a third-party licensee.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $643.3 million for 2015 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $41.2 million for 2014. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the additional borrowings of $590.0 million under our term loan facility and $66.1 million under our revolving credit facility in 2015, while 2014 resulted in net repayment under the 2012 ABL Revolver of $33.0 million. We utilized $65.0 million of borrowings under the ABL Revolver for the acquisition of the Hydralyte brand and repaid $58.5 million during 2015. Due to the net borrowing under the 2012 ABL Revolver and 2012 Term Loan, our outstanding indebtedness increased to $1,593.6 million at March 31, 2015 from $937.5 million at March 31, 2014.\nCapital Resources\n2012 Senior Notes:\nOn January 31, 2012, Prestige Brands, Inc. (the \"Borrower\") issued $250.0 million of the 2012 Senior Notes at par value, with an interest rate of 8.125% and a maturity date of February 1, 2020. The Borrower could earlier redeem some or all of the 2012 Senior Notes at redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 2012 Senior Notes. The 2012 Senior Notes were guaranteed by Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. and certain of its domestic 100% owned subsidiaries, other than the Borrower. Each of these guarantees was joint and several. There were no significant restrictions on the ability of any of the guarantors to obtain funds from their subsidiaries or to make payments to the Borrower or the Company. In connection with the 2012 Senior Notes offering, we incurred $12.6 million of costs, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and were being amortized over the term of the 2012 Senior Notes. As of March 31, 2016, there were no outstanding balances, as the Company used the net proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes issuance (discussed below) to repay all of the balances associated with the 2012 Senior Notes.\n2012 Term Loan and 2012 ABL Revolver:\nOn January 31, 2012, the Borrower also entered into a new senior secured credit facility, which consists of (i) the 2012 Term Loan, a $660.0 million term loan facility with a 7-year maturity and (ii) the 2012 ABL Revolver, a $50.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility with a 5-year maturity. In subsequent years, we have utilized portions of our accordion feature to increase the amount of our borrowing capacity under the 2012 ABL Revolver by $85.0 million to $135.0 million and reduced our borrowing rate on the 2012 ABL Revolver by 0.25%. The 2012 Term Loan was issued with an original issue discount of 1.5% of the principal amount thereof, resulting in net proceeds to the Borrower of $650.1 million. In connection with these loan facilities, we incurred $20.6 million of costs, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the terms of the facilities. The 2012 Term Loan is unconditionally guaranteed by Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. and certain of its domestic 100% owned subsidiaries, other than the Borrower. Each of these guarantees is joint and several. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of any of the guarantors to obtain funds from their subsidiaries or to make payments to the Borrower or the Company.\nOn February 21, 2013, the Borrower entered into Term Loan Amendment No. 1. Term Loan Amendment No. 1 provided for the refinancing of all of the Borrower's existing Term B Loans with new Term B-1 Loans. The interest rate on the Term B-1 Loans under the Term Loan Amendment No. 1 was based, at the Borrower's option, on a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.75% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, or an alternate base rate, with a floor of 2.00%, plus a margin. The new Term B-1 Loans would have matured on the same date as the Term B Loans' original maturity date. In addition, Term Loan Amendment No. 1 provided the Borrower with certain additional capacity to prepay subordinated debt, the 2012 Senior Notes and certain other unsecured indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and 2012 ABL Revolver. In connection with Term Loan Amendment No. 1, during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2013, we recognized a $1.4 million loss on the extinguishment of debt.\nOn September 3, 2014, the Borrower entered into Term Loan Amendment No. 2. Term Loan Amendment No. 2 provides for (i) the creation of a new class of Term B-2 Loans under the 2012 Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $720.0 million, (ii) increased flexibility under the credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and 2012 ABL Revolver, including additional investment, restricted payment and debt incurrence flexibility and financial maintenance covenant relief, and (iii) an interest rate on (x) the Term B-1 Loans that was based, at the Borrower's option, on a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 3.125% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, or an alternate base rate, with a floor of 2.00%, plus a margin, and (y) the Term B-2 Loans that was based, at the Borrower's option, on a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 3.50% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, or an alternate base rate, with a floor of 2.00%, plus a margin (with a margin step-down to 3.25% per annum, based upon achievement of a specified secured net leverage ratio).\nAlso, on September 3, 2014, the Borrower entered into ABL Amendment No. 3. ABL Amendment No. 3 provides for (i) a $40.0 million increase in revolving commitments under the 2012 ABL Revolver and (ii) increased flexibility under the credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and 2012 ABL Revolver, including additional investment, restricted payment and debt incurrence flexibility. Borrowings under the 2012 ABL Revolver, as amended, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin, plus, at the Borrower's option, either (i) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., and (c) the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month, adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs. The initial applicable margin for borrowings under the 2012 ABL Revolver is 1.75% with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 0.75% with respect to base-rate borrowings. The applicable margin for borrowings under the 2012 ABL Revolver may be increased to 2.00% or 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.00% or 1.25% for base-rate borrowings, depending on average excess availability under the 2012 ABL Revolver during the prior fiscal quarter. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the 2012 ABL Revolver, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the 2012 ABL Revolver in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The initial commitment fee rate is 0.50% per annum. The commitment fee rate will be\nreduced to 0.375% per annum at any time when the average daily unused commitments for the prior quarter is less than a percentage of total commitments by an amount set forth in the credit agreement covering the 2012 ABL Revolver. We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the 2012 ABL Revolver at any time without a premium or penalty.\nOn May 8, 2015, the Borrower entered into Amendment No. 3 (the \"Term Loan Amendment No. 3\") to the 2012 Term Loan. Term Loan Amendment No. 3 provides for (i) the creation of a new class of Term B-3 Loans under the 2012 Term Loan (the \"Term B-3 Loans\") in an aggregate principal amount of $852.5 million, which combined the outstanding balances of the Term B-1 Loans of $207.5 million and the Term B-2 Loans of $645.0 million, (ii) increased flexibility under the credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan, including additional investment, restricted payment, and debt incurrence flexibility and financial maintenance covenant relief, and (iii) an interest rate on the Term B-3 Loans that is based, at the Borrower's option, on a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.75% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, or an alternate base rate, with a floor of 1.75%, plus a margin. The maturity date of the Term B-3 Loans remains the same as the Term B-2 Loans' original maturity date of September 3, 2021.\nThe 2012 Term Loan, as amended, bears interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the Borrower's option, either (i) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., (c) the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month, adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00% and (d) a floor of 1.75% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, with a floor of 0.75%. For the year ended March 31, 2016, the average interest rate on the 2012 Term Loan was 4.4%.\nUnder the 2012 Term Loan, we were originally required to make quarterly payments each equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the 2012 Term Loan, with the balance expected to be due on the seventh anniversary of the closing date. However, since we have previously made significant optional payments that exceeded all of our required quarterly payments, we will not be required to make another payment until the maturity date of March 31, 2019.\nOn June 9, 2015, the Borrower entered into ABL Amendment No. 4. ABL Amendment No. 4 provides for (i) a $35.0 million increase in the accordion feature under the 2012 ABL Revolver and (ii) increased flexibility under the credit agreement governing the 2012 ABL Revolver, including additional investment, restricted payment, and debt incurrence flexibility and financial maintenance covenant relief and (iii) extended the maturity date of the 2012 ABL Revolver to June 9, 2020, which is five years from the effective date. We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the 2012 ABL Revolver at any time without a premium or penalty. For the year ended March 31, 2016, the average interest rate on the amounts borrowed under the 2012 ABL Revolver was 2.1%.\nOn February 4, 2016, in connection with the Bridge Credit Agreement (discussed below) and DenTek acquisition, the Company and the Borrower entered into ABL Amendment No. 5. ABL Amendment No. 5 temporarily suspends certain financial and related reporting covenants in the 2012 ABL Revolver until the earliest of (i) the date that is 60 calendar days following February 4, 2016, (ii) the date upon which certain of DenTek's assets are included in the Company's borrowing base under the 2012 ABL Revolver and (iii) the date upon which the Company receives net proceeds from an offering of debt securities of the Borrower or the Company.\n2013 Senior Notes:\nOn December 17, 2013, the Borrower issued $400.0 million of 2013 Senior Notes, with an interest rate of 5.375% and a maturity date of December 15, 2021. The Borrower may redeem some or all of the 2013 Senior Notes at redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 2013 Senior Notes. The 2013 Senior Notes are guaranteed by Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. and certain of its 100% domestic owned subsidiaries, other than the Borrower. Each of these guarantees is joint and several. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of any of the guarantors to obtain funds from their subsidiaries or to make payments to the Borrower or the Company. In connection with the 2013 Senior Notes offering, we incurred $7.2 million of costs, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the term of the 2013 Senior Notes.\n2016 Bridge Term Loans:\nOn February 4, 2016, Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. and the Borrower, entered into a bridge credit agreement. The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for the Bridge Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $80.0 million, at an applicable interest rate margin equal to (i) for the period beginning on the closing date and ending on the 179th day following the closing date, 4.75% for Eurocurrency rate loans and 3.75% for base rate loans, (ii) for the period from and including the 180th day following the closing date and ending on the 269th day following the closing date, 5.00% for Eurocurrency rate loans and 4.00% for base rate loans, and (iii) for the period from and after the 270th day following the closing date, 5.25% for Eurocurrency rate loans and 4.25% for base rate loans. The Bridge Term Loans would have matured on February 2, 2017. The proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisition of DenTek. However, as of March 31, 2016, there are no outstanding balances as the Company used the net proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes issuance (discussed below) to repay all of these Bridge Term Loans on February 19, 2016.\nIn connection with the repayment of the Bridge Loan on February 19, 2016, we expensed $1.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs which were classified as interest expense.\n2016 Senior Notes:\nOn February 19, 2016, the Borrower completed the sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2024 (the 2016 Senior Notes\u201d), pursuant to a purchase agreement, dated February 16, 2016, among the Borrower, the guarantors party thereto (the Guarantors\u201d) and the initial purchasers party thereto. The 2016 Senior Notes are guaranteed by Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. and certain of its domestic 100% owned subsidiaries, other than the Borrower. Each of these guarantees is joint and several. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to obtain funds from their subsidiaries or to make payments to the Borrower or the Company. In connection with the 2016 Senior Notes offering, we incurred $5.5 million of costs, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the term of the 2016 Senior Notes. The proceeds were used to primarily redeem the 2012 Senior Notes and repay the Bridge Term Loans that were utilized to partially fund the acquisition DenTek.\nThe 2016 Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated February 19, 2016 (the Indenture\u201d). The Indenture provides, among other things, that interest will be payable on the 2016 Senior Notes on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2016, until their maturity date of March 1, 2024. The 2016 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Borrower.\nThe Borrower has the option to redeem all or a portion of the 2016 Senior Notes at any time on or after March 1, 2019 at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Borrower may also redeem all or any portion of the 2016 Senior Notes at any time prior to March 1, 2019, at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, before March 1, 2019, the Borrower may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Senior Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture, provided that certain conditions are met. Subject to certain limitations, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the Indenture), The Borrower will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2016 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.\nRedemptions and Restrictions:\nOn February 19, 2016, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes issuance to redeem all of the 2012 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and repay all of the Bridge Term Loans.\nAt any time prior to December 15, 2016, we have the option to redeem the 2013 Senior Notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of notes redeemed, plus an applicable \"make-whole premium\" calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2013 Senior Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. On or after December 15, 2016, we have the option to redeem some or all of the 2013 Senior Notes at redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 2013 Senior Notes. In addition, at any time prior to December 15, 2016, we have the option to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.375% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings, provided that certain conditions are met. Subject to certain limitations, in the event of a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 2013 Senior Notes, the Borrower will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2013 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Senior Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.\nThe indentures governing the 2013 Senior Notes and the 2016 Senior Notes contain provisions that restrict us from undertaking specified corporate actions, such as asset dispositions, acquisitions, dividend payments, repurchases of common shares outstanding, changes of control, incurrences of indebtedness, issuance of equity, creation of liens, making of loans and transactions with affiliates. Additionally, the credit agreement with respect to the 2012 Term Loan and the 2012 ABL Revolver and the indentures governing the 2013 Senior Notes and the 2016 Senior Notes contain cross-default provisions, whereby a default pursuant to the terms and conditions of certain indebtedness will cause a default on the remaining indebtedness under the credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and the 2012 ABL Revolver and the indentures governing the 2013 Senior Notes and the 2016 Senior Notes. At March 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under our long-term indebtedness.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $1,652.5 million of outstanding indebtedness, which consisted of the following:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$400.0 million of 5.375% 2013 Senior Notes due 2021;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$350.0 million of 6.375% 2016 Senior Notes due 2024;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$817.5 million of borrowings under the 2012 Term B-3 Loans; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$85.0 million of borrowings under the 2012 ABL Revolver.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had $37.9 million of borrowing capacity under the 2012 ABL Revolver.\nAs we deem appropriate, we may from time to time utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates associated with our long-term debt obligations or other derivative financial instruments. While we have utilized derivative financial instruments in the past, we did not have any significant derivative financial instruments outstanding at either March 31, 2016 or March 31, 2015 or during any of the periods presented. We have not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes; all of our derivatives were over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.\nOur debt facilities contain various financial covenants, including provisions that require us to maintain certain leverage, interest coverage and fixed charge ratios. The credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and the 2012 ABL Revolver and the indentures governing the 2013 and 2016 Senior Notes contain provisions that accelerate our indebtedness on certain changes in control and restrict us from undertaking specified corporate actions, including asset dispositions, acquisitions, payment of dividends and other specified payments, repurchasing our equity securities in the public markets, incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens, making loans and investments and transaction with affiliates. Specifically, we must:\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Have a leverage ratio of less than 7.00 to 1.0 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 (defined as, with certain adjustments, the ratio of our consolidated total net debt as of the last day of the fiscal quarter to our trailing twelve month consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and certain other items ( EBITDA\u201d)).

Additionally, management anticipates that in the normal course of operations, we will be in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants during 2017. During the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made voluntary principal payments against outstanding indebtedness of $60.0 million, $130.0 million and $157.5 million, respectively, under the 2012 Term Loan. Under the Term Loan Amendment No. 2, we were required to make quarterly payments each equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term B-2 Loans, with the balance expected to be due on the seventh anniversary of the closing date. However, since we entered into Term Loan Amendment No. 3, we are required to make quarterly payment each equal to 0.25% of the aggregate amount of $852.5 million. Since we have previously made a significant optional payment that exceeded a significant portion of our required quarterly payments, we will not be required to make another payment until the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.\nEffective April 1, 2015, the Company elected to change its method of presentation relating to debt issuance costs in accordance with ASU 2015-03. Prior to 2016, the Company's policy was to present these costs in other-long term assets on the balance sheet, net of accumulated amortization. Beginning in 2016, the Company has presented these fees as a direct deduction to the related long-term debt. As a result, we reclassified $27.4 million of deferred financing costs as of March 31, 2015 from other long-term assets, and such costs are now presented as a direct deduction from the long-term debt liability.\nCommitments\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had ongoing commitments under various contractual and commercial obligations as follows:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 to 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,652.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,553.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>771.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory costs(2)\n</td> <td>119.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other costs(3)\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (4)\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations (5)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,568.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>217.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,718.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the estimated interest obligations on the outstanding balances at March 31, 2016 of the 2013 Senior Notes, 2016 Senior Notes, 2012 Term B-3 Loans, and 2012 ABL Revolver, assuming scheduled principal payments (based on the terms of the loan agreements) are made and assuming a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%.

More volatility in crude oil prices may have an adverse impact on transportation costs, as well as certain petroleum based raw materials and packaging material. Although we make efforts to minimize the impact of inflationary factors, including raising prices to our customers, a high rate of pricing volatility associated with crude oil supplies or other raw materials used in our products may have an adverse effect on our operating results.", "summary": "The report highlights the financial condition, operations, and acquisitions of a company engaged in the marketing and distribution of OTC healthcare and cleaning products.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or described by the forward-looking statements. Future results could differ materially from the discussion that follows for many reasons, including the factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as those described in future reports filed with the SEC.\nGeneral\nWe are engaged in the marketing, sales and distribution of well-recognized, brand name OTC healthcare and household cleaning products to mass merchandisers, drug stores, supermarkets, and club, convenience, and dollar stores in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets. We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage.\nWe have grown our brand portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. We develop our existing brands by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and strong advertising support. Acquisitions of OTC brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We have acquired strong and well-recognized brands from consumer products, pharmaceutical and private equity companies. While many of these brands have long histories of brand development and investment, we believe that, at the time we acquired them, most were considered non-core\u201d by their previous owners. As a result, these acquired brands did not benefit from adequate management focus and marketing support during the period prior to their acquisition, which created opportunities for us to reinvigorate these brands and improve their performance post-acquisition. After adding a core brand to our portfolio, we seek to increase its sales, market share and distribution in both existing and new channels through our established retail distribution network. We pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and promotional support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations, and innovative development of brand extensions.\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of DenTek\nOn February 5, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of DenTek, a privately-held marketer and distributor of specialty oral care products. The closing was finalized pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, announced November 23, 2015, under which the Company agreed to acquire DenTek from its stockholders, including TSG Consumer Partners, for a purchase price of $228.3 million. The acquisition expands the Company's portfolio of brands, strengthens its existing oral care platform and increases its geographic reach in parts of Europe. The Company financed the transaction with a combination of available cash on hand, available cash from its ABL revolver, and financing of an additional unsecured bridge loan. The DenTek brands are primarily included in our North American and International OTC Healthcare segments.\nThe DenTek acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes our preliminary allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the February 5, 2016 acquisition date.\n\nBased on this preliminary analysis, we allocated $179.8 million to non-amortizable intangible assets and $26.9 million to amortizable intangible assets. We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 18.5 years. The weighted average remaining life for amortizable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 was 18.4 years.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $76.5 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe pro forma effect of this acquisition on revenues and earnings was not material. However, revenues recorded during the period ended March 31, 2016 were $10.7 million since the date of the acquisition.\nAcquisition of Insight Pharmaceuticals\nOn September 3, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Insight , a marketer and distributor of feminine care and other OTC healthcare products, for $745.9 million in cash after receiving a return of approximately $7.2 million from escrow related to an arbitrator's ruling. The closing followed the FTC approval of the acquisition and was finalized pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement announced on April 25, 2014. Pursuant to the Insight purchase agreement, the Company acquired 27 OTC brands sold in North America (including related trademarks, contracts and inventory), which extended the Company's portfolio of OTC brands to include a leading feminine care platform in the United States and Canada anchored by Monistat, the leading North American brand in OTC yeast infection treatment. The acquisition also added brands to the Company's cough & cold, pain relief, ear care and dermatological platforms. In connection with the FTC's approval of the Insight acquisition, we sold one of the competing brands that we acquired from Insight on the same day as the Insight closing. Insight is primarily included in our North American OTC Healthcare segment.\nThe Insight acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we adjusted the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by increasing goodwill for certain immaterial items that came to our attention subsequent to the date of acquisition. Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we reduced goodwill, as we received $7.2 million as a result of a finalized arbitration ruling relating to a disputed working capital calculation as determined under GAAP, as of the date of the Insight acquisition, which is clearly and directly related to the purchase price. The following table summarizes our allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the September 3, 2014 acquisition date, after giving effect of the adjustments noted above.\n\nBased on this analysis, we allocated $599.6 million to indefinite-lived intangible assets and $124.8 million to amortizable intangible assets. We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 16.2 years. The weighted average remaining life for amortizable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 was 14.6 years.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $96.3 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired after of the adjustments described above. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe operating results of Insight have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning September 3, 2014. On September 3, 2014, we sold one of the brands we acquired from the Insight acquisition for $18.5 million, for which we had allocated $17.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.2 million to intangible assets, inventory and property, plant and equipment, respectively.\nThe following table provides our unaudited pro forma revenues, net income and net income per basic and diluted common share had the results of Insight's operations been included in our operations commencing on April 1, 2013, based upon available information related to Insight's operations. This pro forma information is not necessarily indicative either of the combined results of operations that actually would have been realized by us had the Insight acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the period for which the pro forma information is presented, or of future results.\n\nAcquisition of the Hydralyte brand\nOn April 30, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Hydralyte brand in Australia and New Zealand from The Hydration Pharmaceuticals Trust of Victoria, Australia, which was funded through a combination of cash on hand and our existing senior secured credit facility.\nHydralyte is the leading OTC brand in oral rehydration in Australia and is marketed and sold through our Care Pharma subsidiary. Hydralyte is available in pharmacies in multiple forms and is indicated for oral rehydration following diarrhea, vomiting, fever, heat and other ailments. Hydralyte is included in our International OTC Healthcare segment.\nThe Hydralyte acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes our allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the April 30, 2014 acquisition date.\n\nBased on this analysis, we allocated $73.6 million to non-amortizable intangible assets and no allocation was made to amortizable intangible assets.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $1.2 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe pro forma effect of this acquisition on revenues and earnings was not material.\nAcquisition of Care Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd.\nOn July 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Care Pharma, which was funded through a combination of our existing senior secured credit facility and cash on hand.\nThe Care Pharma brands include the Fess line of cold/allergy and saline nasal health products, which is the leading saline spray for both adults and children in Australia. Other key brands include Painstop analgesic, Rectogesic for rectal discomfort, and the Fab line of nutritional supplements. Care Pharma also carries a line of brands for children including Little Allergies, Little Eyes, and Little Coughs. The brands acquired are complementary to our OTC Healthcare portfolio.\nThis acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes our allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the July 1, 2013 acquisition date.\n\nBased on this analysis, we allocated $29.8 million to non-amortizable intangible assets and $1.7 million to amortizable intangible assets. We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 15.1 years. The weighted average remaining life for amortizable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 was 12.5 years.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $23.1 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. The full amount of goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe pro forma effect of this acquisition on revenues and earnings was not material.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While all significant accounting policies are important to our Consolidated Financial Statements, certain of these policies may be viewed as being critical. Such policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results from operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses or the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The most critical accounting policies are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the selling price is fixed or determinable; (iii) the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss; and (iv) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We have determined that these criteria are met and the transfer of risk of loss generally occurs when product is received by the customer, and, accordingly we recognize revenue at that time. Provisions are made for estimated discounts related to customer payment terms and estimated product returns at the time of sale based on our historical experience.\nAs is customary in the consumer products industry, we participate in the promotional programs of our customers to enhance the sale of our products. The cost of these promotional programs varies based on the actual number of units sold during a finite period of time. These promotional programs consist of direct-to-consumer incentives, such as coupons and temporary price reductions, as well as incentives to our customers, such as allowances for new distribution, including slotting fees, and cooperative advertising. Estimates of the costs of these promotional programs are based on (i) historical sales experience, (ii) the current promotional offering, (iii) forecasted data, (iv) current market conditions, and (v) communication with customer purchasing/marketing personnel. We recognize the cost of such sales incentives by recording an estimate of such cost as a reduction of revenue, at the\nlater of (a) the date the related revenue is recognized, or (b) the date when a particular sales incentive is offered. At the completion of the promotional program, these estimated amounts are adjusted to actual amounts. Our related promotional expense for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $56.4 million, $53.2 million, and $33.4 million, respectively. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we participated in over 26,000, 14,000, and 10,000 promotional campaigns, respectively. Of those campaigns, approximately 1,300, 1,900, and 1,700 payments were in excess of $5,000 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. For all three years, the average cost per campaign was less than $5,000. We believe that the estimation methodologies employed, combined with the nature of the promotional campaigns, make the likelihood remote that our obligation would be misstated by a material amount. However, for illustrative purposes, had we underestimated the promotional program rate by 10% for each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, our operating income would have been reduced by approximately $5.6 million, $5.3 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. Net income would have been adversely affected by approximately $3.6 million, $3.4 million, and $2.1 million, respectively.\nWe also periodically run coupon programs in Sunday newspaper inserts, on our product websites, or as on-package instant redeemable coupons. We utilize a national clearing house to process coupons redeemed by customers. At the time a coupon is distributed, a provision is made based upon historical redemption rates for that particular product, information provided as a result of the clearing house's experience with coupons of similar dollar value, the length of time the coupon is valid, and the seasonality of the coupon drop, among other factors. During 2016, we had 395 coupon events. The amount recorded against revenues and accrued for these events during the year was $5.6 million. Cash settlement of coupon redemptions during the year was $3.5 million.\nAllowances for Product Returns\nDue to the nature of the consumer products industry, we are required to estimate future product returns. Accordingly, we record an estimate of product returns concurrent with recording sales. Such estimates are made after analyzing (i) historical return rates, (ii) current economic trends, (iii) changes in customer demand, (iv) product acceptance, (v) seasonality of our product offerings, and (vi) the impact of changes in product formulation, packaging and advertising.\nWe construct our returns analysis by looking at the previous year's return history for each brand. Subsequently, each month, we estimate our current return rate based upon an average of the previous twelve months' return rate and review that calculated rate for reasonableness, giving consideration to the other factors described above. Our historical return rate has been relatively stable; for example, for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, returns represented 3.7%, 4.2% and 2.2%, respectively, of gross sales. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for sales returns was $10.7 million and $8.6 million, respectively.\nWhile we utilize the methodology described above to estimate product returns, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, causing our future financial results to be adversely affected. Among the factors that could cause a material change in the estimated return rate would be significant unexpected returns with respect to a product or products that comprise a significant portion of our revenues. Based on the methodology described above and our actual returns experience, management believes the likelihood of such an event remains remote. As noted, over the last three years our actual product return rate has stayed within a range of 2.2% to 4.2% of gross sales. A hypothetical increase of 0.1% in our estimated return rate as a percentage of gross sales would have decreased our reported sales and operating income for 2016 by approximately $0.9 million. Net income would have been reduced by approximately $0.6 million.\nLower of Cost or Market for Obsolete and Damaged Inventory\nWe value our inventory at the lower of cost or market value. Accordingly, we reduce our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.\nMany of our products are subject to expiration dating. As a general rule, our customers will not accept goods with expiration dating of less than 12 months from the date of delivery. To monitor this risk, management utilizes a detailed compilation of inventory with expiration dating between zero and 15 months and reserves for 100% of the cost of any item with expiration dating of 12 months or less. Inventory obsolescence costs charged to operations for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $2.6 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, or 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively, of net sales.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIn the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, which is based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable. In an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers' receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer's outstanding receivable balance.\nWe establish specific reserves for those accounts which file for bankruptcy, have no payment activity for 180 days, or have reported major negative changes to their financial condition. The allowance for bad debts amounted to 0.8% and 1.3% of accounts receivable at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Bad debt expense in each of the years 2016, 2015, and 2014 was less than approximately $0.3 million, representing less than 0.1% of net sales for each of 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nWhile management believes that it is diligent in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, an unexpected event, such as the bankruptcy filing of a major customer, could have an adverse effect on our financial results. A hypothetical increase of 0.1% in our bad debt expense as a percentage of net sales in 2016 would have resulted in a decrease of less than $0.1 million in reported operating income and reported net income.\nValuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nGoodwill and intangible assets amounted to $2,682.9 million and $2,425.4 million at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, goodwill and intangible assets were apportioned among similar product groups within our three operating segments as follows:\n\n\nThe increase in goodwill of $69.5 million for 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of DenTek, which increased goodwill by $76.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $7.2 million discussed below. On September 3, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Insight and recorded goodwill of $96.3 million, reflecting the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the preliminary estimate of fair value of net assets acquired, after giving effect to the following adjustments. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we increased goodwill by $0.3 million for certain immaterial items. During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we decreased goodwill by $7.2 million, as we received that amount from escrow pursuant to an arbitrator's ruling in December 31, 2015 related to a disputed working capital calculation, as determined under GAAP, associated with the Insight acquisition, which is clearly and directly related to the purchase price. The increase in the indefinite-lived intangible assets of $146.6 million for 2016 was due to the acquisition of DenTek, which increased indefinite-lived intangible assets by $179.8 million, and was offset by a reclassification of the Ecotrin brand to finite-lived of $32.9 million and $0.3 million due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in the finite-lived intangible assets of $41.4 million for 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of DenTek, which increased finite-lived brands by $26.9 million, the reclassification of the Ecotrin brand of $32.9 million from indefinite-lived, and was partially offset by amortization of $18.4 million.\nAt March 31, 2016, our highest valued brands were, Monistat, BC/Goody's, DenTek, Clear Eyes and Chloroseptic, comprising 52.2% of the intangible assets within the OTC Healthcare segments. The Comet, Chore Boy, and Spic and Span brands comprised all of the intangible assets value within the Household Cleaning segment.\nGoodwill and intangible assets comprise substantially all of our assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Intangible assets generally represent our trademarks, brand names and patents. When we acquire a brand, we are required to make judgments regarding the value assigned to the associated intangible assets, as well as their respective useful lives. Management considers many factors both prior to", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or described by the forward-looking statements. Future results could differ materially from the discussion that follows for many reasons, including the factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as those described in future reports filed with the SEC.\nGeneral\nWe are engaged in the marketing, sales and distribution of well-recognized, brand name OTC healthcare and household cleaning products to mass merchandisers, drug stores, supermarkets, and club, convenience, and dollar stores in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets. We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage.\nWe have grown our brand portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. We develop our existing brands by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and strong advertising support. Acquisitions of OTC brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We have acquired strong and well-recognized brands from consumer products, pharmaceutical and private equity companies. While many of these brands have long histories of brand development and investment, we believe that, at the time we acquired them, most were considered non-core\u201d by their previous owners. As a result, these acquired brands did not benefit from adequate management focus and marketing support during the period prior to their acquisition, which created opportunities for us to reinvigorate these brands and improve their performance post-acquisition. After adding a core brand to our portfolio, we seek to increase its sales, market share and distribution in both existing and new channels through our established retail distribution network. We pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and promotional support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations, and innovative development of brand extensions.\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of DenTek\nOn February 5, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of DenTek, a privately-held marketer and distributor of specialty oral care products. The closing was finalized pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, announced November 23, 2015, under which the Company agreed to acquire DenTek from its stockholders, including TSG Consumer Partners, for a purchase price of $228.3 million. The acquisition expands the Company's portfolio of brands, strengthens its existing oral care platform and increases its geographic reach in parts of Europe. The Company financed the transaction with a combination of available cash on hand, available cash from its ABL revolver, and financing of an additional unsecured bridge loan. The DenTek brands are primarily included in our North American and International OTC Healthcare segments.\nThe DenTek acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes our preliminary allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the February 5, 2016 acquisition date.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>February 5, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash acquired\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>9,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>14,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>3,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaids and other current assets\n</td> <td>6,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, plant and equipment, net\n</td> <td>3,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>76,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>206,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets acquired\n</td> <td>321,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>3,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued expenses\n</td> <td>16,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax liabilities - long term\n</td> <td>73,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>93,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total purchase price\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on this preliminary analysis, we allocated $179.8 million to non-amortizable intangible assets and $26.9 million to amortizable intangible assets. We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 18.5 years. The weighted average remaining life for amortizable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 was 18.4 years.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $76.5 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe pro forma effect of this acquisition on revenues and earnings was not material. However, revenues recorded during the period ended March 31, 2016 were $10.7 million since the date of the acquisition.\nAcquisition of Insight Pharmaceuticals\nOn September 3, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Insight , a marketer and distributor of feminine care and other OTC healthcare products, for $745.9 million in cash after receiving a return of approximately $7.2 million from escrow related to an arbitrator's ruling. The closing followed the FTC approval of the acquisition and was finalized pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement announced on April 25, 2014. Pursuant to the Insight purchase agreement, the Company acquired 27 OTC brands sold in North America (including related trademarks, contracts and inventory), which extended the Company's portfolio of OTC brands to include a leading feminine care platform in the United States and Canada anchored by Monistat, the leading North American brand in OTC yeast infection treatment. The acquisition also added brands to the Company's cough & cold, pain relief, ear care and dermatological platforms. In connection with the FTC's approval of the Insight acquisition, we sold one of the competing brands that we acquired from Insight on the same day as the Insight closing. Insight is primarily included in our North American OTC Healthcare segment.\nThe Insight acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we adjusted the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by increasing goodwill for certain immaterial items that came to our attention subsequent to the date of acquisition. Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we reduced goodwill, as we received $7.2 million as a result of a finalized arbitration ruling relating to a disputed working capital calculation as determined under GAAP, as of the date of the Insight acquisition, which is clearly and directly related to the purchase price. The following table summarizes our allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the September 3, 2014 acquisition date, after giving effect of the adjustments noted above.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>September 3, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash acquired\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>26,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>23,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax assets - current\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaids and other current assets\n</td> <td>1,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>2,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>96,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible assets\n</td> <td>724,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets acquired\n</td> <td>878,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>16,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued expenses\n</td> <td>8,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income tax liabilities - long term\n</td> <td>107,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liabilities assumed\n</td> <td>132,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total purchase price\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on this analysis, we allocated $599.6 million to indefinite-lived intangible assets and $124.8 million to amortizable intangible assets. We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 16.2 years. The weighted average remaining life for amortizable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 was 14.6 years.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $96.3 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired after of the adjustments described above. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe operating results of Insight have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning September 3, 2014. On September 3, 2014, we sold one of the brands we acquired from the Insight acquisition for $18.5 million, for which we had allocated $17.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.2 million to intangible assets, inventory and property, plant and equipment, respectively.\nThe following table provides our unaudited pro forma revenues, net income and net income per basic and diluted common share had the results of Insight's operations been included in our operations commencing on April 1, 2013, based upon available information related to Insight's operations. This pro forma information is not necessarily indicative either of the combined results of operations that actually would have been realized by us had the Insight acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the period for which the pro forma information is presented, or of future results.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Unaudited)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>783,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>767,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisition of the Hydralyte brand\nOn April 30, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Hydralyte brand in Australia and New Zealand from The Hydration Pharmaceuticals Trust of Victoria, Australia, which was funded through a combination of cash on hand and our existing senior secured credit facility.\nHydralyte is the leading OTC brand in oral rehydration in Australia and is marketed and sold through our Care Pharma subsidiary. Hydralyte is available in pharmacies in multiple forms and is indicated for oral rehydration following diarrhea, vomiting, fever, heat and other ailments. Hydralyte is included in our International OTC Healthcare segment.\nThe Hydralyte acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe pro forma effect of this acquisition on revenues and earnings was not material.\nAcquisition of Care Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd.\nOn July 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Care Pharma, which was funded through a combination of our existing senior secured credit facility and cash on hand.\nThe Care Pharma brands include the Fess line of cold/allergy and saline nasal health products, which is the leading saline spray for both adults and children in Australia. Other key brands include Painstop analgesic, Rectogesic for rectal discomfort, and the Fab line of nutritional supplements. Care Pharma also carries a line of brands for children including Little Allergies, Little Eyes, and Little Coughs. The brands acquired are complementary to our OTC Healthcare portfolio.\nThis acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.\nWe prepared an analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.

We are amortizing the purchased amortizable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted average useful life of 15.1 years. The weighted average remaining life for amortizable intangible assets at March 31, 2016 was 12.5 years.\nWe also recorded goodwill of $23.1 million based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. The full amount of goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe pro forma effect of this acquisition on revenues and earnings was not material.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While all significant accounting policies are important to our Consolidated Financial Statements, certain of these policies may be viewed as being critical. Such policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results from operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses or the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The most critical accounting policies are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the selling price is fixed or determinable; (iii) the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss; and (iv) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We have determined that these criteria are met and the transfer of risk of loss generally occurs when product is received by the customer, and, accordingly we recognize revenue at that time. Provisions are made for estimated discounts related to customer payment terms and estimated product returns at the time of sale based on our historical experience.\nAs is customary in the consumer products industry, we participate in the promotional programs of our customers to enhance the sale of our products. The cost of these promotional programs varies based on the actual number of units sold during a finite period of time. These promotional programs consist of direct-to-consumer incentives, such as coupons and temporary price reductions, as well as incentives to our customers, such as allowances for new distribution, including slotting fees, and cooperative advertising. Estimates of the costs of these promotional programs are based on (i) historical sales experience, (ii) the current promotional offering, (iii) forecasted data, (iv) current market conditions, and (v) communication with customer purchasing/marketing personnel. We recognize the cost of such sales incentives by recording an estimate of such cost as a reduction of revenue, at the\nlater of (a) the date the related revenue is recognized, or (b) the date when a particular sales incentive is offered. At the completion of the promotional program, these estimated amounts are adjusted to actual amounts. Our related promotional expense for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $56.4 million, $53.2 million, and $33.4 million, respectively. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we participated in over 26,000, 14,000, and 10,000 promotional campaigns, respectively. Of those campaigns, approximately 1,300, 1,900, and 1,700 payments were in excess of $5,000 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. For all three years, the average cost per campaign was less than $5,000. We believe that the estimation methodologies employed, combined with the nature of the promotional campaigns, make the likelihood remote that our obligation would be misstated by a material amount. However, for illustrative purposes, had we underestimated the promotional program rate by 10% for each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, our operating income would have been reduced by approximately $5.6 million, $5.3 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. Net income would have been adversely affected by approximately $3.6 million, $3.4 million, and $2.1 million, respectively.\nWe also periodically run coupon programs in Sunday newspaper inserts, on our product websites, or as on-package instant redeemable coupons. We utilize a national clearing house to process coupons redeemed by customers. At the time a coupon is distributed, a provision is made based upon historical redemption rates for that particular product, information provided as a result of the clearing house's experience with coupons of similar dollar value, the length of time the coupon is valid, and the seasonality of the coupon drop, among other factors. During 2016, we had 395 coupon events. The amount recorded against revenues and accrued for these events during the year was $5.6 million. Cash settlement of coupon redemptions during the year was $3.5 million.\nAllowances for Product Returns\nDue to the nature of the consumer products industry, we are required to estimate future product returns. Accordingly, we record an estimate of product returns concurrent with recording sales. Such estimates are made after analyzing (i) historical return rates, (ii) current economic trends, (iii) changes in customer demand, (iv) product acceptance, (v) seasonality of our product offerings, and (vi) the impact of changes in product formulation, packaging and advertising.\nWe construct our returns analysis by looking at the previous year's return history for each brand. Subsequently, each month, we estimate our current return rate based upon an average of the previous twelve months' return rate and review that calculated rate for reasonableness, giving consideration to the other factors described above. Our historical return rate has been relatively stable; for example, for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, returns represented 3.7%, 4.2% and 2.2%, respectively, of gross sales. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for sales returns was $10.7 million and $8.6 million, respectively.\nWhile we utilize the methodology described above to estimate product returns, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, causing our future financial results to be adversely affected. Among the factors that could cause a material change in the estimated return rate would be significant unexpected returns with respect to a product or products that comprise a significant portion of our revenues. Based on the methodology described above and our actual returns experience, management believes the likelihood of such an event remains remote. As noted, over the last three years our actual product return rate has stayed within a range of 2.2% to 4.2% of gross sales. A hypothetical increase of 0.1% in our estimated return rate as a percentage of gross sales would have decreased our reported sales and operating income for 2016 by approximately $0.9 million. Net income would have been reduced by approximately $0.6 million.\nLower of Cost or Market for Obsolete and Damaged Inventory\nWe value our inventory at the lower of cost or market value. Accordingly, we reduce our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.\nMany of our products are subject to expiration dating. As a general rule, our customers will not accept goods with expiration dating of less than 12 months from the date of delivery. To monitor this risk, management utilizes a detailed compilation of inventory with expiration dating between zero and 15 months and reserves for 100% of the cost of any item with expiration dating of 12 months or less. Inventory obsolescence costs charged to operations for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $2.6 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, or 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively, of net sales.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nIn the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, which is based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable. In an effort to reduce our credit risk, we (i) establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships, (ii) perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, (iii) monitor the payment history and aging of our customers' receivables, and (iv) monitor open orders against an individual customer's outstanding receivable balance.\nWe establish specific reserves for those accounts which file for bankruptcy, have no payment activity for 180 days, or have reported major negative changes to their financial condition. The allowance for bad debts amounted to 0.8% and 1.3% of accounts receivable at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Bad debt expense in each of the years 2016, 2015, and 2014 was less than approximately $0.3 million, representing less than 0.1% of net sales for each of 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nWhile management believes that it is diligent in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, an unexpected event, such as the bankruptcy filing of a major customer, could have an adverse effect on our financial results. A hypothetical increase of 0.1% in our bad debt expense as a percentage of net sales in 2016 would have resulted in a decrease of less than $0.1 million in reported operating income and reported net income.\nValuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nGoodwill and intangible assets amounted to $2,682.9 million and $2,425.4 million at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, goodwill and intangible assets were apportioned among similar product groups within our three operating segments as follows:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td>

in goodwill of $69.5 million for 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of DenTek, which increased goodwill by $76.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $7.2 million discussed below. On September 3, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Insight and recorded goodwill of $96.3 million, reflecting the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the preliminary estimate of fair value of net assets acquired, after giving effect to the following adjustments. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we increased goodwill by $0.3 million for certain immaterial items. During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we decreased goodwill by $7.2 million, as we received that amount from escrow pursuant to an arbitrator's ruling in December 31, 2015 related to a disputed working capital calculation, as determined under GAAP, associated with the Insight acquisition, which is clearly and directly related to the purchase price. The increase in the indefinite-lived intangible assets of $146.6 million for 2016 was due to the acquisition of DenTek, which increased indefinite-lived intangible assets by $179.8 million, and was offset by a reclassification of the Ecotrin brand to finite-lived of $32.9 million and $0.3 million due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in the finite-lived intangible assets of $41.4 million for 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of DenTek, which increased finite-lived brands by $26.9 million, the reclassification of the Ecotrin brand of $32.9 million from indefinite-lived, and was partially offset by amortization of $18.4 million.\nAt March 31, 2016, our highest valued brands were, Monistat, BC/Goody's, DenTek, Clear Eyes and Chloroseptic, comprising 52.2% of the intangible assets within the OTC Healthcare segments. The Comet, Chore Boy, and Spic and Span brands comprised all of the intangible assets value within the Household Cleaning segment.\nGoodwill and intangible assets comprise substantially all of our assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Intangible assets generally represent our trademarks, brand names and patents. When we acquire a brand, we are required to make judgments regarding the value assigned to the associated intangible assets, as well as their respective useful lives.
