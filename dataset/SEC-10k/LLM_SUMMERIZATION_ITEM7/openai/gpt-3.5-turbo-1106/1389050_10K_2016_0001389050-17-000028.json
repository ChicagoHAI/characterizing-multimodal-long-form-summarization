Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements, the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a pure play U.S. natural gas contract operations services business and the leading provider of natural gas compression services to customers in the oil and natural gas industry throughout the U.S. and a leading supplier of aftermarket services to customers that own compression equipment in the U.S. Our services are essential to the production, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and are provided primarily to producers and distributors of oil and natural gas. Our geographic business unit operating structure, technically experienced personnel and large fleet of natural gas compression equipment enable us to provide reliable contract operations services to our customers throughout the U.S.\nOur revenues and income are derived from two primary business segments:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Contract Operations. As of December 31, 2016, our contract operations business was largely comprised of our significant equity investment in Archrock Partners, L.P. and its subsidiaries, in addition to our owned fleet of natural gas compression equipment that we use to provide operations services to our customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Aftermarket Services. Our aftermarket services business provides a full range of services to support the compression needs of customers. We sell parts and components and provide operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services to customers who own compression equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nArchrock Partners, L.P.\nWe have a significant equity interest in the Partnership, a master limited partnership that provides natural gas contract operations services to customers throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2016, public unitholders held a 55% ownership interest in the Partnership and we owned the remaining equity interest, including all of the general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. We consolidate the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership. It is our intention for the Partnership to be the primary vehicle for the growth of our contract operations business and we may grow the Partnership through third-party acquisitions and organic growth. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership's fleet included 6,209 compressor units comprising approximately 3.3 million horsepower, or 86% of our and the Partnership's combined total U.S. horsepower.\nAcquisitions and Drop-Downs\nOn November 19, 2016, we sold to the Partnership contract operations customer service agreements with 63 customers and a fleet of 262 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements, comprising approximately 147,000 horsepower, or approximately 4% (of then available horsepower) of our and the Partnership's combined U.S. contract operations business. Total consideration for the transaction was $85.0 million, excluding transaction costs and consisted of the Partnership's issuance to us of approximately 5.5 million common units and approximately 111,000 general partner units. This acquisition of assets by the Partnership from us is referred to as the November 2016 Contract Operations Acquisition.\u201d\nOn March 1, 2016, the Partnership completed an acquisition of contract operations customer service agreements with four customers and a fleet of 19 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements comprising approximately 23,000 horsepower. The $18.8 million purchase price was funded with $13.8 million in borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility, a non-cash exchange of 24 Partnership compressor units for $3.2 million, and the issuance of 257,000 of the Partnership's common units for $1.8 million. In connection with this acquisition, the Partnership issued and sold to GP, our wholly owned subsidiary and the Partnership's general partner, 5,205 general partner units to maintain GP's approximate 2% general partner interest in the Partnership. This acquisition by the Partnership is referred to as the March 2016 Acquisition.\u201d\nOn April 17, 2015, we sold to the Partnership contract operations customer service agreements with 60 customers and a fleet of 238 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements, comprising approximately 148,000 horsepower, or 3% (of then available horsepower) of the combined contract operations business of the Partnership and us. The assets sold to the Partnership also included 179 compressor units, comprising approximately 66,000 horsepower, previously leased by us to the Partnership. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately $102.3 million, excluding transaction costs, and consisted of the Partnership's issuance to us of approximately 4.0 million common units and approximately 80,000 general partner units. Based on the terms of the contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement relating to the acquisition, the common units and general partner units, including incentive distribution rights, we received in this transaction were not entitled to receive a cash distribution relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2015. We refer to this acquisition as the April 2015 Contract Operations Acquisition.\u201d\nSpin-off Transaction\nOn November 3, 2015 (the Distribution Date\u201d), we completed the Spin-off of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses into a standalone public company operating as Exterran Corporation. To effect the Spin-off, we distributed on the Distribution Date, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of Exterran Corporation common stock to our stockholders as of October 27, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d). Archrock stockholders received one share of Exterran Corporation common stock for every two shares of our common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date. Upon the completion of the Spin-off, we were renamed Archrock, Inc.\u201d and, on November 4, 2015, the ticker symbol for our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was changed to AROC.\u201d Following the completion of the Spin-off, we and Exterran Corporation are independent, publicly traded companies with separate public ownership, board of directors and management, and we continue to own and operate the U.S. contract operations and aftermarket services businesses that we previously owned. Additionally, we continue to hold our interests in the Partnership, which include the sole general partner interest and certain limited partner interests, as well as all of the incentive distribution rights in the Partnership. Effective on the Distribution Date, the Partnership was renamed Archrock Partners, L.P.,\u201d and, on November 4, 2015, the ticker symbol for its common units on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was changed to APLP.\u201d\nIn order to effect the Spin-off and govern our relationship with Exterran Corporation after the Spin-off, we entered into several agreements with Exterran Corporation on the Distribution Date, including:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Separation and Distribution Agreement. Our separation and distribution agreement with Exterran Corporation contains the key provisions relating to the separation of our business from Exterran Corporation's business. The separation and distribution agreement identifies the assets and rights that were transferred, liabilities that were assumed or retained and contracts and related matters that were assigned to us or Exterran Corporation in the Spin-off and describes how these transfers, assumptions and assignments occurred. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement contains certain noncompetition provisions addressing restrictions for three years after the Spin-off on Exterran Corporation's ability to provide contract operations and aftermarket services in the United States and on our ability to provide contract operations and aftermarket services outside of the United States and to provide products for sale worldwide that compete with Exterran Corporation's product sales business, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, the separation and distribution agreement specifies our right to receive payments from a subsidiary of Exterran Corporation based on a notional amount corresponding to payments received by Exterran Corporation's subsidiaries from PDVSA Gas, a subsidiary of PDVSA, in respect of the sale of Exterran Corporation's subsidiaries' and joint ventures' previously nationalized assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Tax Matters Agreement. Our tax matters agreement with Exterran Corporation governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Exterran Corporation and us with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and certain other matters regarding taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Supply Agreement. Our supply agreement with Exterran Corporation sets forth the terms under which Exterran Corporation provides manufactured equipment, including the design, engineering, manufacturing and sale of natural gas compression equipment, on an exclusive basis to us and the Partnership. This supply agreement has an initial term of two years, subject to certain cancellation conditions, and is extendible for additional one-year terms by mutual agreement of the parties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of operations for Exterran Corporation have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements within Part IV, Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRestatement of Historical Financial Statements\nAs previously disclosed, on January 4, 2017, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Archrock, upon the recommendation of Archrock's management, determined that Archrock's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, including related reports of its independent registered public accounting firm, and the unaudited financial statements for each quarter of 2015 and 2014, should no longer be relied upon.\nThe determination that Archrock's financial statements for the periods listed above should no longer be relied upon was made by Archrock's Audit Committee and management after considering conclusions reached by Exterran Corporation that there were material errors in such historical periods relating to the application of percentage-of-completion accounting principles to certain Belleli engineering, procurement and construction ( EPC\u201d) contracts. Such conclusions were reached, in part, based on the results of an internal investigation into possible accounting irregularities involving the Belleli EPC business. These matters are discussed in detail in Exterran Corporation's Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed on January 4, 2017 and contains restated Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and related footnote disclosures as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (including unaudited quarterly periods within 2015 and 2014). In addition, Exterran Corporation's Form 10-K/A includes restated selected combined statement of operations data and other financial data for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and restated selected combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.\nArchrock's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and related financial information were restated in Archrock's Form 10-K/A, filed on February 9, 2017, to reflect adjustments for the accounting errors identified by Exterran Corporation's management.\nIn connection with the preparation and filing of the above-described restated financial statements, the Company's management, including our principal executive officer and current principal financial officer, determined that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the periods before the completion of the Spin-off on November 3, 2015. We view internal controls over financial reporting as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, Company management, including our principal executive officer and current principal financial officer, has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures in the periods before the completion of the Spin-off on November 3, 2015 were not effective. As a result of the Spin-off, management determined that certain risks and internal controls related to our former international operations, including Belleli EPC, were no longer relevant or necessary. The risks and certain internal controls associated with the material weaknesses noted above were among the risks and internal controls that were determined to be no longer relevant and therefore no remediation was necessary subsequent to the Spin-off on November 3, 2015.\nTrends and Outlook\nOur business environment and corresponding operating results are affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S. Spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is dependent upon these companies' forecasts regarding the expected future supply, demand and pricing of oil and natural gas products as well as their estimates of risk-adjusted costs to find, develop and produce reserves. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Our revenue, earnings and financial position are affected by, among other things, market conditions that impact demand and pricing for natural gas compression, our customers' decisions between using our services or our competitors' services, our customers' decisions regarding whether to own and operate the equipment themselves and the timing and consummation of any acquisition of additional contract operations customer service agreements and equipment from third parties. Although we believe our contract operations business is typically less impacted by commodity prices than certain other oil and natural gas service providers, changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our services.\nNatural gas consumption in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 0.6% to approximately 27,223 billion cubic feet ( Bcf\u201d) compared to approximately 27,395 Bcf for the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) forecasts that total U.S. natural gas consumption will increase by 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. The EIA estimates that the U.S. natural gas consumption level will be approximately 30 trillion cubic feet ( Tcf\u201d) in 2040, or 15% of the projected worldwide total of approximately 203 Tcf.\nNatural gas marketed production in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 1.2% to 28,380 Bcf compared to 28,725 Bcf for the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The EIA forecasts that total U.S. natural gas marketed production will increase by 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. The EIA estimates that the U.S. natural gas production level will be approximately 35 Tcf in 2040, or 17% of the projected worldwide total of approximately 202 Tcf.\nHistorically, oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity in the U.S. have been volatile. For example, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $3.71 per million British thermal unit ( MMBtu\u201d) at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 31% higher and 63% higher than prices at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the U.S. natural gas liquid composite price was $5.45 per MMBtu for the month of November 2016, which was approximately 4% higher and 29% higher than prices for the months of September 2016 and December 2015, respectively. While prices at December 31, 2016 improved relative to the comparable periods above, lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices during 2015 and 2016 as compared to 2014 prices caused many companies to reduce their natural gas drilling and production activities during 2015 and further reduce those activities during 2016 from their 2014 levels in select shale plays and in more mature and predominantly dry gas areas in the U.S., where we provide a significant amount of contract operations services. In addition, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price was $53.75 per barrel at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 13% higher and 45% higher than prices at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. While the price at December 31, 2016 improved relative to the comparable periods above, lower West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices during 2015 and 2016 as compared to 2014 prices resulted in a continued decrease in capital investment and in the number of new oil wells drilled by exploration and production companies in 2016 compared to 2015. Because we provide a significant amount of contract operations services related to the production of associated gas from oil wells and the use of gas lift to enhance production of oil from oil wells, our operations and our levels of operating horsepower are also impacted by crude oil drilling and production activity.\nAs a result of the reduction in capital spending and drilling activity by U.S. producers in 2016, we experienced a decline in operating horsepower and an increase in pricing pressure during 2016 compared to 2015, though we achieved improved contract operations gross margin percentage and lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable in part to our cost management efforts. The reduction in capital spending by our customers in 2016, as well as their delaying maintenance activity on their equipment and in some cases using internal resources to perform work they have historically outsourced, also caused our aftermarket services business to decline in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAccording to the Barclays 2017 Global E&P Spending Outlook, North America upstream spending is expected to increase by 27% in 2017. Due to the forecasted increase in customer spending in 2017, we anticipate horsepower returns will moderate during 2017 compared to 2016. We also anticipate investing more capital in new fleet units in 2017 than we did in 2016 to take advantage of expected improving market conditions during 2017. However, because compression service providers are a later cycle participant during improving markets, we anticipate any significant increase in the demand for our contract operations services will lag an increase in drilling activity. Also, given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in our contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016.\nCertain Key Challenges and Uncertainties\nIn addition to general market conditions in the oil and natural gas industry and competition in the natural gas compression industry we believe the following represent some of the key challenges and uncertainties we will face in the near future.\nU.S. Market Conditions. As a result of the reduction in capital spending and drilling activity by U.S. producers in 2016, we experienced a decline in operating horsepower and an increase in pricing pressure from our customers during 2016 compared to 2015, though we achieved improved contract operations gross margin percentage and lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable in part to our cost management efforts. The reduction in capital spending by our customers in 2016, as well as their delaying maintenance activity on their equipment and in some cases using internal resources to perform work they have historically outsourced, also caused our aftermarket services business to decline in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAlthough, according to the Barclays 2017 Global E&P Spending Outlook, North America upstream spending is expected to increase by 27% in 2017, because compression service providers are a later cycle requirement for improving market conditions, we anticipate any significant increase in the demand for our contract operations services will lag an increase in drilling activity. Also, given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in our contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016.\nDependence on the Partnership. To generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, fund our business and pay dividends, we depend heavily on the distributions attributable to our ownership interest in the Partnership. Our ownership interest in the Partnership, including our limited partner interest, general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in the Partnership, is a significant cash-generating asset for us. As a result, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of the Partnership to make distributions to its partners. Given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in the Partnership's contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016. A decline in the Partnership's business or revenues or increases in its expenses, principal and interest payments under existing and future debt instruments, working capital requirements or other cash needs could limit the amount of cash the Partnership has available to distribute to its unit holders, including us. A reduction in the amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership would reduce the amount of cash available to us for the payment of dividends, the payment of our debt and the funding of our business requirements.\nCapital Requirements and the Availability of External Sources of Capital. We anticipate investing more capital, particularly in new fleet units, in 2017 than we did in 2016 to take advantage of expected improving market conditions during 2017. In order to fund a significant portion of these capital expenditures, we expect to incur borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and we may issue additional debt or equity securities, as appropriate, given market conditions. We have a substantial amount of debt that could limit our ability to fund these capital expenditures. Also, although conditions in the capital and credit markets (both generally and in the oil and gas industry in particular) have improved since the significant decline in oil and natural gas prices in the third quarter of 2014, current conditions could limit our ability to access these markets to raise capital on affordable terms in 2017 and beyond. If we are not successful in raising capital within the time period required or at all, we may not be able to fund these capital expenditures, which could impair our ability to grow or maintain our business.\nCost Management. In January 2016, we determined to undertake a cost reduction program to reduce our on-going operating expenses in light of then current and expected activity levels. This cost reduction program helped to mitigate the impact of the overall decline in our contract operations and aftermarket services businesses during 2016 as a result of the low commodity price environment. However, maintaining cost reductions continues to be challenging, and there is no guarantee that our cost reduction program will continue to result in a reduction in our operating expenses or offset any declines in revenue in 2017.\nPersonnel, Hiring, Training and Retention. We believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be important. Although we have been able to satisfy our personnel needs thus far, retaining employees in our industry continues to be a challenge. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will depend in part on our success in hiring, training and retaining our employees.\nSummary of Results\nAs discussed in Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements, the results from continuing operations for all periods presented exclude the results of Exterran Corporation and our contract water treatment business. Those results are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nNet Income (loss) attributable to Archrock stockholders. We generated net loss attributable to Archrock stockholders of $54.6 million and $132.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net income attributable to Archrock Stockholders of $60.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net loss attributable to Archrock stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by the change in provision for (benefit from) income tax, decreases in long-lived asset impairment, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense and the change in net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. These changes were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin in both our Contract Operations and Aftermarket Services segments and a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net. The change in net income (loss) attributable to Archrock stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in income tax expense driven by a valuation allowance taken against foreign tax credits allocated to Exterran Corporation, an increase in long-lived asset impairment, a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. These activities were partially offset by an increase in gross margin in our contract operations segment and a decrease in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest.\nResults by Business Segment.

Average operating horsepower decreased by 11% from approximately 3,620,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 to approximately 3,234,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross margin decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in revenue explained above, partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales driven by a decrease in repair and maintenance expense and a decrease in lube oil expense. These cost decreases were primarily driven by the decrease in average operating horsepower explained above, a decrease in commodity prices and efficiency gains in lube oil consumption, and cost management initiatives. Gross margin percentage increased primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with the start-up of units, cost management initiatives and the decrease in lube oil explained above.\nAftermarket Services\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>132,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in customer demand for our services.

SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 14% and 13% during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense from assets fully reserved or retired, and assets impaired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we reviewed the future deployment of our idle compression assets used in our contract operations segment for units that were not of the type, configuration, condition, make or model that are cost efficient to maintain and operate. Based on this review, we determined that approximately 655 idle compressor units totaling approximately 262,000 horsepower would be retired from the active fleet during the year ended December 31, 2016. The retirement of these units from the active fleet triggered a review of these assets for impairment. As a result, we recorded a $76.6 million asset impairment to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value during the year ended December 31, 2016. The fair value of each unit was estimated based on either the expected net sale proceeds compared to other fleet units we recently sold and/or a review of other units recently offered for sale by third parties, or the estimated component value of the equipment we plan to use.\nIn connection with our fleet review during the year ended December 31, 2016, we evaluated for impairment idle units that had been culled from our fleet in prior years and were available for sale. Based upon that review, we reduced the expected proceeds from disposition for certain of the remaining units. This resulted in an additional impairment of $10.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we reviewed the future deployment of our idle compression assets used in our contract operations segment for units that were not of the type, configuration, condition, make or model that are cost efficient to maintain and operate. Based on this review, we determined that approximately 900 idle compressor units, representing approximately 371,000 horsepower, would be retired from the active fleet during the year ended December 31, 2015. The retirement of these units from the active fleet triggered a review of these assets for impairment. As a result, we recorded a $111.7 million asset impairment to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value during the year ended December 31, 2015. The fair value of each unit was estimated based on either the expected net sale proceeds compared to other fleet units we recently sold and/or a review of other units recently offered for sale by third parties, or the estimated component value of the equipment we plan to use.\nIn connection with our fleet review during 2015, we evaluated for impairment idle units that had been culled from our fleet in prior years and were available for sale. Based upon that review, we reduced the expected proceeds from disposition for certain of the remaining units. This resulted in an additional impairment of $13.3 million to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred $13.5 million of restatement-related charges primarily related to sharing a portion of professional expenses and legal fees incurred by Exterran Corporation with respect to the accounting matters described in Part II, Item 7 Restatement of Historical Financial Statements\u201d and the restatement of its pre-Spin-off historical financial statements. As discussed in Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements, the results of operations related to Exterran prior to the Spin-off are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations. In addition, the restatement charges include separate professional expenses and legal fees incurred by Archrock during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn the first quarter of 2016 we determined to undertake a cost reduction program to reduce our on-going operating expenses, including workforce reductions and closure of certain of our make-ready shops. These actions were a result of our review of our businesses and efforts to efficiently manage cost and maintain our businesses in line with then current and expected activity levels and anticipated make ready demand in the U.S market. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $13.3 million of restructuring and other charges as a result of this plan primarily related to severance benefits. These charges are reflected as restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of operations.\nAs discussed in Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements, we completed the Spin-off of Exterran Corporation on the Distribution Date. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $3.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively of costs associated with the Spin-off which were directly attributable to Archrock. These charges are reflected as restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of operations.\nIn the second quarter of 2015 we announced a cost reduction plan primarily focused on workforce reductions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $0.6 million of restructuring and other charges as a result of this plan primarily related to severance benefits. These charges are reflected as restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of operations.\nBeginning in late 2014 and extending throughout 2015, the energy markets experienced a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices which has had a significant impact on the financial performance and operating results of many oil and natural gas companies. Such declines accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2015, resulting in higher borrowing costs for companies and a substantial reduction in forecasted capital spending across the energy industry leading to lower projected growth rates over the short-term. Such declines impacted our future cash flow forecasts, our market capitalization, and the market capitalization of peer companies. We identified these conditions as a triggering event, which required us to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015. Accordingly, we recorded a full impairment of our remaining goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $3.7 million. During the first quarter of 2016, we finalized the impairment analysis which did not result in an adjustment to the impairment recognized.\nThe decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance of long-term debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 we incurred debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption of our 7.25% senior notes which included a $6.3 million call premium and $2.9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs.\nThe increase in other income, net during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $4.4 million increase in gain on sale of property, plant and equipment, a $2.9 million increase in our indemnification asset related to tax contingencies due from Exterran corporation, partially offset by a $0.6 million loss on non-cash consideration associated with the March 2016 Acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(146\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in our benefit from income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was a result of a valuation allowance and write off of tax attributes recorded in 2015, which were not required in 2016.

We generated $0.4 million of net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax compared to income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $33.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the operations of Exterran Corporation. The decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax is primarily due to the timing of the Spin-off of Exterran Corporation discussed above.\nThe results of Exterran Corporation include its previously nationalized Venezuelan joint venture assets and Venezuelan subsidiary assets which were sold to PDVSA Gas in 2012. Exterran Corporation received installment payments, including an annual charge, totaling $71.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn December 2013, we abandoned our contract water treatment business as part of our continued emphasis on simplification and focus on our core businesses. We generated loss from discontinued operations, net of tax of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to our contract water treatment business.\nNet (Income) Loss Attributable to the Noncontrolling Interest\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (income) loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,852\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(256\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe noncontrolling interest comprises the portion of the Partnership's earnings that are applicable to the Partnership's publicly-held limited partner interest.

The change in net (income) loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the change in net income (loss) of the Partnership which was primarily driven by a decrease in gross margin, an increase in long-lived asset impairments and increase in restructuring charges partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense and the goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Year ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2014\nContract Operations\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>781,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>319,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to an 8% increase in average operating horsepower, which included the assets acquired from MidCon Compression, L.L.C. in August 2014 (the August 2014 MidCon Acquisition\u201d) and in April 2014 (the April 2014 MidCon Acquisition\u201d). Gross margin (defined as revenue less cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and gross margin percentage increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in revenue attributable to the increase in average operating horsepower explained above and a decrease of $9.7 million in lube oil expenses resulting from a decrease in commodity prices and efficiency gains in lube oil consumption in the current year, offset by an increase in cost of sales attributable to the increase in average operating horsepower.\nAftermarket Services\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>175,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a decrease in service activities.

SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 13% and 14% during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to an increase in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets additions, including the assets acquired in the August 2014 MidCon Acquisition and the April 2014 MidCon Acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we reviewed the future deployment of our idle compression assets used in our contract operations segment for units that were not of the type, configuration, condition, make or model that are cost efficient to maintain and operate. Based on this review, we determined that approximately 900 idle compressor units, totaling approximately 371,000 horsepower would be retired from the active fleet during the year ended December 31, 2015. The retirement of these units from the active fleet triggered a review of these assets for impairment. As a result, we recorded a $111.7 million asset impairment to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value during the year ended December 31, 2015. The fair value of each unit was estimated based on either the expected net sale proceeds compared to other fleet units we recently sold and/or a review of other units recently offered for sale by third parties, or the estimated component value of the equipment we plan to use.\nIn connection with our fleet review during the year ended December 31, 2015, we evaluated for impairment idle units that had been culled from our fleet in prior years and were available for sale. Based upon that review, we reduced the expected proceeds from disposition for certain of the remaining units. This resulted in an additional impairment of $13.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we evaluated the future deployment of our idle fleet and determined to retire and either sell or re-utilize the key components of approximately 290 idle compressor units, representing approximately 112,000 horsepower, previously used to provide services in our contract operations segment. As a result, we performed an impairment review and recorded a $30.4 million asset impairment to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value. The fair value of each unit was estimated based on either the expected net sale proceeds compared to other fleet units we recently sold and/or a review of other units recently offered for sale by third parties, or the estimated component value of the equipment we plan to use.\nIn connection with our fleet review during 2014, we evaluated for impairment idle units that had been culled from our fleet in prior years and were available for sale. Based upon that review, we reduced the expected proceeds from disposition for certain of the remaining units. This resulted in an additional impairment of $11.7 million to reduce the book value of each unit to its estimated fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we evaluated other long-lived assets for impairment and recorded long-lived asset impairments of $0.7 million on these assets.\nAs discussed in Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements, we completed the Spin-off of Exterran Corporation on the Distribution Date. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $4.1 million of costs which were directly attributable to Archrock including retention and severance benefits and a non-cash inventory write-down. Non-cash inventory write-downs, which primarily related to the decentralization of shared inventory components between our contract operations business and the international contract operations business of Exterran Corporation, totaled $1.0 million. The costs related to the Spin-off have not been allocated to the segments because they primarily represent professional service fees within the corporate, finance and legal functions.\nIn the second quarter of 2015 we announced a cost reduction plan primarily focused on workforce reductions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $0.6 million of restructuring and other charges as a result of this plan primarily related to termination benefits. These charges are reflected as restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of operations.\nIn January 2014, we announced a plan to centralize our make-ready operations to improve the cost and efficiency of our shops and further enhance the competitiveness of our fleet of compressors. As part of this plan, we examined both then current and anticipated changes in the U.S. market, including the throughput demand of our shops and the addition of new equipment to our fleet. To better align our costs and capabilities with the then current market, we determined to close several of our make-ready shops. The centralization of our make-ready operations was completed in the second quarter of 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $5.4 million of restructuring charges primarily related to termination benefits and a non-cash write-down of inventory associated with the centralization of our make-ready operations. See Note 14 ( Restructuring and Other Charges\u201d) to our Financial Statements for further discussion of these charges.\nBeginning in late 2014 and extending throughout 2015, the energy markets experienced a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices which has had a significant impact on the financial performance and operating results of many oil and natural gas companies. Such declines accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2015, resulting in higher borrowing costs for companies and a substantial reduction in forecasted capital spending across the energy industry leading to lower projected growth rates over the short-term. Such declines impacted our future cash flow forecasts, our market capitalization, and the market capitalization of peer companies. We identified these conditions as a triggering event, which required us to perform a goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2015. Accordingly, we recorded a full impairment of our remaining goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $3.7 million.\nThe decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a decrease in the average effective interest rate on our debt, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of long-term debt. The decrease in the average effective interest rate was primarily due to the redemption of $355.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes (the 4.25% Notes\u201d), which including the debt discount had an effective interest rate of 11.67%, in the second quarter of 2014 with borrowings from our revolving credit facility.\nThe change in other income, net, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a $4.0 million decrease in gain on sale of property, plant and equipment partially offset by a decrease in expensed acquisition costs related to the August 2014 MidCon Acquisition and April 2014 MidCon Acquisition.\nIncome Taxes\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,066\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(290\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>(50.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(112.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to $90.8 million in tax expense recorded for the foreign tax credit write off and valuation allowances on the remaining foreign tax credits and state NOLs, which were allocated to Exterran Corporation upon completion of the Spin-off, and a $3.0 million state tax benefit recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014 for amendments to prior years' tax returns.\nDiscontinued Operations\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 includes the results of the Exterran Corporation businesses for periods prior to the Spin-off on the Distribution Date and results from our contract water treatment business.\nAs discussed in Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements, on the Distribution Date we completed the Spin-off of Exterran Corporation. We generated income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $33.8 million and $106.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the operations of Exterran Corporation. The decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax is primarily due to a decrease in gross margin in all of Exterran Corporation's segments, an increase in restructuring charges, including costs related to the Spin-off, an increase in foreign currency losses and an increase in long-lived asset impairment. These decreases were partially offset by decreases in SG&A, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. All of these factors were impacted by the timing of the Spin-off of Exterran Corporation and partial year results in the current year.\nThe results of Exterran Corporation include its previously-nationalized Venezuelan joint venture assets and Venezuelan subsidiary assets which were sold to PDVSA Gas in 2012. Exterran Corporation received installment payments, including an annual charge, totaling $71.8 million and $87.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn December 2013, we abandoned our contract water treatment business as part of our continued emphasis on simplification and focus on our core businesses. We generated loss from discontinued operations, net of tax of $0.1 million and $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively related to our contract water treatment business.\nNet Income Attributable to the Noncontrolling Interest\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (income) attributable to the noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,852\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoncontrolling interest comprises the portion of the Partnership's earnings that are applicable to the Partnership's publicly-held limited partner interest. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 public unitholders held an ownership interest in the Partnership of 59% and 63%, respectively. The decrease in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in long-lived asset impairment, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and the impairment of goodwill, along with our increased ownership percentage in the Partnership, partially offset by an increase in gross margin of the Partnership as a result of the April 2015 Contract Operations Acquisition, and inclusion of full year results from the August 2014 MidCon Acquisition and April 2014 MidCon Acquisition. Our ownership percentage of the Partnership increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the April 2015 Contract Operations Acquisition.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash balance was $3.1 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $1.6 million at December 31, 2015. Working capital decreased to $109.2 million at December 31, 2016 from $150.2 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) continuing operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(89,459\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(237,375\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(183,042\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(97,516\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discontinued operations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to decreased gross margins and an increase in restructuring and other charges, partially offset by changes in assets and liabilities, a decrease in interest paid and a decrease in SG&A expense.\nInvesting Activities. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $138.6 million in capital expenditures and an increase of $23.1 million in proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment during the current year period, partially offset by $13.8 million paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the March 2016 Acquisition.\nFinancing Activities. The increase in net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $430.9 million decrease in net contributions received from Exterran Corporation, partially offset by a $300.0 million decrease in net repayments of long-term debt and a $29.7 million decrease in distributions to noncontrolling partners in the Partnership.\nDiscontinued Operations. The decrease in net cash provided by discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the timing of the Spin-off of Exterran Corporation which was completed in November 2015.\nCapital Requirements. Our contract operations business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations. Our capital spending is primarily dependent on the demand for our contract operations services and the availability of the type of compression equipment required for us to render those contract operations services to our customers. Our capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and we anticipate will continue to consist of, the following:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>growth capital expenditures, which are made to expand or to replace partially or fully depreciated assets or to expand the operating capacity or revenue generating capabilities of existing or new assets, whether through construction, acquisition or modification; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintenance capital expenditures, which are made to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and related cash flows further extending the useful lives of the assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of our growth capital expenditures are related to the acquisition cost of new compressor units that we add to our fleet. In addition, growth capital expenditures can also include the upgrading of major components on an existing compressor unit where the current configuration of the compressor unit is no longer in demand and the compressor is not likely to return to an operating status without the capital expenditures. These latter expenditures substantially modify the operating parameters of the compressor unit such that it can be used in applications for which it previously was not suited. Maintenance capital expenditures are related to major overhauls of significant components of a compressor unit, such as the engine, compressor and cooler, that return the components to a like new condition, but do not modify the applications for which the compressor unit was designed.\nGrowth capital expenditures were $78.6 million, $154.5 million and $291.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in growth capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in investment in new compression equipment as a result of our customer's reduced capital spending as a result of the significant decline in oil and natural gas prices since the third quarter of 2014. We anticipate investing more capital in new fleet units in 2017 than we did in 2016 to take advantage of expected improving market conditions in 2017.\nMaintenance capital expenditures were $33.6 million, $75.0 million and $71.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in maintenance capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by our focus on disciplined capital spending in light of market conditions coupled with a decrease in average operating horsepower from 3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to 3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Maintenance capital expenditures remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of routine scheduled overhaul activities. We intend to grow our business both organically and through third-party acquisitions. If we are successful in growing our business in the future, we would expect our maintenance capital expenditures to increase over the long term.\nWe generally invest funds necessary to purchase fleet additions when our idle equipment cannot be reconfigured to economically fulfill a project's requirements and the new equipment expenditure is expected to generate economic returns over its expected useful life that exceeds our targeted return on capital. We currently plan to spend approximately $185 million to $205 million in net capital expenditures during 2017, primarily consisting of (1) approximately $125 million to $145 million on growth capital expenditures and (2) approximately $40 million to $45 million on equipment maintenance capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures are net of used fleet sales.\nOur Capital Structure Following the Spin-Off.\nIn October 2015, in connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a five-year, $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility will mature in November 2020. On the Distribution Date, we terminated our former credit facility and repaid $326.5 million in borrowings and accrued and unpaid interest outstanding on the repayment date.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, Exterran Corporation entered into a new $925.0 million credit facility, consisting of a $680.0 million revolving credit facility and a $245.0 million term loan facility (collectively, the Exterran Corporation Credit Facility\u201d) that became available on the Distribution Date. Exterran Corporation transferred the net proceeds from the borrowings under the Exterran Corporation Credit Facility to us to allow for our repayment of a portion of our indebtedness prior to the Spin-off.\nOn December 4, 2015, we redeemed for cash the $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior notes due December 2018 (the 7.25% Notes\u201d) at a redemption price equal to 101.813% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date.\nUnder our separation and distribution agreement with Exterran Corporation, we have the right to receive payments from a subsidiary of Exterran Corporation based on a notional amount corresponding to payments received by Exterran Corporation's subsidiaries from PDVSA Gas in respect of the sale of Exterran Corporation's subsidiaries' and joint ventures' previously nationalized assets. As of December 31, 2016, Exterran Corporation or its subsidiaries were due to receive the remaining principal amount of approximately $37.5 million from PDVSA Gas. In January 2017, Exterran Corporation received an additional installment payment, including an annual charge, of $19.7 million from PDVSA Gas relating to its subsidiaries' previously nationalized assets and transferred cash to us equal to that amount.\nAdditionally, we also have the right under the separation and distribution agreement to receive a $25.0 million cash payment from a subsidiary of Exterran Corporation promptly following the occurrence of a qualified capital raise as defined in the Exterran Corporation credit agreement.\nLong-Term Debt. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.4 billion in outstanding debt obligations net of unamortized debt discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs, consisting of $99.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, $509.5 million outstanding under the Partnership's revolving credit facility, $149.6 million outstanding under the Partnership's term loan facility, $342.4 million outstanding under the Partnership's 6% senior notes due April 2021 (the Partnership 2013 Notes\u201d) and $341.2 million outstanding under the Partnership's 6% senior notes due October 2022 (the Partnership 2014 Notes). After taking into account $10.0 million of guarantees through letters of credit, As of December 31, 2016, we had undrawn capacity of $241.0 million under our revolving credit facility. Our Credit Facility limits our Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) to not greater than 4.25 to 1.0. As a result of this limitation, $195.3 million of the $241.0 million of undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility was available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 2016.\nAs described above, in October 2015, in connection with the Spin-off, we entered into the Credit Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Credit Facility was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including (i) the payoff and termination of our former credit facility and (ii) the consummation of the Spin-off on or before January 4, 2016 (the date on which those conditions were satisfied is referred to as the Archrock Initial Availability Date\u201d). On November 3, 2015, we terminated our former credit facility, repaid $326.5 million in borrowings and accrued and unpaid interest outstanding on the repayment date and completed the Spin-off. Accordingly, the Archrock Initial Availability Date was November 3, 2015 and the Credit Facility will mature in November 2020.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), at our option, plus an applicable margin. Depending on our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), the applicable margin for revolving loans varies (i) in the case of LIBOR loans, from 1.75% to 2.75% and (ii) in the case of base rate loans, from 0.75% to 1.75%. The base rate is the highest of the prime rate announced by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. At December 31, 2016, all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility were LIBOR loans and the applicable margin was 1.75%. The weighted average annual interest rate at December 31, 2016 and 2015 on the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average daily debt balance under the Credit Facility was $130.7 million and $326.4 million, respectively.\nArchrock, Inc. (the Parent\u201d) and our Significant Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the credit agreement) guarantee the debt under the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the personal property assets and certain real property assets of the Parent and our Significant Domestic Subsidiaries, including all of the equity interests of our U.S. subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries). The Partnership does not guarantee the debt under the Credit Facility, its assets are not collateral under the Credit Facility and the general partner units in the Partnership are not pledged under the Credit Facility. Subject to certain conditions, at our request, and with the approval of the lenders, the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility may be increased by up to an additional $100 million.\nThe Credit Facility contains various covenants with which we or certain of our subsidiaries must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, liens on assets, repurchasing equity and making distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. We are also subject to financial covenants, including a ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to Total Interest Expense (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than 2.25 to 1.0, a ratio of consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to EBITDA of not greater than 4.25 to 1.0 (subject to a temporary increase to 4.75 to 1.0 for any quarter during which an acquisition meeting certain thresholds is completed and for the following two quarters after the acquisition closes). As of December 31, 2016, we maintained a 27.2 to 1.0 EBITDA to Total Interest Expense ratio and a 1.4 to 1.0 consolidated Total Debt to EBITDA ratio. If we were to anticipate non-compliance with these financial ratios, we may take actions to maintain compliance with them, possibly including reductions in our general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures or the payment of cash dividends at our current dividend rate. If we fail to remain in compliance with our financial covenants we would be in default under our debt agreements. A default under one or more of our debt agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under certain of our other debt agreements, which would accelerate our obligation to repay our indebtedness under those agreements. In addition, if we experience a material adverse effect on our assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impacts our ability to perform our obligations under our debt agreements, this could lead to a default under our debt agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility.\nAs a result of the accounting issues giving rise to the restatement described in Part II, Item 7 ( Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on May 10, 2016, July 21, 2016, September 21, 2016 and December 9, 2016, we entered into amendments to the Credit Facility (as amended, the Amended Credit Facility\u201d) with Wells Fargo, as the administrative agent, and various financial institutions as lenders.\nUnder the Amended Credit Facility, the lenders waived, among other things, (1) any potential event of default arising under the Credit Facility as a result of the potential inaccuracy of certain representations and warranties regarding our prior period financial information and previously delivered compliance certificate for the 2015 fiscal year and (2) any requirement that we make any representations and warranties as to our prior period financial statements and other prior period financial information. The Amended Credit Facility extended the deadline to no later than March 31, 2017 by which we were required to deliver to the lenders our quarterly reports for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 and the related compliance certificates demonstrating compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Credit Facility. On February 14, 2017, we delivered our 2016 quarterly reports and the related compliance certificates to the lenders.\nThe Amended Credit Facility also, among other things:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>added a condition precedent to the borrowing of loans that, after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of each borrowing, our consolidated cash balance (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) will not exceed $35,000,000; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>added a requirement that if our consolidated cash balance (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) exceeds $35,000,000 as of the end of any business day, then we prepay any revolving loans then outstanding in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) such excess amount and (ii) the aggregate amount of the revolving loans then outstanding.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn November 2010, the Partnership amended and restated the Partnership Credit Agreement to provide for a five-year $550.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $400.0 million revolving credit facility and a $150.0 million term loan facility. The revolving borrowing capacity under this facility increased to $550.0 million in March 2011 and to $750.0 million in March 2012. The Partnership amended the Partnership Credit Agreement in March 2013 to reduce the borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility to $650.0 million and extend the maturity date of the term loan and revolving credit facilities to May 2018. In February 2015, the Partnership amended the Partnership Credit Agreement, which among other things, increased its borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to $900.0 million. In May 2016, the Partnership further amended the Partnership Credit Agreement to, among other things, decrease the borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility to $825.0 million. Prior to this amendment, the Partnership was able to increase the aggregate commitments under the Partnership Credit Agreement by up to an additional $50 million subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the lenders. As a result of this amendment and subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the lenders, the Partnership is able to increase the aggregate commitments under the Partnership Credit Agreement by up to an additional $125 million. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership had undrawn and available capacity of $315.5 million under its revolving credit facility.\nThe Partnership's revolving credit and term loan facilities bear interest at a base rate or LIBOR, at the Partnership's option, plus an applicable margin. Depending on the Partnership's leverage ratio, the applicable margin for the revolving and term loans varies (i) in the case of LIBOR loans, from 2.0% to 3.0% and (ii) in the case of base rate loans, from 1.0% to 2.0%. The base rate is the highest of the prime rate announced by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% and one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. At December 31, 2016, all amounts outstanding under these facilities were LIBOR loans and the applicable margin was 3.0%. The weighted average annual interest rate on the outstanding balance under these facilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015, excluding the effect of interest rate swaps, was 3.7% and 2.8%, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average daily debt balance under these facilities was $723.3 million and $667.3 million, respectively.\nBorrowings under the Partnership Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the U.S. personal property assets of the Partnership and its Significant Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement), including all of the membership interests of the Partnership's Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement).\nThe Partnership Credit Agreement contains various covenants with which the Partnership must comply, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of proceeds from borrowings and limitations on the Partnership's ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate, sell assets, make certain investments and acquisitions, make loans, grant liens, repurchase equity and pay dividends and distributions. The Partnership Credit Agreement also contains various covenants, which have been amended effective March 31, 2016, requiring mandatory prepayments from the net cash proceeds of certain asset transfers. In addition, if as of any date the Partnership has cash and cash equivalents (other than proceeds from a debt or equity issuance in the 30 days prior to such date reasonably expected to be used to fund an acquisition permitted under the Partnership Credit Agreement) in excess of $50.0 million, then such excess amount will be used to pay down outstanding borrowings of a corresponding amount under the revolving credit facility.\nThe Partnership must maintain various consolidated financial ratios, including a ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) to Total Interest Expense (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.75 to 1.0, a ratio of Total Debt (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) to EBITDA of not greater than 5.95 to 1.0 through the fourth quarter of 2017, 5.75 to 1.0 in the first quarter of 2018, and 5.25 to 1.0 (subject to a temporary increase to 5.5 to 1.0 for any quarter during which an acquisition meeting certain thresholds is completed and for the following two quarters after the acquisition closes) thereafter and a ratio of Senior Secured Debt (as defined in the Partnership Credit Agreement) to EBITDA of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0 through the fourth quarter of 2017, 3.75 to 1.0 in the first quarter of 2018 and 4.0 to 1.0 thereafter. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership maintained a 3.9 to 1.0 EBITDA to Total Interest Expense ratio, 4.7 to 1.0 Total Debt to EBITDA ratio and a 2.3 to 1.0 Senior Secured Debt to EBITDA ratio. If the Partnership were to anticipate non-compliance with these financial ratios, the Partnership may take actions to maintain compliance with them, including a reduction in general and administrative expenses, its capital expenditures or the payment of cash distributions at its current distribution rate to its unit holders, including us. A reduction in the amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership would reduce the amount of cash available for payment of our debt, payment of dividends and the funding of our business requirements. A default under one of the Partnership's debt agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under the Partnership's other debt agreements, which would accelerate the Partnership's obligation to repay its indebtedness under those agreements. In addition, a material adverse effect with respect to the Partnership's assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impacts the Partnership's ability to perform its obligations under the Partnership Credit Agreement, could lead to a default under that agreement. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Partnership Credit Agreement.\nIn March 2013, the Partnership issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Partnership 2013 Notes. The Partnership used the net proceeds of $336.9 million, after original issuance discount and issuance costs, to repay borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The Partnership 2013 Notes were issued at an original issuance discount of $5.5 million, which is being amortized using the effective interest method at an interest rate of 6.25% over their term. In January 2014, holders of the Partnership 2013 Notes exchanged their Partnership 2013 Notes for registered notes with the same terms.\nPrior to April 1, 2017, the Partnership may redeem all or a part of the Partnership 2013 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) a make-whole premium at the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. On or after April 1, 2017, the Partnership may redeem all or a part of the Partnership 2013 Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 103.00% for the twelve-month period beginning on April 1, 2017, 101.500% for the twelve-month period beginning on April 1, 2018 and 100.00% for the twelve-month period beginning on April 1, 2019 and at any time thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the applicable redemption date of the Partnership 2013 Notes.\nIn April 2014, the Partnership issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Partnership 2014 Notes. The Partnership received net proceeds of $337.4 million, after original issuance discount and issuance costs, from this offering, which it used to fund a portion of the April 2014 MidCon Acquisition and repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The Partnership 2014 Notes were issued at an original issuance discount of $5.7 million, which is being amortized using the effective interest method at an interest rate of 6.25% over their term. In February 2015, holders of the Partnership 2014 Notes exchanged their Partnership 2014 Notes for registered notes with the same terms.\nPrior to April 1, 2018, the Partnership may redeem all or a part of the Partnership 2014 Notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) a make-whole premium at the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, the Partnership may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Partnership 2014 Notes prior to April 1, 2017 with the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a redemption price of 106.00% of the principal amount of the Partnership 2014 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Partnership 2014 Notes issued under the indenture remains outstanding after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such equity offering. On or after April 1, 2018, the Partnership may redeem all or a part of the Partnership 2014 Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 103.00% for the twelve-month period beginning on April 1, 2018, 101.500% for the twelve-month period beginning on April 1, 2019 and 100.00% for the twelve-month period beginning on April 1, 2020 and at any time thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the applicable redemption date of the Partnership 2014 Notes.\nThe Partnership 2013 Notes and the Partnership 2014 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Partnership's existing subsidiaries (other than Archrock Partners Finance Corp., which is a co-issuer of the Partnership 2013 Notes and the Partnership 2014 Notes) and certain of the Partnership's future subsidiaries. The Partnership 2013 Notes and the Partnership 2014 Notes and the guarantees, respectively, are the Partnership's and the guarantors' general unsecured senior obligations, rank equally in right of payment with all of the Partnership's and the guarantors' other senior obligations, and are effectively subordinated to all of the Partnership's and the guarantors' existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. In addition, the Partnership 2013 Notes and the Partnership 2014 Notes and guarantees are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any future non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nThe Partnership has entered into interest rate swap agreements to offset changes in expected cash flows due to fluctuations in the interest rates associated with its variable rate debt. At December 31, 2016, the Partnership was a party to interest rate swaps with a notional value of $500.0 million pursuant to which it makes fixed payments and receives floating payments. The Partnership's interest rate swaps expire over varying dates, with interest rate swaps having a notional amount of $300.0 million expiring in May 2018, interest rate swaps having a notional amount of $100.0 million expiring in May 2019 and the remaining interest rate swaps having a notional amount of $100.0 million expiring in May 2020. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted average effective fixed interest rate on the interest rate swaps was 1.6%.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements, the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a pure play U.S. natural gas contract operations services business and the leading provider of natural gas compression services to customers in the oil and natural gas industry throughout the U.S. and a leading supplier of aftermarket services to customers that own compression equipment in the U.S. Our services are essential to the production, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and are provided primarily to producers and distributors of oil and natural gas. Our geographic business unit operating structure, technically experienced personnel and large fleet of natural gas compression equipment enable us to provide reliable contract operations services to our customers throughout the U.S.\nOur revenues and income are derived from two primary business segments:\n \u2022 Contract Operations. As of December 31, 2016, our contract operations business was largely comprised of our significant equity investment in Archrock Partners, L.P. and its subsidiaries, in addition to our owned fleet of natural gas compression equipment that we use to provide operations services to our customers. \n \u2022 Aftermarket Services. Our aftermarket services business provides a full range of services to support the compression needs of customers. We sell parts and components and provide operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services to customers who own compression equipment. \nArchrock Partners, L.P.\nWe have a significant equity interest in the Partnership, a master limited partnership that provides natural gas contract operations services to customers throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2016, public unitholders held a 55% ownership interest in the Partnership and we owned the remaining equity interest, including all of the general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. We consolidate the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership. It is our intention for the Partnership to be the primary vehicle for the growth of our contract operations business and we may grow the Partnership through third-party acquisitions and organic growth. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership's fleet included 6,209 compressor units comprising approximately 3.3 million horsepower, or 86% of our and the Partnership's combined total U.S. horsepower.\nAcquisitions and Drop-Downs\nOn November 19, 2016, we sold to the Partnership contract operations customer service agreements with 63 customers and a fleet of 262 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements, comprising approximately 147,000 horsepower, or approximately 4% (of then available horsepower) of our and the Partnership's combined U.S. contract operations business. Total consideration for the transaction was $85.0 million, excluding transaction costs and consisted of the Partnership's issuance to us of approximately 5.5 million common units and approximately 111,000 general partner units. This acquisition of assets by the Partnership from us is referred to as the November 2016 Contract Operations Acquisition.\u201d\nOn March 1, 2016, the Partnership completed an acquisition of contract operations customer service agreements with four customers and a fleet of 19 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements comprising approximately 23,000 horsepower. The $18.8 million purchase price was funded with $13.8 million in borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility, a non-cash exchange of 24 Partnership compressor units for $3.2 million, and the issuance of 257,000 of the Partnership's common units for $1.8 million. In connection with this acquisition, the Partnership issued and sold to GP, our wholly owned subsidiary and the Partnership's general partner, 5,205 general partner units to maintain GP's approximate 2% general partner interest in the Partnership. This acquisition by the Partnership is referred to as the March 2016 Acquisition.\u201d\nOn April 17, 2015, we sold to the Partnership contract operations customer service agreements with 60 customers and a fleet of 238 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements, comprising approximately 148,000 horsepower, or 3% (of then available horsepower) of the combined contract operations business of the Partnership and us. The assets sold to the Partnership also included 179 compressor units, comprising approximately 66,000 horsepower, previously leased by us to the Partnership. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately $102.3 million, excluding transaction costs, and consisted of the Partnership's issuance to us of approximately 4.0 million common units and approximately 80,000 general partner units. Based on the terms of the contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement relating to the acquisition, the common units and general partner units, including incentive distribution rights, we received in this transaction were not entitled to receive a cash distribution relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2015. We refer to this acquisition as the April 2015 Contract Operations Acquisition.\u201d\nSpin-off Transaction\nOn November 3, 2015 (the Distribution Date\u201d), we completed the Spin-off of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses into a standalone public company operating as Exterran Corporation. To effect the Spin-off, we distributed on the Distribution Date, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of Exterran Corporation common stock to our stockholders as of October 27, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d). Archrock stockholders received one share of Exterran Corporation common stock for every two shares of our common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date. Upon the completion of the Spin-off, we were renamed Archrock, Inc.\u201d and, on November 4, 2015, the ticker symbol for our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was changed to AROC.\u201d Following the completion of the Spin-off, we and Exterran Corporation are independent, publicly traded companies with separate public ownership, board of directors and management, and we continue to own and operate the U.S. contract operations and aftermarket services businesses that we previously owned. Additionally, we continue to hold our interests in the Partnership, which include the sole general partner interest and certain limited partner interests, as well as all of the incentive distribution rights in the Partnership. Effective on the Distribution Date, the Partnership was renamed Archrock Partners, L.P.,\u201d and, on November 4, 2015, the ticker symbol for its common units on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was changed to APLP.\u201d\nIn order to effect the Spin-off and govern our relationship with Exterran Corporation after the Spin-off, we entered into several agreements with Exterran Corporation on the Distribution Date, including:\n \u2022 Separation and Distribution Agreement. Our separation and distribution agreement with Exterran Corporation contains the key provisions relating to the separation of our business from Exterran Corporation's business. The separation and distribution agreement identifies the assets and rights that were transferred, liabilities that were assumed or retained and contracts and related matters that were assigned to us or Exterran Corporation in the Spin-off and describes how these transfers, assumptions and assignments occurred. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement contains certain noncompetition provisions addressing restrictions for three years after the Spin-off on Exterran Corporation's ability to provide contract operations and aftermarket services in the United States and on our ability to provide contract operations and aftermarket services outside of the United States and to provide products for sale worldwide that compete with Exterran Corporation's product sales business, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, the separation and distribution agreement specifies our right to receive payments from a subsidiary of Exterran Corporation based on a notional amount corresponding to payments received by Exterran Corporation's subsidiaries from PDVSA Gas, a subsidiary of PDVSA, in respect of the sale of Exterran Corporation's subsidiaries' and joint ventures' previously nationalized assets. \n \u2022 Tax Matters Agreement. Our tax matters agreement with Exterran Corporation governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Exterran Corporation and us with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and certain other matters regarding taxes. \n \u2022 Supply Agreement. Our supply agreement with Exterran Corporation sets forth the terms under which Exterran Corporation provides manufactured equipment, including the design, engineering, manufacturing and sale of natural gas compression equipment, on an exclusive basis to us and the Partnership. This supply agreement has an initial term of two years, subject to certain cancellation conditions, and is extendible for additional one-year terms by mutual agreement of the parties. \nResults of operations for Exterran Corporation have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements within Part IV, Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRestatement of Historical Financial Statements\nAs previously disclosed, on January 4, 2017, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Archrock, upon the recommendation of Archrock's management, determined that Archrock's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, including related reports of its independent registered public accounting firm, and the unaudited financial statements for each quarter of 2015 and 2014, should no longer be relied upon.\nThe determination that Archrock's financial statements for the periods listed above should no longer be relied upon was made by Archrock's Audit Committee and management after considering conclusions reached by Exterran Corporation that there were material errors in such historical periods relating to the application of percentage-of-completion accounting principles to certain Belleli engineering, procurement and construction ( EPC\u201d) contracts. Such conclusions were reached, in part, based on the results of an internal investigation into possible accounting irregularities involving the Belleli EPC business. These matters are discussed in detail in Exterran Corporation's Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed on January 4, 2017 and contains restated Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and related footnote disclosures as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (including unaudited quarterly periods within 2015 and 2014). In addition, Exterran Corporation's Form 10-K/A includes restated selected combined statement of operations data and other financial data for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and restated selected combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.\nArchrock's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and related financial information were restated in Archrock's Form 10-K/A, filed on February 9, 2017, to reflect adjustments for the accounting errors identified by Exterran Corporation's management.\nIn connection with the preparation and filing of the above-described restated financial statements, the Company's management, including our principal executive officer and current principal financial officer, determined that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the periods before the completion of the Spin-off on November 3, 2015. We view internal controls over financial reporting as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, Company management, including our principal executive officer and current principal financial officer, has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures in the periods before the completion of the Spin-off on November 3, 2015 were not effective. As a result of the Spin-off, management determined that certain risks and internal controls related to our former international operations, including Belleli EPC, were no longer relevant or necessary. The risks and certain internal controls associated with the material weaknesses noted above were among the risks and internal controls that were determined to be no longer relevant and therefore no remediation was necessary subsequent to the Spin-off on November 3, 2015.\nTrends and Outlook\nOur business environment and corresponding operating results are affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S. Spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is dependent upon these companies' forecasts regarding the expected future supply, demand and pricing of oil and natural gas products as well as their estimates of risk-adjusted costs to find, develop and produce reserves. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Our revenue, earnings and financial position are affected by, among other things, market conditions that impact demand and pricing for natural gas compression, our customers' decisions between using our services or our competitors' services, our customers' decisions regarding whether to own and operate the equipment themselves and the timing and consummation of any acquisition of additional contract operations customer service agreements and equipment from third parties. Although we believe our contract operations business is typically less impacted by commodity prices than certain other oil and natural gas service providers, changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our services.\nNatural gas consumption in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 0.6% to approximately 27,223 billion cubic feet ( Bcf\u201d) compared to approximately 27,395 Bcf for the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) forecasts that total U.S. natural gas consumption will increase by 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. The EIA estimates that the U.S. natural gas consumption level will be approximately 30 trillion cubic feet ( Tcf\u201d) in 2040, or 15% of the projected worldwide total of approximately 203 Tcf.\nNatural gas marketed production in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 1.2% to 28,380 Bcf compared to 28,725 Bcf for the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The EIA forecasts that total U.S. natural gas marketed production will increase by 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. The EIA estimates that the U.S. natural gas production level will be approximately 35 Tcf in 2040, or 17% of the projected worldwide total of approximately 202 Tcf.\nHistorically, oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity in the U.S. have been volatile. For example, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $3.71 per million British thermal unit ( MMBtu\u201d) at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 31% higher and 63% higher than prices at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the U.S. natural gas liquid composite price was $5.45 per MMBtu for the month of November 2016, which was approximately 4% higher and 29% higher than prices for the months of September 2016 and December 2015, respectively. While prices at December 31, 2016 improved relative to the comparable periods above, lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices during 2015 and 2016 as compared to 2014 prices caused many companies to reduce their natural gas drilling and production activities during 2015 and further reduce those activities during 2016 from their 2014 levels in select shale plays and in more mature and predominantly dry gas areas in the U.S., where we provide a significant amount of contract operations services. In addition, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price was $53.75 per barrel at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 13% higher and 45% higher than prices at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. While the price at December 31, 2016 improved relative to the comparable periods above, lower West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices during 2015 and 2016 as compared to 2014 prices resulted in a continued decrease in capital investment and in the number of new oil wells drilled by exploration and production companies in 2016 compared to 2015. Because we provide a significant amount of contract operations services related to the production of associated gas from oil wells and the use of gas lift to enhance production of oil from oil wells, our operations and our levels of operating horsepower are also impacted by crude oil drilling and production activity.\nAs a result of the reduction in capital spending and drilling activity by U.S. producers in 2016, we experienced a decline in operating horsepower and an increase in pricing pressure during 2016 compared to 2015, though we achieved improved contract operations gross margin percentage and lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable in part to our cost management efforts. The reduction in capital spending by our customers in 2016, as well as their delaying maintenance activity on their equipment and in some cases using internal resources to perform work they have historically outsourced, also caused our aftermarket services business to decline in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAccording to the Barclays 2017 Global E&P Spending Outlook, North America upstream spending is expected to increase by 27% in 2017. Due to the forecasted increase in customer spending in 2017, we anticipate horsepower returns will moderate during 2017 compared to 2016. We also anticipate investing more capital in new fleet units in 2017 than we did in 2016 to take advantage of expected improving market conditions during 2017. However, because compression service providers are a later cycle participant during improving markets, we anticipate any significant increase in the demand for our contract operations services will lag an increase in drilling activity. Also, given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in our contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016.\nCertain Key Challenges and Uncertainties\nIn addition to general market conditions in the oil and natural gas industry and competition in the natural gas compression industry we believe the following represent some of the key challenges and uncertainties we will face in the near future.\nU.S. Market Conditions. As a result of the reduction in capital spending and drilling activity by U.S. producers in 2016, we experienced a decline in operating horsepower and an increase in pricing pressure from our customers during 2016 compared to 2015, though we achieved improved contract operations gross margin percentage and lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable in part to our cost management efforts. The reduction in capital spending by our customers in 2016, as well as their delaying maintenance activity on their equipment and in some cases using internal resources to perform work they have historically outsourced, also caused our aftermarket services business to decline in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAlthough, according to the Barclays 2017 Global E&P Spending Outlook, North America upstream spending is expected to increase by 27% in 2017, because compression service providers are a later cycle requirement for improving market conditions, we anticipate any significant increase in the demand for our contract operations services will lag an increase in drilling activity. Also, given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in our contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016.\nDependence on the Partnership. To generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, fund our business and pay dividends, we depend heavily on the distributions attributable to our ownership interest in the Partnership. Our ownership interest in the Partnership, including our limited partner interest, general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in the Partnership, is a significant cash-generating asset for us. As a result, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of the Partnership to make distributions to its partners. Given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in the Partnership's contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016. A decline in the Partnership's business or revenues or increases in its expenses, principal and interest payments under existing and future debt instruments, working capital requirements or other cash needs could limit the amount of cash the Partnership has available to distribute to its unit holders, including us. A reduction in the amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership would reduce the amount of cash available to us for the payment of dividends, the payment of our debt and the funding of our business requirements.\nCapital Requirements and the Availability of External Sources of Capital. We anticipate investing more capital, particularly in new fleet units, in 2017 than we did in 2016 to take advantage of expected improving market conditions during 2017. In order to fund a significant portion of these capital expenditures, we expect to incur borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and we may issue additional debt or equity securities, as appropriate, given market conditions. We have a substantial amount of debt that could limit our ability to fund these capital expenditures. Also, although conditions in the capital and credit markets (both generally and in the oil and gas industry in particular) have improved since the significant decline in oil and natural gas prices in the third quarter of 2014, current conditions could limit our ability to access these markets to raise capital on affordable terms in 2017 and beyond. If we are not successful in raising capital within the time period required or at all, we may not be able to fund these capital expenditures, which could impair our ability to grow or maintain our business.\nCost Management. In January 2016, we determined to undertake a cost reduction program to reduce our on-going operating expenses in light of then current and expected activity levels. This cost reduction program helped to mitigate the impact of the overall decline in our contract operations and aftermarket services businesses during 2016 as a result of the low commodity price environment. However, maintaining cost reductions continues to be challenging, and there is no guarantee that our cost reduction program will continue to result in a reduction in our operating expenses or offset any declines in revenue in 2017.\nPersonnel, Hiring, Training and Retention. We believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be important. Although we have been able to satisfy our personnel needs thus far, retaining employees in our industry continues to be a challenge. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will depend in part on our success in hiring, training and retaining our employees.\nSummary of Results\nAs discussed in Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements, the results from continuing operations for all periods presented exclude the results of Exterran Corporation and our contract water treatment business. Those results are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nNet Income (loss) attributable to Archrock stockholders. We generated net loss attributable to Archrock stockholders of $54.6 million and $132.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net income attributable to Archrock Stockholders of $60.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net loss attributable to Archrock stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by the change in provision for (benefit from) income tax, decreases in long-lived asset impairment, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense and the change in net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. These changes were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin in both our Contract Operations and Aftermarket Services segments and a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net. The change in net income (loss) attributable to Archrock stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in income tax expense driven by a valuation allowance taken against foreign tax credits allocated to Exterran Corporation, an increase in long-lived asset impairment, a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. These activities were partially offset by an increase in gross margin in our contract operations segment and a decrease in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest.\nResults by Business Segment. The following table summarizes revenue, gross margin and gross margin percentages for each of our business segments (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Defined as revenue less cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization expense. Gross margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is reconciled, in total, to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in Part II, Item 6 ( Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n (2) Defined as gross margin divided by revenue. \nOperating Highlights\nThe following table summarizes our total available horsepower, total operating horsepower, average operating horsepower and horsepower utilization percentages (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n (1) Available horsepower is defined as idle and operating horsepower. New units completed by a third party manufacturer that have been delivered to us are included in the fleet. \n (2) Operating horsepower is defined as horsepower that is operating under contract and horsepower that is idle but under contract and generating revenue such as standby revenue. \nThe Year ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2015\nContract Operations\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n(1) Defined as gross margin divided by revenue.\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decline in average operating horsepower and a decrease in rates driven by a decrease in customer demand due to market conditions. Average operating horsepower decreased by 11% from approximately 3,620,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 to approximately 3,234,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross margin decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in revenue explained above, partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales driven by a decrease in repair and maintenance expense and a decrease in lube oil expense. These cost decreases were primarily driven by the decrease in average operating horsepower explained above, a decrease in commodity prices and efficiency gains in lube oil consumption, and cost management initiatives. Gross margin percentage increased primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with the start-up of units, cost management initiatives and the decrease in lube oil explained above.\nAftermarket Services\n(dollars in thousands)\n\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in customer demand for our services. Gross margin decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in revenue partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales as a result of the decrease in customer demand for our services. Gross margin percentage decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to market conditions.\nCosts and Expenses\n(dollars in thousands)\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements, the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a pure play U.S. natural gas contract operations services business and the leading provider of natural gas compression services to customers in the oil and natural gas industry throughout the U.S. and a leading supplier of aftermarket services to customers that own compression equipment in the U.S. Our services are essential to the production, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and are provided primarily to producers and distributors of oil and natural gas. Our geographic business unit operating structure, technically experienced personnel and large fleet of natural gas compression equipment enable us to provide reliable contract operations services to our customers throughout the U.S.\nOur revenues and income are derived from two primary business segments:\n \u2022 Contract Operations. As of December 31, 2016, our contract operations business was largely comprised of our significant equity investment in Archrock Partners, L.P. and its subsidiaries, in addition to our owned fleet of natural gas compression equipment that we use to provide operations services to our customers. \n \u2022 Aftermarket Services. Our aftermarket services business provides a full range of services to support the compression needs of customers. We sell parts and components and provide operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services to customers who own compression equipment. \nArchrock Partners, L.P.\nWe have a significant equity interest in the Partnership, a master limited partnership that provides natural gas contract operations services to customers throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2016, public unitholders held a 55% ownership interest in the Partnership and we owned the remaining equity interest, including all of the general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. We consolidate the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership. It is our intention for the Partnership to be the primary vehicle for the growth of our contract operations business and we may grow the Partnership through third-party acquisitions and organic growth. As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership's fleet included 6,209 compressor units comprising approximately 3.3 million horsepower, or 86% of our and the Partnership's combined total U.S. horsepower.\nAcquisitions and Drop-Downs\nOn November 19, 2016, we sold to the Partnership contract operations customer service agreements with 63 customers and a fleet of 262 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements, comprising approximately 147,000 horsepower, or approximately 4% (of then available horsepower) of our and the Partnership's combined U.S. contract operations business. Total consideration for the transaction was $85.0 million, excluding transaction costs and consisted of the Partnership's issuance to us of approximately 5.5 million common units and approximately 111,000 general partner units. This acquisition of assets by the Partnership from us is referred to as the November 2016 Contract Operations Acquisition.\u201d\nOn March 1, 2016, the Partnership completed an acquisition of contract operations customer service agreements with four customers and a fleet of 19 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements comprising approximately 23,000 horsepower. The $18.8 million purchase price was funded with $13.8 million in borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility, a non-cash exchange of 24 Partnership compressor units for $3.2 million, and the issuance of 257,000 of the Partnership's common units for $1.8 million. In connection with this acquisition, the Partnership issued and sold to GP, our wholly owned subsidiary and the Partnership's general partner, 5,205 general partner units to maintain GP's approximate 2% general partner interest in the Partnership. This acquisition by the Partnership is referred to as the March 2016 Acquisition.\u201d\nOn April 17, 2015, we sold to the Partnership contract operations customer service agreements with 60 customers and a fleet of 238 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements, comprising approximately 148,000 horsepower, or 3% (of then available horsepower) of the combined contract operations business of the Partnership and us. The assets sold to the Partnership also included 179 compressor units, comprising approximately 66,000 horsepower, previously leased by us to the Partnership. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately $102.3 million, excluding transaction costs, and consisted of the Partnership's issuance to us of approximately 4.0 million common units and approximately 80,000 general partner units. Based on the terms of the contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement relating to the acquisition, the common units and general partner units, including incentive distribution rights, we received in this transaction were not entitled to receive a cash distribution relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2015. We refer to this acquisition as the April 2015 Contract Operations Acquisition.\u201d\nSpin-off Transaction\nOn November 3, 2015 (the Distribution Date\u201d), we completed the Spin-off of our international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses into a standalone public company operating as Exterran Corporation. To effect the Spin-off, we distributed on the Distribution Date, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of Exterran Corporation common stock to our stockholders as of October 27, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d). Archrock stockholders received one share of Exterran Corporation common stock for every two shares of our common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date. Upon the completion of the Spin-off, we were renamed Archrock, Inc.\u201d and, on November 4, 2015, the ticker symbol for our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was changed to AROC.\u201d Following the completion of the Spin-off, we and Exterran Corporation are independent, publicly traded companies with separate public ownership, board of directors and management, and we continue to own and operate the U.S. contract operations and aftermarket services businesses that we previously owned. Additionally, we continue to hold our interests in the Partnership, which include the sole general partner interest and certain limited partner interests, as well as all of the incentive distribution rights in the Partnership. Effective on the Distribution Date, the Partnership was renamed Archrock Partners, L.P.,\u201d and, on November 4, 2015, the ticker symbol for its common units on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was changed to APLP.\u201d\nIn order to effect the Spin-off and govern our relationship with Exterran Corporation after the Spin-off, we entered into several agreements with Exterran Corporation on the Distribution Date, including:\n \u2022 Separation and Distribution Agreement. Our separation and distribution agreement with Exterran Corporation contains the key provisions relating to the separation of our business from Exterran Corporation's business. The separation and distribution agreement identifies the assets and rights that were transferred, liabilities that were assumed or retained and contracts and related matters that were assigned to us or Exterran Corporation in the Spin-off and describes how these transfers, assumptions and assignments occurred. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement contains certain noncompetition provisions addressing restrictions for three years after the Spin-off on Exterran Corporation's ability to provide contract operations and aftermarket services in the United States and on our ability to provide contract operations and aftermarket services outside of the United States and to provide products for sale worldwide that compete with Exterran Corporation's product sales business, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, the separation and distribution agreement specifies our right to receive payments from a subsidiary of Exterran Corporation based on a notional amount corresponding to payments received by Exterran Corporation's subsidiaries from PDVSA Gas, a subsidiary of PDVSA, in respect of the sale of Exterran Corporation's subsidiaries' and joint ventures' previously nationalized assets. \n \u2022 Tax Matters Agreement. Our tax matters agreement with Exterran Corporation governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Exterran Corporation and us with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and certain other matters regarding taxes. \n \u2022 Supply Agreement. Our supply agreement with Exterran Corporation sets forth the terms under which Exterran Corporation provides manufactured equipment, including the design, engineering, manufacturing and sale of natural gas compression equipment, on an exclusive basis to us and the Partnership. This supply agreement has an initial term of two years, subject to certain cancellation conditions, and is extendible for additional one-year terms by mutual agreement of the parties. \nResults of operations for Exterran Corporation have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements within Part IV, Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRestatement of Historical Financial Statements\nAs previously disclosed, on January 4, 2017, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Archrock, upon the recommendation of Archrock's management, determined that Archrock's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, including related reports of its independent registered public accounting firm, and the unaudited financial statements for each quarter of 2015 and 2014, should no longer be relied upon.\nThe determination that Archrock's financial statements for the periods listed above should no longer be relied upon was made by Archrock's Audit Committee and management after considering conclusions reached by Exterran Corporation that there were material errors in such historical periods relating to the application of percentage-of-completion accounting principles to certain Belleli engineering, procurement and construction ( EPC\u201d) contracts. Such conclusions were reached, in part, based on the results of an internal investigation into possible accounting irregularities involving the Belleli EPC business. These matters are discussed in detail in Exterran Corporation's Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed on January 4, 2017 and contains restated Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and related footnote disclosures as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (including unaudited quarterly periods within 2015 and 2014). In addition, Exterran Corporation's Form 10-K/A includes restated selected combined statement of operations data and other financial data for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and restated selected combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.\nArchrock's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and related financial information were restated in Archrock's Form 10-K/A, filed on February 9, 2017, to reflect adjustments for the accounting errors identified by Exterran Corporation's management.\nIn connection with the preparation and filing of the above-described restated financial statements, the Company's management, including our principal executive officer and current principal financial officer, determined that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the periods before the completion of the Spin-off on November 3, 2015. We view internal controls over financial reporting as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, Company management, including our principal executive officer and current principal financial officer, has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures in the periods before the completion of the Spin-off on November 3, 2015 were not effective. As a result of the Spin-off, management determined that certain risks and internal controls related to our former international operations, including Belleli EPC, were no longer relevant or necessary. The risks and certain internal controls associated with the material weaknesses noted above were among the risks and internal controls that were determined to be no longer relevant and therefore no remediation was necessary subsequent to the Spin-off on November 3, 2015.\nTrends and Outlook\nOur business environment and corresponding operating results are affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S. Spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is dependent upon these companies' forecasts regarding the expected future supply, demand and pricing of oil and natural gas products as well as their estimates of risk-adjusted costs to find, develop and produce reserves. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Our revenue, earnings and financial position are affected by, among other things, market conditions that impact demand and pricing for natural gas compression, our customers' decisions between using our services or our competitors' services, our customers' decisions regarding whether to own and operate the equipment themselves and the timing and consummation of any acquisition of additional contract operations customer service agreements and equipment from third parties. Although we believe our contract operations business is typically less impacted by commodity prices than certain other oil and natural gas service providers, changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our services.\nNatural gas consumption in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 0.6% to approximately 27,223 billion cubic feet ( Bcf\u201d) compared to approximately 27,395 Bcf for the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA\u201d) forecasts that total U.S. natural gas consumption will increase by 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. The EIA estimates that the U.S. natural gas consumption level will be approximately 30 trillion cubic feet ( Tcf\u201d) in 2040, or 15% of the projected worldwide total of approximately 203 Tcf.\nNatural gas marketed production in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 1.2% to 28,380 Bcf compared to 28,725 Bcf for the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The EIA forecasts that total U.S. natural gas marketed production will increase by 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. The EIA estimates that the U.S. natural gas production level will be approximately 35 Tcf in 2040, or 17% of the projected worldwide total of approximately 202 Tcf.\nHistorically, oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity in the U.S. have been volatile. For example, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $3.71 per million British thermal unit ( MMBtu\u201d) at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 31% higher and 63% higher than prices at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the U.S. natural gas liquid composite price was $5.45 per MMBtu for the month of November 2016, which was approximately 4% higher and 29% higher than prices for the months of September 2016 and December 2015, respectively. While prices at December 31, 2016 improved relative to the comparable periods above, lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices during 2015 and 2016 as compared to 2014 prices caused many companies to reduce their natural gas drilling and production activities during 2015 and further reduce those activities during 2016 from their 2014 levels in select shale plays and in more mature and predominantly dry gas areas in the U.S., where we provide a significant amount of contract operations services. In addition, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price was $53.75 per barrel at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 13% higher and 45% higher than prices at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. While the price at December 31, 2016 improved relative to the comparable periods above, lower West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices during 2015 and 2016 as compared to 2014 prices resulted in a continued decrease in capital investment and in the number of new oil wells drilled by exploration and production companies in 2016 compared to 2015. Because we provide a significant amount of contract operations services related to the production of associated gas from oil wells and the use of gas lift to enhance production of oil from oil wells, our operations and our levels of operating horsepower are also impacted by crude oil drilling and production activity.\nAs a result of the reduction in capital spending and drilling activity by U.S. producers in 2016, we experienced a decline in operating horsepower and an increase in pricing pressure during 2016 compared to 2015, though we achieved improved contract operations gross margin percentage and lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable in part to our cost management efforts. The reduction in capital spending by our customers in 2016, as well as their delaying maintenance activity on their equipment and in some cases using internal resources to perform work they have historically outsourced, also caused our aftermarket services business to decline in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAccording to the Barclays 2017 Global E&P Spending Outlook, North America upstream spending is expected to increase by 27% in 2017. Due to the forecasted increase in customer spending in 2017, we anticipate horsepower returns will moderate during 2017 compared to 2016. We also anticipate investing more capital in new fleet units in 2017 than we did in 2016 to take advantage of expected improving market conditions during 2017. However, because compression service providers are a later cycle participant during improving markets, we anticipate any significant increase in the demand for our contract operations services will lag an increase in drilling activity. Also, given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in our contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016.\nCertain Key Challenges and Uncertainties\nIn addition to general market conditions in the oil and natural gas industry and competition in the natural gas compression industry we believe the following represent some of the key challenges and uncertainties we will face in the near future.\nU.S. Market Conditions. As a result of the reduction in capital spending and drilling activity by U.S. producers in 2016, we experienced a decline in operating horsepower and an increase in pricing pressure from our customers during 2016 compared to 2015, though we achieved improved contract operations gross margin percentage and lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable in part to our cost management efforts. The reduction in capital spending by our customers in 2016, as well as their delaying maintenance activity on their equipment and in some cases using internal resources to perform work they have historically outsourced, also caused our aftermarket services business to decline in 2016 compared to 2015.\nAlthough, according to the Barclays 2017 Global E&P Spending Outlook, North America upstream spending is expected to increase by 27% in 2017, because compression service providers are a later cycle requirement for improving market conditions, we anticipate any significant increase in the demand for our contract operations services will lag an increase in drilling activity. Also, given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in our contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016.\nDependence on the Partnership. To generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, fund our business and pay dividends, we depend heavily on the distributions attributable to our ownership interest in the Partnership. Our ownership interest in the Partnership, including our limited partner interest, general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in the Partnership, is a significant cash-generating asset for us. As a result, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of the Partnership to make distributions to its partners. Given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in the Partnership's contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016. A decline in the Partnership's business or revenues or increases in its expenses, principal and interest payments under existing and future debt instruments, working capital requirements or other cash needs could limit the amount of cash the Partnership has available to distribute to its unit holders, including us. A reduction in the amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership would reduce the amount of cash available to us for the payment of dividends, the payment of our debt and the funding of our business requirements.\nCapital Requirements and the Availability of External Sources of Capital. We anticipate investing more capital, particularly in new fleet units, in 2017 than we did in 2016 to take advantage of expected improving market conditions during 2017. In order to fund a significant portion of these capital expenditures, we expect to incur borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and we may issue additional debt or equity securities, as appropriate, given market conditions. We have a substantial amount of debt that could limit our ability to fund these capital expenditures. Also, although conditions in the capital and credit markets (both generally and in the oil and gas industry in particular) have improved since the significant decline in oil and natural gas prices in the third quarter of 2014, current conditions could limit our ability to access these markets to raise capital on affordable terms in 2017 and beyond. If we are not successful in raising capital within the time period required or at all, we may not be able to fund these capital expenditures, which could impair our ability to grow or maintain our business.\nCost Management. In January 2016, we determined to undertake a cost reduction program to reduce our on-going operating expenses in light of then current and expected activity levels. This cost reduction program helped to mitigate the impact of the overall decline in our contract operations and aftermarket services businesses during 2016 as a result of the low commodity price environment. However, maintaining cost reductions continues to be challenging, and there is no guarantee that our cost reduction program will continue to result in a reduction in our operating expenses or offset any declines in revenue in 2017.\nPersonnel, Hiring, Training and Retention. We believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be important. Although we have been able to satisfy our personnel needs thus far, retaining employees in our industry continues to be a challenge. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will depend in part on our success in hiring, training and retaining our employees.\nSummary of Results\nAs discussed in Note 3 ( Discontinued Operations\u201d) to our Financial Statements, the results from continuing operations for all periods presented exclude the results of Exterran Corporation and our contract water treatment business. Those results are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nNet Income (loss) attributable to Archrock stockholders. We generated net loss attributable to Archrock stockholders of $54.6 million and $132.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net income attributable to Archrock Stockholders of $60.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net loss attributable to Archrock stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by the change in provision for (benefit from) income tax, decreases in long-lived asset impairment, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense and the change in net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. These changes were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin in both our Contract Operations and Aftermarket Services segments and a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net. The change in net income (loss) attributable to Archrock stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in income tax expense driven by a valuation allowance taken against foreign tax credits allocated to Exterran Corporation, an increase in long-lived asset impairment, a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. These activities were partially offset by an increase in gross margin in our contract operations segment and a decrease in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest.\nResults by Business Segment.

Average operating horsepower decreased by 11% from approximately 3,620,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 to approximately 3,234,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross margin decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in revenue explained above, partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales driven by a decrease in repair and maintenance expense and a decrease in lube oil expense. These cost decreases were primarily driven by the decrease in average operating horsepower explained above, a decrease in commodity prices and efficiency gains in lube oil consumption, and cost management initiatives. Gross margin percentage increased primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with the start-up of units, cost management initiatives and the decrease in lube oil explained above.\nAftermarket Services\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense)\n</td> <td>132,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in customer demand for our services.
