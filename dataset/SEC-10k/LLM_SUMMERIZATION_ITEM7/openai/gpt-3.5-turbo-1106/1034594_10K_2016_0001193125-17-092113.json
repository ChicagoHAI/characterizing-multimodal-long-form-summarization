This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOn November 2, 2016, the Company signed a definitive merger agreement with Virginia BanCorp, a bank holding company conducting substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary, Virginia Commonwealth Bank. Upon completion of the merger, the Company will be the surviving corporation and shareholders of Virginia BanCorp will receive 1.178 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of Virginia BanCorp common stock they own. After the merger is completed, the Company's current shareholders will own approximately 51% of the outstanding stock of the Company and Virginia BanCorp's current shareholders will own approximately 49% of the outstanding stock of the Company. After the merger, banking operations will be consolidated and the Bank will operate as Virginia Commonwealth Bank. The merger is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2017, subject to approval of both companies' shareholders, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Regulatory approvals were received in February 2017 and the shareholders approved the merger in March 2017.\nEarnings for 2016 and 2015 were $2.5 million and $366 thousand, respectively. This is an improvement of $2.2 million. Improvements in net interest income, non-interest income, and a reduction in the provision for credit losses all contributed to the increase. Net interest income grew by $1.2 million, non-interest income grew by $1.2 million and provision for loan losses decreased by $1.3 million. Return on average assets improved to 0.55% from 0.09% and return on average equity improved to 6.19% from 0.92%.\nThe in-house loan portfolio grew by $37.8 million, or 10.9%, during 2016. Loans originated and sold to Fannie Mae generated growth of $10.7 million in the servicing portfolio since December 31, 2015. The portfolio of loans serviced for Fannie Mae totaled $82.4 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $71.6 million as of December 31, 2015. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company sold its credit card loan portfolio to an unaffiliated third party. This sale is providing improved customer service for cardholders and reducing the Company's exposure to credit card fraud and security breaches. The Company realized a gain of approximately $150 thousand on the sale of the credit card loan portfolio.\nThe net interest margin declined to 3.40% for 2016 compared to 3.48% in 2015 as new loans are originated at rates lower than existing loans. Expansion into Richmond has generated $61.3 million of loans in that market as of December 31, 2016. Loans in the Richmond market grew $18.9 million in 2016.\nGrowth in loans requires growth in deposits or other borrowings in order to fund those loans, and retail deposits have grown $21.9 million in 2016. This deposit growth has allowed the Company to reduce borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\u201cFHLB') by $5.0 million during 2016.\nLoans past due or non-accruing have declined by $428 thousand to $7.9 million in 2016. Asset quality remains stable with non-performing assets down to 1.6% of total assets at December 31, 2016 compared to 1.8% at December 31, 2015.\nFinally, the Company's core capital levels and regulatory ratios remain well above what is considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d by the Company's regulators.\nFor more information, visit the Company's website at www.baybanks.com. Information contained on the Company's website is not a part of this report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nGENERAL. The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within its statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. For example, historical loss factors are one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in the loan portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors used. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact those transactions could change.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (\u201cALL\u201d). The ALL reflects management's judgment of probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management uses a disciplined process and methodology to establish the ALL each quarter. To determine the total ALL, the Company estimates the reserves needed for each homogenous segment and class of the portfolio, plus any loans analyzed individually for impairment. Depending on the nature of each segment and class, considerations include historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, credit scores, past due history, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing local and national economic conditions, and internal policies and procedures including credit risk management and underwriting. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as conditions change.\nManagement employs a risk rating system to evaluate and consistently categorize loan portfolio credit risk. Loans assigned risk rating grades include all commercial loans not secured by real estate, commercial mortgages, residential mortgages greater than $1 million, smaller residential mortgages which are impaired, loans to real estate developers and contractors, consumer loans greater than $250 thousand with chronic delinquency, and troubled debt restructures (\u201cTDRs\u201d). The grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled. Risk grades are evaluated as new information becomes available for each borrowing relationship or at least quarterly. All other loans not specifically assigned a risk rating grade are monitored as a discrete pool of loans generally based on delinquency status. Risk rating categories are as follows:\nPass - Borrower is strong or sound and collateral securing the loan, if any, is adequate.\nWatch - Borrower exhibits some signs of financial stress but is generally believed to be a satisfactory customer and collateral, if any, may be in excess of 90% of the loan balance.\nSpecial Mention - Adverse trends in the borrower's financial position are evident and warrant management's close attention. Any collateral may not be fully adequate to secure the loan balance.\nSubstandard - A loan in this category has a well-defined weakness in the primary repayment source that jeopardizes the timely collection of the debt. There is a distinct possibility that a loss may result if the weakness is not corrected.\nDoubtful - Default has already occurred and it is likely that foreclosure or repossession procedures have begun or will begin in the near future. Weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing information, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoss - Uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.\nThe ALL consists of specific, general, and unallocated components. The specific component is determined by identifying impaired loans (as described below) then evaluating each one to calculate the amount of impairment. Impaired loans measured for impairment generally include: (1) non-accruing Special mention, Substandard and Doubtful loans in excess of $250,000; (2) Substandard and Doubtful loans in excess of $500,000; (3) Special Mention loans in excess of $500,000 if any of the loans in the relationship are more than 30 days past due or if the borrower has filed for bankruptcy; and (4) all TDRs. A specific allowance arises when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component collectively evaluates smaller commercial loans, residential mortgages and consumer loans, grouped into segments and classes. Historical loss experience is calculated and applied to each segment or class, then adjusted for qualitative factors. Qualitative factors include changes in local and national economic indicators, such as unemployment rates, interest rates, gross domestic product growth and real estate market trends; the level of past due and nonaccrual loans; risk ratings on individual loans; strength of credit policies and procedures; loan officer experience; borrower credit scores; and other intrinsic risks related to the types and geographic locations of loans. These qualitative adjustments reflect management's judgment of risks inherent in the segments. An unallocated component is maintained if needed to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. Changes in the allowance for loan losses and the related provision expense can materially affect net income.\nThe specific component of the ALL calculation accounts for the loan loss reserve necessary on impaired loans. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not considered impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Accrual of interest may or may not be discontinued for any given impaired loan. Impairment is measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Because large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment, the Company does not generally separately identify smaller balance individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are the subject of a troubled debt restructuring agreement.\nThe general component of the ALL calculation collectively evaluates groups of loans in segments and classes, as noted above. The segments are: (1) Mortgage loans on real estate; (2) Commercial and industrial loans; and (3) Consumer and other loans. The segment for Mortgage loans on real estate is disaggregated into the following classes: (1) Construction, land and land development; (2) Farmland; (3) Residential first mortgages; (4) Residential revolving and junior mortgages; (5) Commercial mortgages (non-owner-occupied); and (6) Commercial mortgages (owner-occupied). Loans in segment 1 are secured by real estate. Loans in segments 2 and 3 are secured by other types of collateral or are unsecured. A given segment or class may not reflect the purpose of a loan. For example, a business owner may provide his residence as collateral for a loan to his company, in which case the loan would be grouped in a residential mortgage class. Historical loss factors are calculated for the prior 20 quarters by segment and class, and then applied to the current balances in each segment and class. Finally, qualitative factors are applied to each segment and class.\nConstruction and development loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule or according to budget and the value of the collateral, at any point in time, may be less than the principal amount of the loan. These loans also bear the risk that the general contractor may face financial pressure unrelated to the project. Loans secured by land, farmland and residential mortgages carry the risk of continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and changes in value of the underlying real estate collateral. Commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans carry risks associated with the profitable operation of a business and its related cash flows. Additionally, commercial and industrial loans carry risks associated with the value of collateral other than real estate which may depreciate over time. Consumer loans carry risks associated with the continuing credit-worthiness of the borrower and are more likely than real estate loans to be adversely affected by divorce, unemployment, personal illness or bankruptcy of an individual. Consumer loans secured by automobiles carry risks associated with rapidly depreciating collateral. Consumer loans have historically included credit cards, which are unsecured. The credit card portfolio was sold to an unaffiliated third party in the third quarter of 2016.\nThe summation of the specific, general and unallocated components results in the total estimated ALL. Management may also include an unallocated component to cover uncertainties in the level of probable losses. This estimate is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.\nAdditions to the ALL are made by charges to earnings through the provision for loan losses. Charge-offs result from credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible and the ALL is reduced by these. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited back to the ALL. Charge-off policies are materially the same for all types of loans.\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (\u201cMSRs\u201d). MSRs are included on the consolidated balance sheet and recorded at fair value on an ongoing basis. Changes in the fair value of the MSRs are recorded in the results of operations. A fair value analysis of MSRs is performed on a quarterly basis. A valuation model, which utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates and prepayment assumptions currently quoted for comparable instruments and a discount rate, is used to determine fair value.\nGOODWILL. The Company has goodwill relating to the purchase of five branches during the years 1994 through 2000. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The test performed using financial information as of September 30, 2016 found no impairment. No events that impact long-term enterprise value occurred between the date of our annual test and December 31, 2016 that would indicate the existence of impairment.\nOVERVIEW\n2016 Compared to 2015\nBay Banks of Virginia, Inc. recorded net income for 2016 of $2.5 million, or $0.53 per basic and diluted share, as compared to $366 thousand, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share in 2015. This is an increase in net income of $2.2 million. Net interest income for 2016 was $14.4 million, as compared to $13.2 million for 2015, an increase of 9.0%. Provision expense for loan losses was $287 thousand in 2016 compared to $1.6 million in 2015. Non-interest income increased 37.2% to $4.6 million in 2016 from $3.4 million in 2015. Non-interest expense was $15.2 million in 2016 compared to $14.8 million in 2015.\nPerformance as measured by the Company's return on average assets was 0.55% for 2016 compared to 0.09% for 2015. Performance as measured by return on average equity was 6.19% for 2016 compared to 0.92% for 2015. The table below details certain financial and statistical information for the Company relating to income and returns.\nReturn on Equity & Assets\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Total Assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>464,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>416,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>343,838 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on Average Assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.53 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,418 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on Average Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Dividends declared per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Shares Outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,774,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,791,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,818,377 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Diluted Shares Outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,799,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,805,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,829,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income per Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income per Diluted Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Dividend Payout Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Equity to Average Assets Ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.53 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income\nThe principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income is the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense. The net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the associated yields and rates, and the volume of non-performing assets have a significant impact on net interest income, the net interest margin, and ultimately net income.\nThe following table shows details of yields on interest-earning assets (e.g. loans), costs of interest-bearing liabilities (e.g. deposits) and the resulting net interest margins for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expense, Yields and Rates\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

program, nonaccrual loans, and fees. </td> </tr>\n</table> Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to $14.7 million in 2016 from $13.4 million in 2015, as the increase in interest income exceeded the increase in interest expense. Interest income for 2016, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $18.2 million, an increase of $1.7 million from 2015 due mainly to increased loan balances. Interest expense for 2016 was $3.5 million, an increase of $491 thousand compared to 2015, due primarily to increases in money market deposit accounts and the issuance of $7.0 million of subordinated debt in May 2015 bearing interest at a rate of 6.50%. The annualized net interest margin was 3.40% and 3.48% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. As long as loan rates remain flat, it is expected that the Bank's loan yields will continue to decline as higher yielding loans pay down or mature and new loans are made at lower rates.\nThe net interest spread, which is the difference between the annualized yield on earning assets and the total cost of funds, decreased to 3.38% for 2016, compared to 3.45% for 2015.\nThe increase in average total earning assets is due mainly to the $38.2 million increase in average loan balances. Investment yields increased 54 basis points in 2016 compared to 2015 while loan yields have declined 18 basis points. Loan growth offset the decline in loan yields. Although the Federal Open Market Committee has commenced increases in short term rates, long term rates, which are generally the rates that affect the Bank's yields, have not increased. Therefore, any growth in net interest income will need to be generated from loan growth.\nThe increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due mainly to the increase of $33.1 million in average deposit balances. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased to 0.85% in 2016 from 0.89% in 2015. The cost of FHLB advances was 1.54% in 2016 compared to 1.08% in 2015. In May 2015, the Company issued $7.0 million of 6.50% 10-year subordinated debt. Average non-interest-bearing deposits grew $9.9 million during 2016. Total cost of funds was 0.84% in 2016 compared to 0.81% in 2015, due mainly to higher costs of FHLB balances and the addition of subordinated debt.\nVolume and Rate Analysis of Changes in Net Interest

indicated in the volume and rate analysis, the growth in loans in 2016 was the primary driver of improved net interest income. The increase in interest expense was also driven mainly by increases in money market accounts and subordinated notes. The sustained low interest rate environment has led to compression of the net interest margin.\nInterest Sensitivity\nThe Company employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its exposure to changing interest rates and subsequent changes in liquidity. The Company utilizes simulation models that estimate the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and the economic value of equity. The Company engages an asset-liability management consultant to assist with the management of interest rate risk, liquidity risk and balance sheet strategy. The Bank's Asset Liability Committee (the \u201cALCO\u201d) is responsible for monitoring interest rate risk and is composed of appointed members from management and the Board of Directors. Through the use of simulations, the ALCO reviews the overall magnitude of interest rate risk and then formulates policy with which to manage asset growth, funding sources, pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments. These decisions are based on management's plans for growth, expectations regarding future interest rate movements, economic conditions both locally and nationally, and other business and risk factors.\nThe simulation models indicate that the Bank's balance sheet is neutral to asset sensitive, which management believes is favorable in the current interest rate environment. This means that as rates rise, interest-earning assets should reprice as fast, or faster than interest-bearing liabilities, allowing interest income to rise as fast or faster than interest expense. Thus, net interest income should remain stable or grow. Moderate growth in the balance sheet is expected to assure continued growth in net interest income.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for 2016 totaled $4.6 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 37.2%, compared to $3.4 million for 2015. The difference in non-interest income was primarily driven by the following changes:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>In 2016, the Company realized $435 thousand in gains on the sale of securities compared to $42 thousand in 2015, an increase of $393 thousand. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>Losses on the sale of other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) were lower in 2016 than 2015 by $268 thousand. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>A $214 thousand increase in secondary market lending fees. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>Fiduciary fees increased $169 thousand in 2016 compared to 2015. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>In 2016, the Company sold its VISA credit card portfolio realizing a gain of $150 thousand. </td> </tr>\n</table> Non-Interest Expense\nFor 2016, non-interest expenses totaled $15.2 million, an increase of $431 thousand, or 2.9%, compared to $14.8 million for 2015. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily the result of the following increases:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>$575 thousand in merger related costs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>$76 thousand in bank franchise taxes. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>$65 thousand in FDIC assessments resulting from higher asset balances. </td> </tr>\n</table> These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $202 thousand in salaries and benefits primarily due to $143 thousand of severance expense recognized in 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $966 thousand in 2016 compared to $(187) thousand in 2015. This is directly attributable to the Company's increase in pretax income and the relationship of tax-exempt income to pretax income. Income tax expense (benefit) corresponds to an effective rate of 27.6% and (104.5)% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation between the amounts of income tax expense computed using the federal statutory income tax rate and actual income tax expense. Also included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K is information regarding deferred taxes for 2016 and 2015.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLoans\nPer the following table, which does not include deferred loan costs and fees, the loan portfolio grew during 2016 with balances increasing by 10.9% to $385.0 million as of December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015 balances of $347.2 million. Mortgage loans on real estate represent the largest category, comprising 87.9% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. Of these balances, 1-4 family residential loans, which comprise the majority of real estate loan balances at $220.4 million, increased by $29.5 million, or 15.5%. Other loans secured by real estate, the majority of which are commercial in nature, increased by $4.1 million, or 5.6%, and represent 20.0% of the loan portfolio at year-end 2016 as compared to 21.0% at year-end 2015. Construction and land loans decreased $2.3 million, or 5.5%. Commercial and industrial loan balances increased by $7.9 million, or 22.6%, and represented 11.2% of total loans at year-end 2016 as compared to 10.1% at year-end 2015. Consumer and other loans decreased by $1.5 million, or 29.3% in 2016, and represented 0.9% of total loans at year-end 2016 as compared to 1.5% at year-end 2015. This decrease is primarily related to the sale of the VISA credit card portfolio in 2016.\nTypes of Loans\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

charge against earnings that is necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level consistent with management's evaluation of the loan portfolio's inherent risk. For a detailed description of the ALL calculation, refer to Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAs shown in the following table, the provision for loan losses was $287 thousand in 2016 compared to $1.6 million in 2015. After net charge-offs of $620 thousand, the ALL is $3.9 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $4.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in the provision expense and ALL is due primarily to additional impairment reserves in 2015 for one commercial borrower who pleaded guilty in a federal court to \u201cWillful Failure to Collect or Pay Over Employment Tax\u201d and admitted to regularly and deliberately creating false financial statements for submission to financial institutions in order to encourage banks to lend new funds to his companies, or to enable the renewal of existing loans. This level of net charge-offs represents 0.17% of average loans compared to 0.18% in 2015. The quantitative portion of the ALL for non-impaired loans continues to decline as average net charge-offs included in the model continue to decline and that decline is being offset by an increase in qualitative factors. As of December 31, 2016, management considered the allowance for loan losses to be sufficient to cover estimated potential loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan

assets was 1.6%, compared to 1.8% at year-end 2015. The coverage ratio of allowance to total non-performing loans increased to 72.9% at year-end 2016 from 65.6% at year-end 2015. OREO, including solely foreclosed properties, at year-end 2016 was $2.5 million compared to $1.9 million at year-end 2015. The year-end 2016 figure represents two residences, seven lots, a former convenience store, a former restaurant and three commercial business properties. The Company sold seven OREO properties with a total value of $1.3 million in 2016 for total losses of $74 thousand, and six properties with a total value of $1.9 million from five borrowers were added through foreclosure. After foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations and the real estate is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. As a result, in addition to losses on sales, the Company wrote down OREO property values by $53 thousand in 2016. Included in other assets are one residential property and one commercial property, with a value of $1.1 million. These properties were not obtained as a result of a foreclosure and are being marketed for sale.\nDuring 2016, non-accruing loan balances decreased by $1.1 million. Of the $5.3 million in non-accruing balances, $2.2 million are residential mortgages. The net decrease in non-accruing loan balances from 2015 to 2016 was comprised of $3.0 million in new non-accruing loans less $28 thousand in charge-offs, $762 thousand of foreclosures, $219 thousand of upgrades and $887 thousand in paydowns.

</tr>\n</table> The Company currently classifies the entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale in order that it may be considered a source of liquidity, if necessary. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair market value, with after-tax unrealized gains or losses disclosed as a component of comprehensive income. The after-tax unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a portion of other comprehensive income in the equity of the Company, but have no impact on earnings until such time as the gain or loss is realized, typically at the time of sale. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had accumulated other comprehensive (losses) gains net of deferred tax related to securities available-for-sale of $(520) thousand as compared to $107 thousand at year-end 2015.\nThe investment portfolio shows a net unrealized (loss) gain of $(756) thousand on December 31, 2016, compared to $166 thousand on December 31, 2015.\nImpairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in net income if (i) there is evidence of credit related impairment; (ii) we intend to sell the security or (iii) it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As a result, temporary impairment can occur with rising interest rates, since the market value of a fixed income investment will fall as interest rates rise. Conversely, market values will increase as interest rates fall.\nThe Company seeks to diversify its assets to minimize risk by maintaining a large portion of its investment portfolio in securities issued by states and political subdivisions. Many of these types of securities also provide tax benefits. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations held in the investment portfolio provide liquidity via cashflows, and are solely issued by agencies of the U.S. government. The Company owns no derivatives, and participates in no hedging activities.\nFor more information on the Company's investment portfolio, please refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements

The adequacy of the Company's capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis with reference to size, composition, and quality of the Company's resources and consistency with regulatory requirements and industry standards. Management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses, yet allow management to effectively leverage its capital to maximize return to shareholders. The Company's capital, also known as equity, is comprised mainly of outstanding stock and retained earnings. Capital can be increased with a variety of stock offerings or through earnings. Management believes the capital level at December 31, 2016, is sufficient to support growth and acquisition opportunities.\nThe parent company obtains its operating funds primarily through management fees paid by the Bank and Trust Company. The parent company could also receive dividends from its subsidiaries.\nDuring 2016, the Bank was required to maintain minimum amounts of capital per Federal Reserve capital guidelines. The minimum total capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 8.0%, the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 6.0%, the minimum Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets ratio (leverage ratio) was 4.0% and the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 4.5% of risk-weighted assets. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank maintained Common Equity Tier 1 capital of $43.1 million, Tier 1 capital of $43.1 million, risk weighted assets of $343.3 million and total risk-based capital of $47.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank maintained Common Equity Tier 1 capital of $39.0 million, Tier 1 capital of $39.0 million, risk weighted assets of $314.7 million and total capital of $42.9 million. As of December 31, 2016, all ratios were in excess of the fully phased-in requirements of the Basel III regulatory capital framework, with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 12.56% of risk-weighted assets, the Tier 1 capital ratio at 12.56% of risk-weighted assets, the total capital ratio at 13.69% of risk-weighted assets and the Tier 1 leverage ratio at 9.18% of total assets.\nFor more detailed information, refer to Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nTotal capital, before accumulated other comprehensive income, increased by 6.4% to $42.9 million as of December 31, 2016 as compared to $40.3 million as of December 31, 2015. Accumulated other comprehensive loss was $1.2 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $776 thousand as of December 31, 2015. The increase in the accumulated loss is due primarily to an increase in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, a result of increased market rates.\nLIQUIDITY\nLiquidity represents an institution's ability to meet present and future financial obligations (such as commitments to fund loans) through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, federal funds sold and investments and loans maturing within one year. The Company's ability to obtain deposits and purchase funds at favorable rates is a factor in the management of liquidity. Management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity that is more than sufficient to satisfy its depositors' requirements and to meet its customers' credit needs.\nAt December 31, 2016, liquid assets totaled $40.3 million or 8.3% of total assets, a decrease from $55.7 million and 12.1% at December 31, 2015. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Company include its capacity to borrow additional funds when necessary. The Bank maintains federal funds lines with regional banks totaling approximately $21.5 million. In addition, the Bank has total borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $115.9 million, with $74.9 million immediately available as of December 31, 2016.\nThe table below presents selected information on short-term borrowings:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance outstanding at period-end\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,012 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum balance at any month end during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average balance for the period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate for the period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average rate on borrowings at period end\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The impact of contractual obligations includes five FHLB advances, subordinated debt, time deposits and securities sold under repurchase agreements. There are four fixed rate FHLB advances totaling $25.0 million and one variable rate advance of $10.0 million as of December 31, 2016. A $5.0 million fixed rate advance matured in January 2017 and was replaced with an 11 month 0.995% fixed rate advance. The advance maturing in February 2017 was replaced with a three month 0.79% fixed rate advance. Two new fixed rate advances of $5.0 million have been drawn thus far in 2017. For details on these advances, please refer to Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOn May 28, 2015, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement under which the Company issued an aggregate of $7,000,000 of subordinated notes to accredited investors. The Notes have a maturity date of May 28, 2025. The Notes bear interest, payable on the 1st of March and September of each year, commencing September 1, 2015, at a fixed interest rate of 6.50% per year. The Notes are not convertible into common stock or preferred stock, and are not callable by the holders. The Company has the right to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any interest payment date on or after May 28, 2020 and prior to the maturity date, but in all cases in a principal amount with integral multiples of $1,000, plus interest accrued and unpaid through the date of redemption. If an event of default occurs, such as the bankruptcy of the Company, the holder of a Note may declare the principal amount of the Note to be due and immediately payable. The Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Company and rank junior in right of payment to the Company's existing and future senior indebtedness. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory reporting.\nThe following table presents the Company's contractual obligations and scheduled payment amounts, excluding interest, due at various intervals over the next five years and beyond as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over 5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB advances\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits maturities (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,050 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities sold under repurchase agreements (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Note:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements </td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2016, the Company was not aware of any other known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on liquidity. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has no material commitments or long-term debt for capital expenditures.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, the Company offers various financial products to its customers to meet their credit and liquidity needs. These instruments frequently involve elements of liquidity, credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby-letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. Subject to its normal credit standards and risk monitoring procedures, the Company makes contractual commitments to extend credit. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Conditional commitments are issued by the Company in the form of performance stand-by letters of credit, which guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. The credit risk of issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Loan Commitments Outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby-by Letters of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Low income housing tax credit funds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The Company maintains liquidity and credit facilities with non-affiliated banks in excess of the total loan commitments and stand-by letters of credit. As these commitments are earning assets only upon takedown of the instrument by the customer, thereby increasing loan balances, management expects the revenue of the Company to be enhanced as these credit facilities are utilized.\nSTATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains statements concerning the Company's expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of Bay Banks of Virginia, Inc., and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOn November 2, 2016, the Company signed a definitive merger agreement with Virginia BanCorp, a bank holding company conducting substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary, Virginia Commonwealth Bank. Upon completion of the merger, the Company will be the surviving corporation and shareholders of Virginia BanCorp will receive 1.178 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of Virginia BanCorp common stock they own. After the merger is completed, the Company's current shareholders will own approximately 51% of the outstanding stock of the Company and Virginia BanCorp's current shareholders will own approximately 49% of the outstanding stock of the Company. After the merger, banking operations will be consolidated and the Bank will operate as Virginia Commonwealth Bank. The merger is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2017, subject to approval of both companies' shareholders, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Regulatory approvals were received in February 2017 and the shareholders approved the merger in March 2017.\nEarnings for 2016 and 2015 were $2.5 million and $366 thousand, respectively. This is an improvement of $2.2 million. Improvements in net interest income, non-interest income, and a reduction in the provision for credit losses all contributed to the increase. Net interest income grew by $1.2 million, non-interest income grew by $1.2 million and provision for loan losses decreased by $1.3 million. Return on average assets improved to 0.55% from 0.09% and return on average equity improved to 6.19% from 0.92%.\nThe in-house loan portfolio grew by $37.8 million, or 10.9%, during 2016. Loans originated and sold to Fannie Mae generated growth of $10.7 million in the servicing portfolio since December 31, 2015. The portfolio of loans serviced for Fannie Mae totaled $82.4 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $71.6 million as of December 31, 2015. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company sold its credit card loan portfolio to an unaffiliated third party. This sale is providing improved customer service for cardholders and reducing the Company's exposure to credit card fraud and security breaches. The Company realized a gain of approximately $150 thousand on the sale of the credit card loan portfolio.\nThe net interest margin declined to 3.40% for 2016 compared to 3.48% in 2015 as new loans are originated at rates lower than existing loans. Expansion into Richmond has generated $61.3 million of loans in that market as of December 31, 2016. Loans in the Richmond market grew $18.9 million in 2016.\nGrowth in loans requires growth in deposits or other borrowings in order to fund those loans, and retail deposits have grown $21.9 million in 2016. This deposit growth has allowed the Company to reduce borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\u201cFHLB') by $5.0 million during 2016.\nLoans past due or non-accruing have declined by $428 thousand to $7.9 million in 2016. Asset quality remains stable with non-performing assets down to 1.6% of total assets at December 31, 2016 compared to 1.8% at December 31, 2015.\nFinally, the Company's core capital levels and regulatory ratios remain well above what is considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d by the Company's regulators.\nFor more information, visit the Company's website at www.baybanks.com. Information contained on the Company's website is not a part of this report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nGENERAL. The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within its statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. For example, historical loss factors are one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in the loan portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors used. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact those transactions could change.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (\u201cALL\u201d). The ALL reflects management's judgment of probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management uses a disciplined process and methodology to establish the ALL each quarter. To determine the total ALL, the Company estimates the reserves needed for each homogenous segment and class of the portfolio, plus any loans analyzed individually for impairment. Depending on the nature of each segment and class, considerations include historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, credit scores, past due history, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing local and national economic conditions, and internal policies and procedures including credit risk management and underwriting. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as conditions change.\nManagement employs a risk rating system to evaluate and consistently categorize loan portfolio credit risk. Loans assigned risk rating grades include all commercial loans not secured by real estate, commercial mortgages, residential mortgages greater than $1 million, smaller residential mortgages which are impaired, loans to real estate developers and contractors, consumer loans greater than $250 thousand with chronic delinquency, and troubled debt restructures (\u201cTDRs\u201d). The grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled. Risk grades are evaluated as new information becomes available for each borrowing relationship or at least quarterly. All other loans not specifically assigned a risk rating grade are monitored as a discrete pool of loans generally based on delinquency status. Risk rating categories are as follows:\nPass - Borrower is strong or sound and collateral securing the loan, if any, is adequate.\nWatch - Borrower exhibits some signs of financial stress but is generally believed to be a satisfactory customer and collateral, if any, may be in excess of 90% of the loan balance.\nSpecial Mention - Adverse trends in the borrower's financial position are evident and warrant management's close attention. Any collateral may not be fully adequate to secure the loan balance.\nSubstandard - A loan in this category has a well-defined weakness in the primary repayment source that jeopardizes the timely collection of the debt. There is a distinct possibility that a loss may result if the weakness is not corrected.\nDoubtful - Default has already occurred and it is likely that foreclosure or repossession procedures have begun or will begin in the near future. Weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing information, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoss - Uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.\nThe ALL consists of specific, general, and unallocated components. The specific component is determined by identifying impaired loans (as described below) then evaluating each one to calculate the amount of impairment. Impaired loans measured for impairment generally include: (1) non-accruing Special mention, Substandard and Doubtful loans in excess of $250,000; (2) Substandard and Doubtful loans in excess of $500,000; (3) Special Mention loans in excess of $500,000 if any of the loans in the relationship are more than 30 days past due or if the borrower has filed for bankruptcy; and (4) all TDRs. A specific allowance arises when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component collectively evaluates smaller commercial loans, residential mortgages and consumer loans, grouped into segments and classes. Historical loss experience is calculated and applied to each segment or class, then adjusted for qualitative factors. Qualitative factors include changes in local and national economic indicators, such as unemployment rates, interest rates, gross domestic product growth and real estate market trends; the level of past due and nonaccrual loans; risk ratings on individual loans; strength of credit policies and procedures; loan officer experience; borrower credit scores; and other intrinsic risks related to the types and geographic locations of loans. These qualitative adjustments reflect management's judgment of risks inherent in the segments. An unallocated component is maintained if needed to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. Changes in the allowance for loan losses and the related provision expense can materially affect net income.\nThe specific component of the ALL calculation accounts for the loan loss reserve necessary on impaired loans. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not considered impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Accrual of interest may or may not be discontinued for any given impaired loan. Impairment is measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Because large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment, the Company does not generally separately identify smaller balance individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are the subject of a troubled debt restructuring agreement.\nThe general component of the ALL calculation collectively evaluates groups of loans in segments and classes, as noted above. The segments are: (1) Mortgage loans on real estate; (2) Commercial and industrial loans; and (3) Consumer and other loans. The segment for Mortgage loans on real estate is disaggregated into the following classes: (1) Construction, land and land development; (2) Farmland; (3) Residential first mortgages; (4) Residential revolving and junior mortgages; (5) Commercial mortgages (non-owner-occupied); and (6) Commercial mortgages (owner-occupied). Loans in segment 1 are secured by real estate. Loans in segments 2 and 3 are secured by other types of collateral or are unsecured. A given segment or class may not reflect the purpose of a loan. For example, a business owner may provide his residence as collateral for a loan to his company, in which case the loan would be grouped in a residential mortgage class. Historical loss factors are calculated for the prior 20 quarters by segment and class, and then applied to the current balances in each segment and class. Finally, qualitative factors are applied to each segment and class.\nConstruction and development loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule or according to budget and the value of the collateral, at any point in time, may be less than the principal amount of the loan. These loans also bear the risk that the general contractor may face financial pressure unrelated to the project. Loans secured by land, farmland and residential mortgages carry the risk of continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and changes in value of the underlying real estate collateral. Commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans carry risks associated with the profitable operation of a business and its related cash flows. Additionally, commercial and industrial loans carry risks associated with the value of collateral other than real estate which may depreciate over time. Consumer loans carry risks associated with the continuing credit-worthiness of the borrower and are more likely than real estate loans to be adversely affected by divorce, unemployment, personal illness or bankruptcy of an individual. Consumer loans secured by automobiles carry risks associated with rapidly depreciating collateral. Consumer loans have historically included credit cards, which are unsecured. The credit card portfolio was sold to an unaffiliated third party in the third quarter of 2016.\nThe summation of the specific, general and unallocated components results in the total estimated ALL. Management may also include an unallocated component to cover uncertainties in the level of probable losses. This estimate is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.\nAdditions to the ALL are made by charges to earnings through the provision for loan losses. Charge-offs result from credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible and the ALL is reduced by these. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited back to the ALL. Charge-off policies are materially the same for all types of loans.\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (\u201cMSRs\u201d). MSRs are included on the consolidated balance sheet and recorded at fair value on an ongoing basis. Changes in the fair value of the MSRs are recorded in the results of operations. A fair value analysis of MSRs is performed on a quarterly basis. A valuation model, which utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates and prepayment assumptions currently quoted for comparable instruments and a discount rate, is used to determine fair value.\nGOODWILL. The Company has goodwill relating to the purchase of five branches during the years 1994 through 2000. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The test performed using financial information as of September 30, 2016 found no impairment. No events that impact long-term enterprise value occurred between the date of our annual test and December 31, 2016 that would indicate the existence of impairment.\nOVERVIEW\n2016 Compared to 2015\nBay Banks of Virginia, Inc. recorded net income for 2016 of $2.5 million, or $0.53 per basic and diluted share, as compared to $366 thousand, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share in 2015. This is an increase in net income of $2.2 million. Net interest income for 2016 was $14.4 million, as compared to $13.2 million for 2015, an increase of 9.0%. Provision expense for loan losses was $287 thousand in 2016 compared to $1.6 million in 2015. Non-interest income increased 37.2% to $4.6 million in 2016 from $3.4 million in 2015. Non-interest expense was $15.2 million in 2016 compared to $14.8 million in 2015.\nPerformance as measured by the Company's return on average assets was 0.55% for 2016 compared to 0.09% for 2015. Performance as measured by return on average equity was 6.19% for 2016 compared to 0.92% for 2015. The table below details certain financial and statistical information for the Company relating to income and returns.\nReturn on Equity & Assets\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income\nThe principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income is the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense. The net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the associated yields and rates, and the volume of non-performing assets have a significant impact on net interest income, the net interest margin, and ultimately net income.\nThe following table shows details of yields on interest-earning assets (e.g. loans), costs of interest-bearing liabilities (e.g. deposits) and the resulting net interest margins for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expense, Yields and Rates\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of Bay Banks of Virginia, Inc., and its subsidiaries.

After the merger, banking operations will be consolidated and the Bank will operate as Virginia Commonwealth Bank. The merger is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2017, subject to approval of both companies' shareholders, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Regulatory approvals were received in February 2017 and the shareholders approved the merger in March 2017.\nEarnings for 2016 and 2015 were $2.5 million and $366 thousand, respectively. This is an improvement of $2.2 million. Improvements in net interest income, non-interest income, and a reduction in the provision for credit losses all contributed to the increase. Net interest income grew by $1.2 million, non-interest income grew by $1.2 million and provision for loan losses decreased by $1.3 million. Return on average assets improved to 0.55% from 0.09% and return on average equity improved to 6.19% from 0.92%.\nThe in-house loan portfolio grew by $37.8 million, or 10.9%, during 2016. Loans originated and sold to Fannie Mae generated growth of $10.7 million in the servicing portfolio since December 31, 2015. The portfolio of loans serviced for Fannie Mae totaled $82.4 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $71.6 million as of December 31, 2015.

Asset quality remains stable with non-performing assets down to 1.6% of total assets at December 31, 2016 compared to 1.8% at December 31, 2015.\nFinally, the Company's core capital levels and regulatory ratios remain well above what is considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d by the Company's regulators.\nFor more information, visit the Company's website at www.baybanks.com. Information contained on the Company's website is not a part of this report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nGENERAL.

The financial information contained within its statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred.

Although the economics of transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact those transactions could change.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (\u201cALL\u201d). The ALL reflects management's judgment of probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management uses a disciplined process and methodology to establish the ALL each quarter.

Loans assigned risk rating grades include all commercial loans not secured by real estate, commercial mortgages, residential mortgages greater than $1 million, smaller residential mortgages which are impaired, loans to real estate developers and contractors, consumer loans greater than $250 thousand with chronic delinquency, and troubled debt restructures (\u201cTDRs\u201d).

The specific component is determined by identifying impaired loans (as described below) then evaluating each one to calculate the amount of impairment. Impaired loans measured for impairment generally include: (1) non-accruing Special mention, Substandard and Doubtful loans in excess of $250,000; (2) Substandard and Doubtful loans in excess of $500,000; (3) Special Mention loans in excess of $500,000 if any of the loans in the relationship are more than 30 days past due or if the borrower has filed for bankruptcy; and (4) all TDRs. A specific allowance arises when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component collectively evaluates smaller commercial loans, residential mortgages and consumer loans, grouped into segments and classes. Historical loss experience is calculated and applied to each segment or class, then adjusted for qualitative factors. Qualitative factors include changes in local and national economic indicators, such as unemployment rates, interest rates, gross domestic product growth and real estate market trends; the level of past due and nonaccrual loans; risk ratings on individual loans; strength of credit policies and procedures; loan officer experience; borrower credit scores; and other intrinsic risks related to the types and geographic locations of loans. These qualitative adjustments reflect management's judgment of risks inherent in the segments. An unallocated component is maintained if needed to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. Changes in the allowance for loan losses and the related provision expense can materially affect net income.\nThe specific component of the ALL calculation accounts for the loan loss reserve necessary on impaired loans. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.

Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Accrual of interest may or may not be discontinued for any given impaired loan. Impairment is measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Because large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment, the Company does not generally separately identify smaller balance individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are the subject of a troubled debt restructuring agreement.\nThe general component of the ALL calculation collectively evaluates groups of loans in segments and classes, as noted above. The segments are: (1) Mortgage loans on real estate; (2) Commercial and industrial loans; and (3) Consumer and other loans. The segment for Mortgage loans on real estate is disaggregated into the following classes: (1) Construction, land and land development; (2) Farmland; (3) Residential first mortgages; (4) Residential revolving and junior mortgages; (5) Commercial mortgages (non-owner-occupied); and (6) Commercial mortgages (owner-occupied). Loans in segment 1 are secured by real estate. Loans in segments 2 and 3 are secured by other types of collateral or are unsecured. A given segment or class may not reflect the purpose of a loan. For example, a business owner may provide his residence as collateral for a loan to his company, in which case the loan would be grouped in a residential mortgage class. Historical loss factors are calculated for the prior 20 quarters by segment and class, and then applied to the current balances in each segment and class. Finally, qualitative factors are applied to each segment and class.\nConstruction and development loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule or according to budget and the value of the collateral, at any point in time, may be less than the principal amount of the loan. These loans also bear the risk that the general contractor may face financial pressure unrelated to the project. Loans secured by land, farmland and residential mortgages carry the risk of continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and changes in value of the underlying real estate collateral.

This estimate is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.\nAdditions to the ALL are made by charges to earnings through the provision for loan losses. Charge-offs result from credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible and the ALL is reduced by these. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited back to the ALL. Charge-off policies are materially the same for all types of loans.\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (\u201cMSRs\u201d).

Net interest income is the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense. The net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the associated yields and rates, and the volume of non-performing assets have a significant impact on net interest income, the net interest margin, and ultimately net income.\nThe following table shows details of yields on interest-earning assets (e.g. loans), costs of interest-bearing liabilities (e.g. deposits) and the resulting net interest margins for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expense, Yields and Rates\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>
